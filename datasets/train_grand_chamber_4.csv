57,001-108072,Grand Chamber,"9.The first applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Brighton. The facts which gave rise to his application are as follows. 10.While working as a consultant physician in the field of rehabilitative medicine, the first applicant was charged on two counts of indecent assault on two female patients while they were allegedly under hypnosis. The first count in the indictment alleged that he had indecently assaulted a woman called S.T. during a consultation on 3 June 2003. The second count in the indictment alleged that he had indecently assaulted a woman called V.U. also during a consultation, this time on 12 June 2003. 11.For reasons unrelated to the alleged assault, S.T. committed suicide before the trial. However, several months after the alleged assault, she had made a statement to the police. She had also told two friends, B.F. and S.H., that the applicant had indecently assaulted her. 11.For reasons unrelated to the alleged assault, S.T. committed suicide before the trial. However, several months after the alleged assault, she had made a statement to the police. She had also told two friends, B.F. and S.H., that the applicant had indecently assaulted her. 12.On 22 March 2004 a preliminary hearing was held to determine whether S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury. At that hearing, the defence indicated that the defence to each count of the indictment was essentially the same, namely that S.T. and V.U.’s allegations were wholly untrue. The judge at the hearing decided that S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury at trial. He observed that the first applicant was very likely to feel that he had no realistic alternative other than to give evidence in order to defend himself on the second count relating to V.U. Therefore, the reading of S.T.’s statement would not have the effect of making it very difficult for the applicant not to give evidence. The judge also noted that collusion between S.T. and V.U. was not alleged, and so that issue did not need to be investigated by cross-examination of each woman. 12.On 22 March 2004 a preliminary hearing was held to determine whether S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury.

The judge also noted that collusion between S.T. and V.U. was not alleged, and so that issue did not need to be investigated by cross-examination of each woman. 13.Having regard to the contents of S.T.’s statement, the judge also observed that it was crucial to the prosecution on count one as there was no other direct evidence of what took place during the consultation on 3 June 2003. He said: “[P]utting it bluntly, no statement, no count one.” He went on to observe that the real issue was whether it was likely to be possible for the first applicant to controvert the statement in a way that achieved fairness to the defendant. The judge found that the first applicant could give evidence as to what had happened during the consultation. It was also the intention of the prosecution to call S.T.’s friends to give evidence as to what she had said to them. There were inconsistencies between their statements and S.T.’s, which provided a route by which S.T.’s statement could be challenged. An expert witness would also be called by the prosecution to give evidence on altered perception during hypnosis and cross-examination of that witness might also serve to undermine S.T.’s credibility. 14.At the trial, once S.T.’s statement had been read, the jury heard evidence from B.F. and S.H., S.T.’s friends. S.T.’s general practitioner also gave evidence as to a letter he had written on S.T.’s behalf to the hospital authorities, which outlined S.T.’s allegations against the first applicant. In respect of the second count, the indecent assault upon V.U., evidence was given by V.U. and by the police officers who had investigated the case. Evidence was then given by two women who alleged that the first applicant had made improper suggestions to them during hypnosis consultations. That evidence was relied on by the prosecution as “similar fact evidence” to support the evidence of S.T. and V.U. As the prosecution had indicated, expert evidence was given as to the effects of hypnosis. The defence was given the opportunity to cross-examine all the witnesses who gave live evidence. The first applicant gave evidence in his own defence. He also called a number of witnesses, who gave evidence as to his good character. 14.At the trial, once S.T.’s statement had been read, the jury heard evidence from B.F. and S.H., S.T.’s friends.

The first applicant gave evidence in his own defence. He also called a number of witnesses, who gave evidence as to his good character. 15.In his summing up, the trial judge directed the jury, on two separate occasions, as to how they should regard S.T.’s statement. Firstly, he stated: “It is very important that you [the jury] bear in mind when considering her [S.T.’s] evidence that you have not seen her give evidence; you have not heard her give evidence; and you have not heard her evidence tested in cross-examination [by counsel for Mr Al-Khawaja], who would, undoubtedly, have had a number of questions to put to her.” “It is very important that you [the jury] bear in mind when considering her [S.T.’s] evidence that you have not seen her give evidence; you have not heard her give evidence; and you have not heard her evidence tested in cross-examination [by counsel for Mr Al-Khawaja], who would, undoubtedly, have had a number of questions to put to her.” 16.He later stated: “... bear in mind ... that this evidence was read to you. The allegation is completely denied ... you must take that into account when considering her evidence.” “... bear in mind ... that this evidence was read to you. The allegation is completely denied ... you must take that into account when considering her evidence.” 17.When referring to the evidence of S.T.’s friends, the trial judge reminded the jury that there was an inconsistency between S.T.’s account of the consultation and the account given by S.H. (in her statement S.T. said that the applicant had touched her face and mouth; S.H. gave evidence that it was S.T. herself and not the first applicant who had touched her face and mouth). The trial judge continued: “It is for you to decide the extent to which the evidence of [B.F.] and [S.H.] helps you in deciding whether or not [S.T.] has spoken the truth in her statement. But bear in mind the evidence as to what [S.T.] said to [B.F.] and [S.H.] is not independent evidence as to the truth of her allegations.” “It is for you to decide the extent to which the evidence of [B.F.] and [S.H.] helps you in deciding whether or not [S.T.] has spoken the truth in her statement. But bear in mind the evidence as to what [S.T.] said to [B.F.] and [S.H.] is not independent evidence as to the truth of her allegations.” 18.The trial judge also instructed the jury that they were entitled to consider the evidence of V.U., and of the other two women who had given evidence as to the improper suggestions made by the first applicant, when deciding whether S.T.’s statement was true. However, the jury firstly had to discount the possibility of collusion between the four women. Secondly, they had to ask themselves whether it was reasonable that four people independently making similar accusations could all either be lying or mistaken or have all suffered similar hallucinations or false memory. If the jury thought that incredible, they could be satisfied that S.T. and V.U. had spoken the truth. The trial judge also directed the jury that the greater the similarity between the allegations, the greater the likelihood that the four women were telling the truth. He added that the jury also had to consider whether the women could have consciously or unconsciously been influenced by hearing of the complaints of the others. 19.In the course of their deliberations, on two occasions the jury asked for clarification of points raised in the statement of S.T. On 30 November 2004, the first applicant was convicted by a unanimous verdict of the jury on both counts of indecent assault. He was sentenced to a fifteen-month custodial sentence on the first count and a twelve-month custodial sentence on the second count, to run consecutively. 20.The first applicant appealed against his conviction to the Court of Appeal. The appeal centred on the pre-trial ruling to admit S.T.’s statement as evidence. It was also submitted that, in his summing up, the trial judge did not give adequate directions to the jury as to the consequential disadvantage of this evidence to the first applicant. 21.The appeal was heard and dismissed on 6 September 2005. In its written judgment handed down on 3 November 2005 the Court of Appeal concluded that the first applicant’s right to a fair trial had not been infringed. With regard to the admission in evidence of the statement of S.T., the court held that it was not necessarily incompatible with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention. Relying on Doorson v. the Netherlands (26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II), the court held that the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter of domestic law. It then found: “25.The important factors in the present case are the following. The witness, S.T., could not be examined on behalf of the [first applicant] because she had died. She was the only witness whose evidence went directly to the commission of an indecent assault on her by the appellant. If her statement had been excluded, the prosecution would have had to abandon the first count. The [applicant] was able to attack the accuracy of [S.T.’s] statement by exploring the inconsistencies between it and the witnesses, [B.F.] and [S.H.], and through the expert evidence relating to ‘altered perception’ under hypnosis. The relevant sections of the 1988 Act [see paragraph 41 below] contained provisions designed to protect defendants, which were properly considered by the judge, before the statement was admitted in evidence. Lastly, the tribunal of fact, here the jury, could and should take proper account of the difficulties which the admission of a statement might provide for the [applicant], which should be provided by an appropriate direction to the jury. 26.Where a witness who is the sole witness of a crime has made a statement to be used in its prosecution and has since died, there may be a strong public interest in the admission of the statement in evidence so that the prosecution may proceed. That was the case here. That public interest must not be allowed to override the requirement that the defendant have a fair trial. Like the court in Sellick [see paragraph 48 below] we do not consider that the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights requires the conclusion that in such circumstances the trial will be unfair. The provision in Article 6 § 3 (d) that a person charged shall be able to [have] the witnesses against him examined is one specific aspect of a fair trial: but if the opportunity is not provided, the question is ‘whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way the evidence was taken, were fair’ – Doorson, paragraph 19 [see paragraph 58 below]. This was not a case where the witness had absented himself, whether through fear or otherwise, or had required anonymity, or had exercised a right to keep silent. The reason was death, which has a finality which brings in considerations of its own, as has been indicated at the start of this paragraph.” 26.Where a witness who is the sole witness of a crime has made a statement to be used in its prosecution and has since died, there may be a strong public interest in the admission of the statement in evidence so that the prosecution may proceed.

The reason was death, which has a finality which brings in considerations of its own, as has been indicated at the start of this paragraph.” 22.Turning to the issue of the trial judge’s summing up, the court stated: “We consider that it would have been better if the judge had stated explicitly that the [first applicant] was potentially disadvantaged by the absence of [S.T.] and that in consequence of the inability to cross-examine her and of the jury to see her, her evidence should carry less weight with them. Nonetheless, in the circumstances of this case it must have been wholly clear to the jury from the directions the judge did give, that this was the purpose of his remarks. We therefore consider that the jury were given an adequate direction as to the consequences of [S.T.’s] statement being in evidence in her absence, and that this is not a factor which might make the [first applicant’s] trial unfair and in breach of Article 6. We should also say that overall the evidence against the [first applicant] was very strong. We were wholly unpersuaded that the verdicts were unsafe.” 23.The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords but certified that a point of law of general public importance was involved in the decision. 24.On 30 November 2005 the first applicant petitioned the House of Lords on the point of law certified by the Court of Appeal. On 7 February 2006 the House of Lords refused the petition. 25.The second applicant was born in 1975. His application arises from his conviction for wounding with intent. The background to that conviction is as follows. 26.On 19 May 2004, S., a member of the Iranian community living in London, was involved in an altercation with some Kurdish men. The second applicant interposed himself between S. and the Kurdish men in order to protect S. In the small hours of the morning of 20 May 2004, S. and the second applicant met again outside an Iranian restaurant in Hammersmith, . The second applicant asked S to have a word with him and led him into a nearby alleyway. The men began discussing the earlier altercation. Although S. denied throwing the first punch, he conceded while giving evidence at the second applicant’s trial that he had punched the second applicant. In the fight, the second applicant pushed S. back and, at this stage, S. became aware of a burning sensation in his back, which proved to be the result of three stab wounds to his back. S. and the second applicant had been face-to-face and S.’s account was that he neither saw the second applicant stab him, nor was he aware of the second applicant going behind him or reaching round his back, so as to stab him. 27.During the fight other men were present, including the Kurdish men from the earlier altercation. A friend of S., another member of the Iranian community called T., was there, as were two of T.’s friends and the second applicant’s uncle. S could not say which of the men were behind him. 28.S. saw a knife lying on the ground and he realised that he had been stabbed. In his evidence at the second applicant’s trial (see paragraph 32 below), he stated that he went to pick it up but that either the second applicant or T. had picked it up and thrown it towards the restaurant. S. assumed that it had been the second applicant who had stabbed him. According to S., the second applicant immediately denied this. He told S. to sit down beside him and attempted to staunch the blood flow from S.’s wounds until an ambulance arrived; when it did, he accompanied S to the hospital. At the hospital, the second applicant told the police that he had seen two black men stab S. 29.When witnesses were questioned at the scene, no one claimed to have seen the second applicant stab S. Two days later, however, T. made a statement to the police that he had seen the second applicant stab S. In his statement, T. recounted that, when the second applicant and S. had begun fighting in the alleyway, T. had tried to separate them. He then saw the second applicant hold S. by the neck, hold up the knife and stab S. twice in the back. As T. moved towards the second applicant, the second applicant tried to stab T. in the neck. According to T., the second applicant then dropped the knife and shouted “don’t tell the police”. 29.When witnesses were questioned at the scene, no one claimed to have seen the second applicant stab S. Two days later, however, T. made a statement to the police that he had seen the second applicant stab S. In his statement, T. recounted that, when the second applicant and S. had begun fighting in the alleyway, T. had tried to separate them. He then saw the second applicant hold S. by the neck, hold up the knife and stab S. twice in the back. As T. moved towards the second applicant, the second applicant tried to stab T. in the neck. According to T., the second applicant then dropped the knife and shouted “don’t tell the police”. 30.On 3 November 2004 the second applicant was arrested and taken to Hammersmith police station. In interview, he denied stabbing S. and again stated that two black men were responsible. He was charged with wounding with intent and also with attempting to pervert the course of justice for telling the police, at the hospital and at the police station, that he had seen two black men stab S. 31.On 25 April 2005 the second applicant’s trial began at Blackfriars Crown Court. That day, he pleaded guilty in respect of the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice but maintained his not guilty plea in respect of the charge of wounding with intent. 31.On 25 April 2005 the second applicant’s trial began at Blackfriars Crown Court. That day, he pleaded guilty in respect of the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice but maintained his not guilty plea in respect of the charge of wounding with intent. 32.S. gave evidence for the prosecution. He recounted how he and the second applicant had fought in the alleyway. After a minute he realised that he had been injured in the back. He had not seen who stabbed him. The second applicant had made him sit down and had covered the wound. S. had asked the second applicant who had stabbed him and the second applicant had denied that it was him. When cross-examined, S. accepted that he had not seen the second applicant go behind him and that they had been face-to-face. He also testified that he had heard someone shout to him “Tell him it was the blacks”; the voice did not belong to the second applicant. 33.After S had given evidence, the prosecution made an application for leave to read T.’s statement pursuant to section 116(2)(e) and (4) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”; see paragraphs 43-45 below). The prosecution argued under the 2003 Act that T. was too fearful to attend trial before the jury and that he should qualify for special measures. The trial judge heard evidence from a police officer conducting the case who testified that the Iranian community was close-knit and that T.’s fear was genuine. T.also gave evidence to the trial judge (but not the jury) from behind a screen. He told the judge that he was in fear for himself and his family because of visits and telephone calls he had received, none of which were said to have been from the second applicant. He did not say who had been responsible for the visits and telephone calls. 34.In ruling that leave should be given for the statement to be read to the jury, the trial judge stated: “I am satisfied in those circumstances upon the criminal standard of proof that this witness is genuinely in fear; and I base that not only on his oral testimony, but also upon my opportunity while he was in the witness box to observe him. I therefore have to go on to consider the questions posed in [section 116(4) of the 2003 Act]. Subsection 4(a) requires me to look at the statement’s contents. I have done so. It is submitted by the defence that they may be unreliable; there being some inconsistencies with the evidence that was given by [S.]. There will always be cases, whether it be oral evidence or evidence that is read, where there are inconsistencies. It is always for the jury to come to a conclusion, based upon submissions of counsel and the evidence that they have heard, as to whether the evidence is reliable or not. And they will receive from me the appropriate warning when the time comes as to how they should view that statement. It is further submitted that in looking at the statement, it is a statement of great importance; in that it is from a person who purports to witness the incident and consequently goes to the heart of the matter. In my view, it is precisely this type of witness who is likely to be put in fear, and consequently that must have been what Parliament had in mind when it enacted this particular section. I therefore have to look, having looked at the contents of the statement, to any risk its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to any party to the proceedings. I am satisfied that there would be an unfairness caused by its exclusion; but I am equally satisfied that no unfairness would be caused by its admission. And in doing so, I have taken into account the words of [the 2003 Act]; in particular how difficult it will be to challenge the statement if the relevant person does not give oral evidence. Challenge of a statement does not always come from cross-examination. Challenge of a statement can be caused by evidence given in rebuttal; by either the defendant, if he chooses to do so, or by any other bystander – and we know that there were some – who were on the street at that time. Consequently I am satisfied that the defendant’s evidence, if he chooses to give it, would be sufficient to rebut and to challenge the evidence that is contained in that statement. I have further considered other relevant factors, and I have also offered to the witness whilst he was in the witness box behind screens the possibility of him giving evidence with the same special measures in place. He told me his position would not change; that he could not give evidence before a jury, and the reason that he could not was because he was in fear. Having taken all those matters into account in those circumstances, I am satisfied that this is the type of case which Parliament envisaged might require a statement to be read.” 35.T.’s witness statement was then read to the jury. Evidence was also given by the doctor who had treated S. at hospital as to the nature of the wound and by a forensic scientist who had tested the blood found on the second applicant’s clothes and confirmed it matched that of S. (though no firm conclusions could be drawn as to how it had been deposited on the clothes). The record of the second applicant’s interview by the police was also tendered by the prosecution (see paragraph 30 above). 36.The second applicant gave evidence in his defence. He stated that he had been present at the earlier altercation with the Kurdish men. When he and S. later met outside the restaurant, he had taken S. by the hand and suggested that they go and talk, but S. had begun to punch him. He had defended himself by grabbing S. by the collar and pushing him. T. had then tried to intervene and a number of other members of the Iranian community had restrained S. T. had been standing between S. and the second applicant and, at this stage, the second applicant noticed the knife on the ground. He had picked it up and thrown it, not knowing at this point that S. had been stabbed. When S blamed him for the stabbing, the second applicant had told him to sit down and had successfully calmed him down. He placed his hand on the wound on S.’s back. S. then appeared to accept that the second applicant had not stabbed him. The second applicant also gave evidence that he had told the police that two black men were responsible because this was what his uncle had told him to say. Finally, the second applicant gave evidence that, before he had been interviewed by the police, T. had told him that he, T., knew that the second applicant had not stabbed S. 36.The second applicant gave evidence in his defence.

Finally, the second applicant gave evidence that, before he had been interviewed by the police, T. had told him that he, T., knew that the second applicant had not stabbed S. 37.The judge, in his summing up, warned the jury about the danger of relying on the evidence of T. He stated: “That evidence, as you know, was read to you under the provisions that allow a witness who is frightened, it is not a question of nerves it is a question of fright, fear, for his statement to be read to you but you must be careful as to how you treat it. It is right, as has been pointed out by the defence, that they were deprived of an opportunity to test that evidence under cross-examination. It is right also that you did not have the advantage of seeing the witness and his demeanour in court. You did not have the opportunity for him to think back and say ‘possibly because of things I saw I put two and two together and made five’, as counsel for the defence invites you to say. In other words, you must always be alert to [the fact] that he could put things that he did see together and come to the wrong conclusion. That is a way of examining the statement. You must ask yourselves ‘can we rely upon this statement? Is it a statement which we find convincing?’ It is only, if you are satisfied so that you are sure, that what is in the statement has accurately depicted what happened that night and what the witness saw, that you could rely upon it. That goes for any witness. It is only if you find that the evidence is compelling and satisfies you, so that you are sure, that you act upon it. So you must always ask yourselves ‘is the statement he made reliable?’ You must bear in mind also, importantly, that it is agreed and acknowledged that it is not the defendant who is responsible for putting the witness in fear.” 38.On 29 April 2005 the second applicant was convicted by a majority verdict of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, for which he was later sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with a term of fifteen months’ imprisonment for the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice to which he had pleaded guilty. 39.The second applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the inability to cross-examine T. infringed his right to a fair trial. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the Crown accepted that T.’s statement was “both important and probative of a major issue in the case ... had it not been admitted the prospect of a conviction would have receded and that of an acquittal advanced”. The court upheld the reasoning of the trial judge, stating that there was available not only cross-examination of other prosecution witnesses but also evidence from the second applicant himself and the potential for evidence from other bystanders in order to prevent unfairness. It was also stated that the trial judge had explicitly warned the jury in detail as to how they should treat this evidence and properly directed them as to how they should consider it in reaching their verdict. Although the second applicant maintained that even a proper direction by the judge could not cure the unfairness, the Court of Appeal held that the jury was informed of all matters necessary to its decision-making process. Leave to appeal on conviction was refused on 24 January 2006. The Court of Appeal did, however, give the second applicant leave to appeal against his sentence and reduced the sentence of nine years’ imprisonment to seven years’ imprisonment. 40.Hearsay evidence is any statement of fact other than one made, of his own knowledge, by a witness in the course of oral testimony (see paragraph20 of the judgment of Lord Phillips in R. v. Horncastle and others, summarised at paragraphs 57 to 62 below). As a general rule it is inadmissible in a criminal case unless there is a common-law rule or statutory provision which allows for its admission. The relevant statutory provisions applicable to each applicant are set in the following section. Those statutory provisions are supplemented by three common-law principles. Firstly, there is an additional discretion at common law for a trial judge to exclude any evidence if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. This, in turn, is supplemented by section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which provides the court with a discretion to exclude evidence if its admission would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the trial that it ought not to be admitted. Secondly, if hearsay evidence is admitted and the jury have heard it, the trial judge, in his summing up, must direct the jury as to the dangers of relying on hearsay evidence. Thirdly, in a jury trial, the jury must receive the traditional direction as to the burden of proof, namely that they must be satisfied of the defendant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.>Primary legislation applicable in Mr Al-Khawaja’s case 41.At the time of the first applicant’s trial, the relevant statutory provisions were to be found in sections 23 to 28 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”). Section 23 of the 1988 Act provides for the admission of first-hand documentary hearsay in a criminal trial: “23. ... a statement made by a person in a document shall be admissible in criminal proceedings as evidence of any fact of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible if— (2)... (a)... the person who made the statement is dead or by reason of his bodily or mental condition unfit to attend as a witness; ... 25.(1)If, having regard to all the circumstances— (a)the Crown Court— (i)on a trial on indictment; (ii)on an appeal from a magistrates’ court; or (iii)on the hearing of an application under section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 (applications for dismissal of charges of fraud transferred from magistrates’ court to Crown Court); or (b)the criminal division of the Court of Appeal; or (c)a magistrates’ court on a trial of an information, is of the opinion that in the interests of justice a statement which is admissible by virtue of section 23 or 24 above nevertheless ought not to be admitted, it may direct that the statement shall not be admitted. (2)Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) above, it shall be the duty of the court to have regard— (a)to the nature and source of the document containing the statement and to whether or not, having regard to its nature and source and to any other circumstances that appear to the court to be relevant, it is likely that the document is authentic; (b)to the extent to which the statement appears to supply evidence which would otherwise not be readily available; (c)to the relevance of the evidence that it appears to supply to any issue which is likely to have to be determined in the proceedings; and (d)to any risk, having regard in particular to whether it is likely to be possible to controvert the statement if the person making it does not attend to give oral evidence in the proceedings, that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to the accused or, if there is more than one, to any of them. 26.Where a statement which is admissible in criminal proceedings by virtue of section 23 or 24 above appears to the court to have been prepared ..., for the purposes— (a)of pending or contemplated criminal proceedings; or (b)of a criminal investigation, the statement shall not be given in evidence in any criminal proceedings without the leave of the court, and the court shall not give leave unless it is of the opinion that the statement ought to be admitted in the interests of justice; and in considering whether its admission would be in the interests of justice, it shall be the duty of the court to have regard— (i)to the contents of the statement; (ii)to any risk, having regard in particular to whether it is likely to be possible to controvert the statement if the person making it does not attend to give oral evidence in the proceedings, that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to the accused or, if there is more than one, to any of them; and (iii)to any other circumstances that appear to the court to be relevant ...” Schedule 2 to the Act allows for the admission of evidence relating to the credibility and consistency of the maker of the statement, where such evidence would have been admissible had he or she given evidence in person, or where the matter could have been put to him or her in cross-examination. The Schedule also provides that, in estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to such a statement regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to its accuracy or otherwise.>Primary legislation applicable in Mr Tahery’s case (a)The Law Commission’s report 42.In its report of April 1997, entitled “Evidence in Criminal Proceedings: Hearsay and Related Topics”, the Law Commission recommended a series of reforms to the law of hearsay in England and Wales, including the provisions contained in the 1988 Act. In addition to recommending clarification of the conditions under which a witness statement could be admitted at trial (including the existing grounds of death and fear), the Commission proposed that there should be a limited discretion to admit hearsay evidence that did not fall within any other statutory or common-law exception (recommendation 28). In its earlier consultation paper, published in January 1995, the Commission had reviewed the case-law of this Court on Article 6 § 3 (d) and concluded that there was a risk of a breach of the Convention where a person stood to be convicted on hearsay evidence alone. The Commission considered that this risk was sufficiently serious to warrant requiring the trial court to stop the case where hearsay is the only evidence of an element of the offence (paragraph 9.5 of the consultation paper). After criticisms of this proposal (principally that it was unduly cautious and was beset with practical difficulties), in its 1997 report the Commission decided not to maintain its proposal (see paragraphs 5.33-5.41 of the report). It concluded instead that the adequate protection would be provided by the safeguards it proposed, in particular its recommendation 47, which proposed giving the trial judge the power to stop a case if hearsay evidence was unconvincing (see paragraph 45 below). (b)The Criminal Justice Act 2003 (b)The Criminal Justice Act 2003 43.Part 11, Chapter 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”) came into force in April 2005. It was intended to reform substantially the law governing the admission of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings on the basis of the draft bill proposed by the Law Commission. Under section 114 of the 2003 Act, hearsay evidence is only admissible in criminal proceedings if one of a number of “gateways” applies. Although it was not relied upon in the second applicant’s case, one such “gateway” is section 114(1)(d) which allows for the admission of hearsay evidence if the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice for it to be admissible. Section114(2) provides: “In deciding whether a statement not made in oral evidence should be admitted under subsection (1)(d), the court must have regard to the following factors (and to any others it considers relevant)— (a)how much probative value the statement has (assuming it to be true) in relation to a matter in issue in the proceedings, or how valuable it is for the understanding of other evidence in the case; (b)what other evidence has been, or can be, given on the matter or evidence mentioned in paragraph (a); (c)how important the matter or evidence mentioned in paragraph (a) is in the context of the case as a whole; (d)the circumstances in which the statement was made; (e)how reliable the maker of the statement appears to be; (f)how reliable the evidence of the making of the statement appears to be; (g)whether oral evidence of the matter stated can be given and, if not, why it cannot; (h)the amount of difficulty involved in challenging the statement; (i)the extent to which that difficulty would be likely to prejudice the party facing it.” (i)the extent to which that difficulty would be likely to prejudice the party facing it.” 44.The “gateway” relied on in the second applicant’s case was section116, which allows for the admission of statements of absent witnesses. Section 116, where relevant, provides: “(1)In criminal proceedings a statement not made in oral evidence in the proceedings is admissible as evidence of any matter stated if— (a)oral evidence given in the proceedings by the person who made the statement would be admissible as evidence of that matter; (b)the person who made the statement (the relevant person) is identified to the court’s satisfaction; and (c)any of the five conditions mentioned in subsection (2) is satisfied. (2)The conditions are— (a)that the relevant person is dead; (b)that the relevant person is unfit to be a witness because of his bodily or mental condition; (c)that the relevant person is outside the and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance; (d)that the relevant person cannot be found although such steps as it is reasonably practicable to take to find him have been taken; (e)that through fear the relevant person does not give (or does not continue to give) oral evidence in the proceedings, either at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement, and the court gives leave for the statement to be given in evidence. (3)For the purposes of subsection (2)(e) ‘fear’ is to be widely construed and (for example) includes fear of the death or injury of another person or of financial loss. (4)Leave may be given under subsection (2)(e) only if the court considers that the statement ought to be admitted in the interests of justice, having regard— (a)to the statement’s contents; (b)to any risk that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to any party to the proceedings (and in particular to how difficult it will be to challenge the statement if the relevant person does not give oral evidence); (c)in appropriate cases, to the fact that a direction under section 19 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 (c. 23) (special measures for the giving of evidence by fearful witnesses etc.) could be made in relation to the relevant person; and (d)to any other relevant circumstances. (5)A condition set out in any paragraph of subsection (2) which is in fact satisfied is to be treated as not satisfied if it is shown that the circumstances described in that paragraph are caused— (a)by the person in support of whose case it is sought to give the statement in evidence; or (b)by a person acting on his behalf; in order to prevent the relevant person giving oral evidence in the proceedings (whether at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement).” in order to prevent the relevant person giving oral evidence in the proceedings (whether at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement).” 45.By section 121 of the 2003 Act, section 116(2)(e) can only be relied upon in respect of first-hand hearsay; it cannot be relied only to allow the admission of multiple hearsay. In addition, section 124 allows the admission of evidence to challenge the credibility of the absent witness, for example through the admission of evidence of his bad character, including previous convictions, a propensity to be untruthful and so on. It also allows the admission of inconsistent statements that the witness has made. Section 124(2) allows the admission of evidence to challenge the credibility of the absent witness in circumstances where it would not be admissible in respect of a live witness, for example when it relates to a collateral issue in the case. Where a case is based wholly or partly on hearsay evidence, section 125 requires the trial judge to stop the case (and either direct an acquittal or discharge the jury) if, considering its importance to the case against the defendant, the hearsay evidence is so unconvincing that a conviction would be unsafe. This enacted the Law Commission’s recommendation 47 (see paragraph 42 above). Section 126 preserves both the common-law discretion and the section 78 discretion of the trial judge to exclude hearsay evidence (see paragraph 40 above). It also provides a statutory discretion to exclude hearsay evidence if the trial judge is satisfied that “the case for excluding it, taking account of the danger that to admit it would result in undue waste of time, substantially outweighs the case for admitting it, taking account of the value of the evidence”.>The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 46.The conditions under which witnesses can give evidence anonymously in criminal proceedings are now regulated by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (“the 2009 Act”). Formerly, this was regulated by similar provisions in the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008, which was enacted following the House of Lords’ judgment in R. v. Davis (see paragraphs 49 and 50 below). Under the 2009 Act, witnesses can only give evidence anonymously when, upon the application of either the prosecution or a defendant in the proceedings, the trial judge makes a “witness anonymity order”. Section 87 requires that the trial judge be informed of the identity of the witness. Sections 88(2)-(6) and 89 lay down the conditions for the making of a witness anonymity order. In deciding whether those conditions are met, the court must have regard, inter alia, to whether evidence given by the witness might be the sole or decisive evidence implicating the defendant (section 89(2)(c)). 47.Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen. Section 6(1) provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.>R. v. Sellick and Sellick 48.This Court’s judgment in Lucà v. Italy (no. 33354/96, § 40, ECHR 2001II) was considered by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Sellick and Sellick [2005] EWCA Crim 651, which concerned two defendants who were alleged to have intimidated witnesses. Leave was given by the trial judge to have the witnesses’ statements read to the jury. The defendants appealed on the ground that the admission of the statements breached Article 6 § 1 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d). The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. In considering the relevant case-law of this Court, at paragraph 50 of its judgment, it stated that what appeared from that case-law were the following propositions: “(i)The admissibility of evidence is primarily for the national law; (ii)Evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing and as a general rule Article [6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] require a defendant to be given a proper and adequate opportunity to challenge and question witnesses; (iii)It is not necessarily incompatible with Article [6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] for depositions to be read and that can be so even if there has been no opportunity to question the witness at any stage of the proceedings. Article [6 § 3 (d)] is simply an illustration of matters to be taken into account in considering whether a fair trial has been held. The reasons for the court holding it necessary that statements should be read and the procedures to counterbalance any handicap to the defence will all be relevant to the issue, whether, where statements have been read, the trial was fair; (iv)The quality of the evidence and its inherent reliability, plus the degree of caution exercised in relation to reliance on it, will also be relevant to the question whether the trial was fair.” The Court of Appeal then stated: “The question is whether there is a fifth proposition to the effect that where the circumstances justify the reading of the statement where the defendant has had no opportunity to question the witness at any stage of the trial process, the statement must not be allowed to be read if it is the sole or decisive evidence against the defendant. Certainly at first sight paragraph 40 of Lucà seems to suggest that in whatever circumstances and whatever counterbalancing factors are present if statements are read then there will be a breach of Article 6, if the statements are the sole or decisive evidence. Furthermore there is some support for that position in the previous authorities. But neither Lucà nor any of the other authorities were concerned with a case where a witness, whose identity was well-known to a defendant, was being kept away by fear, although we must accept that the reference to Mafia-type organisations and the trials thereof in paragraph 40 shows that the court had extreme circumstances in mind.”>R. v.>R. v. 49.In R. v. Davis [2008] UKHL 36, the House of Lords considered an appeal against conviction by a defendant who had been convicted of two counts of murder by shooting. Three witnesses had given evidence at trial identifying the defendant as the gunman. They gave evidence anonymously, testifying behind a screen so that they could be seen by the judge and jury but not the defendant. The House of Lords unanimously allowed the defendant’s appeal. It found that the witnesses’ testimony was inconsistent with the long-established principle of the English common law that, subject to certain exceptions and statutory qualifications, the defendant in a criminal trial should be confronted by his accusers in order that he may cross-examine them and challenge their evidence, a principle which originated in ancient (Lord Bingham at paragraph 5). Moreover, this Court had not set its face absolutely against the admission of anonymous evidence in all circumstances. However, it had said that a conviction should not be based solely or to a decisive extent on anonymous statements. In any event, on the facts in Davis’s case, this Court would have found a violation of Article 6: not only was the anonymous witnesses’ evidence the sole or decisive basis on which Davis had been convicted, but effective cross-examination had been hampered. Moreover, this Court had not set its face absolutely against the admission of anonymous evidence in all circumstances. However, it had said that a conviction should not be based solely or to a decisive extent on anonymous statements. In any event, on the facts in Davis’s case, this Court would have found a violation of Article 6: not only was the anonymous witnesses’ evidence the sole or decisive basis on which Davis had been convicted, but effective cross-examination had been hampered. 50.Lord Mance, concurring in judgment, considered the relevant authorities of this Court on Article 6. Having done so, he doubted that there was an absolute requirement that anonymous testimony should not be the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant. Instead, the extent to which such testimony is decisive might be no more than a very important factor to balance in the scales. He also considered that R. v. Sellick and Sellick (among other authorities) served as a caution against treating the Convention, or apparently general statements by this Court, as containing absolutely inflexible rules. 51.The Chamber judgment of 20 January 2009 in the present cases was considered by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in R. v. Horncastle and others. The case concerned the appeals of four defendants who had been convicted on the basis of statements of absent victims, which were read at trial under section 116 of the 2003 Act. For two of the defendants, the maker of the statement had died. For another two, the witness was too fearful to attend trial. Their appeals were heard together with that of a fifth defendant, Carter, who had been convicted on the basis of business records, which were introduced at his trial. 52.On 22 May 2009 the Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appeals of the first four defendants ([2009] EWCA Crim 964). It accepted that Article 6 § 3 (d) had a content of its own but, given that it did not create any absolute right to have every witness examined, the balance struck by the 2003 Act was legitimate and wholly consistent with the Convention. There could be a very real disadvantage in admitting hearsay evidence and it needed cautious handling. However, having regard to the safeguards contained in the 2003 Act, which were rigorously applied, there would be no violation of Article 6 if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive degree on hearsay evidence. Where the hearsay evidence was demonstrably reliable, or its reliability could properly be tested and assessed, the rights of the defence would be respected, there would be sufficient counterbalancing measures and the trial would be fair. It was not appropriate that there should be a rule that counterbalancing measures could never be sufficient where the evidence was sole or decisive. This had been considered and rejected by the Law Commission and Parliament when it enacted the 2003 Act. 52.On 22 May 2009 the Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appeals of the first four defendants ([2009] EWCA Crim 964).

This had been considered and rejected by the Law Commission and Parliament when it enacted the 2003 Act. 53.There were also principled and practical difficulties with a sole or decisive rule. Firstly, as a principled difficulty, the test assumed that all hearsay evidence was unreliable in the absence of testing in open court, and secondly, it further assumed that the fact-finder (such as the jury) could not be trusted to assess the weight of the evidence. Neither assumption was justified. For the first, the Court of Appeal gave examples of hearsay evidence that would be reliable such as a victim who, before dying, revealed the name of his or her murderer. For the second, the Court of Appeal found that juries were perfectly able to understand the limitations of written statements and, under section 124 of the 2003 Act, would be provided with material about the maker of the statement (see paragraph 45 above). The mere fact that the evidence was an essential link in the chain of evidence against the accused did not alter that conclusion. For example, forensic evidence might depend on work done by unidentified laboratory assistants (and to that extent was hearsay). However, it was not necessary for every member of the laboratory who had worked with the evidence to be called in order for the strength of the evidence to be tested. 53.There were also principled and practical difficulties with a sole or decisive rule.

However, it was not necessary for every member of the laboratory who had worked with the evidence to be called in order for the strength of the evidence to be tested. 54.The court also found that there were practical difficulties with the sole or decisive rule as a test of admissibility of evidence. It observed: “It is clear from the judgment in Al-Khawaja [v. the United Kingdom] that the [European Court of Human Rights] took the view that the error had lain in admitting the hearsay evidence: see in particular paragraphs 37, 40, 42 and 46. Any test of admissibility must be one which can be applied in advance of the giving of the evidence, let alone of the outcome of the trial. A routine test of admissibility of evidence which can only be applied in retrospect, after the outcome of the trial is known, makes the trial process little more than speculative. Judge, jury, witnesses and parties may find themselves engaged in shadow-boxing without knowing whether the solemn result of the trial will stand to be reversed on the grounds that, as things have turned out, the test of admissibility was not met. Nor can any defendant decide how to conduct his case, and indeed whether or not to plead guilty, if he does not know what evidence can and cannot be relied upon. It will no doubt often be possible to identify in advance a case in which the hearsay evidence in question is the sole evidence against the accused. An obvious case is that of the single eyewitness case, with no suggested support from any other source. But this frequently may not be clear from the outset; there may be other evidence which the prosecution intends to present, but which, on hearing, turns out not to incriminate the accused, or is effectively demolished. Conversely, what appears at the outset to be hearsay evidence standing alone may sometimes come to be supported by other material as the evidence develops. A witness may add something of great significance not previously mentioned, or the significance of something always said may become apparent when apparently unconnected other evidence is given. In any case where there is more than one accused jointly charged, it is common experience that the evidence of one may well shed enormous light upon the guilt or innocence of another. So even the concept of ‘sole’ evidence is an impractical test for admissibility. It is, however, the second limb of the suggested test which is apt to cause the greatest difficulty. No one can know what evidence is decisive until the decisionmaking process is over. On no view can it be possible to rule in advance, at the stage when admissibility is in question, which evidence will be decisive ... The application of the test is made the more difficult yet if the meaning of ‘decisive’ is extended to encompass any evidence of which it can be said that, if it were absent, ‘the prospect of a conviction would have receded and that of an acquittal advanced’ (see paragraph 21 of Al-Khawaja). Indeed, if that is the test of what is decisive, virtually all evidence would qualify; evidence which does not, if accepted by the jury, advance the prospect of conviction will ordinarily be excluded as irrelevant.” The Court of Appeal also observed that the test would also be impossible to apply at a trial of two or more defendants, where one defendant sought to introduce hearsay evidence for his defence. In such a case, the trial judge would be bound to allow the defendant to introduce that evidence even if it might also incriminate one of the other defendants and indeed be decisive evidence against that other defendant. The Court of Appeal also observed that the test would also be impossible to apply at a trial of two or more defendants, where one defendant sought to introduce hearsay evidence for his defence. In such a case, the trial judge would be bound to allow the defendant to introduce that evidence even if it might also incriminate one of the other defendants and indeed be decisive evidence against that other defendant. 55.The Court of Appeal also considered that the safeguard in section125 of the 2003 Act (the power of a trial judge to stop the case if the hearsay evidence is unconvincing; see paragraph 45 above) provided for a “proportionate assessment of the reliability” of hearsay evidence and it would not serve justice if that power were to be trammelled by a requirement that it be exercised in every case in which the hearsay evidence were the sole or decisive evidence. Sole or decisive hearsay could be wholly convincing and, equally, evidence which was neither sole nor decisive might have such a potential influence on the jury that the judge would be persuaded that a conviction was unsafe. Where there was a legitimate argument that that hearsay was unconvincing and important to the case, the trial judge was required to make up his own mind as to whether a conviction would be safe; this involved assessing the reliability of the hearsay evidence, its place in the evidence as a whole, the issues in the case as they had emerged, and all the other individual circumstances of the case. Finally, the other safeguards contained in the 2003 Act were rigorously applied and the difficulties faced by defendants when hearsay was admitted were well understood by the courts. The Act did not equate hearsay with first-hand evidence; on the contrary it required cautious handling. 55.The Court of Appeal also considered that the safeguard in section125 of the 2003 Act (the power of a trial judge to stop the case if the hearsay evidence is unconvincing; see paragraph 45 above) provided for a “proportionate assessment of the reliability” of hearsay evidence and it would not serve justice if that power were to be trammelled by a requirement that it be exercised in every case in which the hearsay evidence were the sole or decisive evidence.

Finally, the other safeguards contained in the 2003 Act were rigorously applied and the difficulties faced by defendants when hearsay was admitted were well understood by the courts. The Act did not equate hearsay with first-hand evidence; on the contrary it required cautious handling. 56.The Court of Appeal also gave guidance as to assessing when it would be appropriate to allow hearsay evidence to be introduced because a witness was in fear. There was, in the case-law of this Court, no requirement that the fear had to be attributable to the defendant, and the essential questions were whether there was a justifiable reason for the absence of the witness supported by evidence and whether the evidence was demonstrably reliable or its reliability could be properly tested and assessed. The Court of Appeal added: “It is, however, important that all possible efforts are made to get the witness to court. As is clear, the right to confrontation is a long-standing requirement of the common law and recognised in Article 6 [§ 3 (d)]. It is only to be departed from in the limited circumstances and under the conditions set out in the [2003 Act]. The witness must be given all possible support, but also made to understand the importance of the citizen’s duty, and indeed that the violent and intimidatory will only flourish the more if that duty is not done, whilst they will normally back down in the face of determination that it be performed. For this reason it is of especial importance that assurances are never given to potential witnesses that their evidence will be read. Unless the defendant consents, it is only the court applying the strict conditions of the [2003 Act] based on evidence that can admit such a statement. Any indication, let alone an assurance, can only give rise to an expectation that this will indeed happen, when if it does the impact of the evidence will be diminished and the disadvantage to the accused may result in it not being given at all. It may well be that in the early stage of police enquiries into a prominent crime the investigators need to seek out information on a confidential basis: that is a matter for practical policing and not for us. But no person who is becoming not simply a source of information but a witness should be told that his evidence will be read, or indeed given any indication whatsoever that this is likely. The most that he can be told is that witnesses are expected to be seen at court, that any departure from that principle is exceptional, and that the decision whether to depart from it is one for the judge and not for the police. In the case before us of Marquis and Graham [two of the appellants], as we set out at paragraphs 127 and 132, the judge found that the investigating police officer had significantly contributed to the fear of the witness by referring repeatedly to a notorious local example of witnesses being hunted down, although relocated, and killed. Although notorious, that incident was an extreme and very unusual case. The need for police officers to tender careful advice to potential witnesses in order to discharge their duty of care towards them should not lead to such frightening information being laboured out of defensiveness. Whilst the [2003 Act] requires fear to be construed broadly, it is not to be expected that fear based upon inappropriate assurances by police officers will result in the evidence being read and the case proceeding on the basis of it to the jury. If the evidence can really only be assessed by the jury by seeing the witness, as will often be the case, it may not be admitted. If it is admitted and central to the case, there is a significant possibility that at the end of the trial the judge may have to rule under [section] 125 that a conviction relying upon it would be unsafe.” (b)The judgment of the Supreme Court 57.On 9 December 2009 the United Kingdom Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment ([2009] UKSC 14). Lord Phillips, giving the judgment of the Supreme Court, found that, although domestic courts were required by the Human Rights Act 1998 to take account of the Strasbourg jurisprudence in applying principles that were clearly established, on rare occasions, where a court was concerned that the Strasbourg judgment did not sufficiently appreciate or accommodate some aspect of English law, it might decline to follow the judgment. The Chamber judgment was such a case. 57.On 9 December 2009 the United Kingdom Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment ([2009] UKSC 14). Lord Phillips, giving the judgment of the Supreme Court, found that, although domestic courts were required by the Human Rights Act 1998 to take account of the Strasbourg jurisprudence in applying principles that were clearly established, on rare occasions, where a court was concerned that the Strasbourg judgment did not sufficiently appreciate or accommodate some aspect of English law, it might decline to follow the judgment. The Chamber judgment was such a case. 58.Lord Phillips considered that a defendant should not be immune from conviction where a witness, who had given critical and apparently reliable evidence in a statement, was unavailable to give evidence at trial through death or some other reason. In analysing the relevant case-law of this Court on Article 6 § 3 (d), Lord Phillips concluded that, although this Court had recognised the need for exceptions to the strict application of Article 6 § 3 (d), the manner in which it approved those exceptions resulted in a jurisprudence which lacked clarity. The sole or decisive rule had been introduced into the Strasbourg case-law in Doorson (cited above) without discussion of the underlying principle or full consideration of whether there was justification for imposing the rule as an overriding principle applicable equally to continental and common-law jurisdictions. Indeed, the rule seemed to have been created because, in contrast to the common law, continental systems of criminal procedure did not have a comparable body of jurisprudence or rules governing the admissibility of evidence. 59.Lord Phillips, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, found that the rule would create severe practical difficulties if applied to English criminal procedure. Firstly, it was not easy to apply because it was not clear what was meant by “decisive”: under English criminal procedure no evidence could be admitted unless it was potentially probative and, in theory, any item of probative evidence could make the difference between conviction and acquittal. Secondly, it would be hard enough to apply that test at first instance but it would be impossible for national appellate courts or this Court to decide whether a particular statement was the sole or decisive basis for a conviction. In a jury trial, the only way the rule could be applied would be to exclude all hearsay evidence. 59.Lord Phillips, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, found that the rule would create severe practical difficulties if applied to English criminal procedure.

In a jury trial, the only way the rule could be applied would be to exclude all hearsay evidence. 60.Lord Phillips also observed: “The sole or decisive test produces a paradox. It permits the court to have regard to evidence if the support that it gives to the prosecution case is peripheral, but not where it is decisive. The more cogent the evidence the less it can be relied upon. There will be many cases where the statement of a witness who cannot be called to testify will not be safe or satisfactory as the basis for a conviction. There will, however, be some cases where the evidence in question is demonstrably reliable. The Court of Appeal has given a number of examples. I will just give one, which is a variant of one of theirs. A visitor to witnesses a hit and run road accident in which a cyclist is killed. He memorises the number of the car, and makes a statement to the police in which he includes not merely the number, but the make and colour of the car and the fact that the driver was a man with a beard. He then returns to his own country, where he is himself killed in a road accident. The police find that the car with the registration number that he provided is the make and colour that he reported and that it is owned by a man with a beard. The owner declines to answer questions as to his whereabouts at the time of the accident. It seems hard to justify a rule that would preclude the conviction of the owner of the car on the basis of the statement of the deceased witness, yet that is the effect of the sole or decisive test.” 61.Lord Phillips instead concluded that the 2003 Act made such a rule unnecessary in English criminal procedure because, if the 2003 Act were observed, there would be no breach of Article 6 § 3 (d) even if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive extent on hearsay evidence. To demonstrate this point, Annex 4 to the judgment analysed a series of cases against other Contracting States where this Court had found a violation of Article 6 § 1 when taken in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d). In each case, had the trial taken place in England and Wales, the witness’s testimony would not have been admissible under the 2003 Act either because the witness was anonymous and absent or because the trial court had not made sufficient enquiries to ensure there was good reason for the witness’s absence. Alternatively, had the evidence been admitted, any conviction would have been quashed on appeal. 61.Lord Phillips instead concluded that the 2003 Act made such a rule unnecessary in English criminal procedure because, if the 2003 Act were observed, there would be no breach of Article 6 § 3 (d) even if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive extent on hearsay evidence.

Alternatively, had the evidence been admitted, any conviction would have been quashed on appeal. 62.Lord Brown delivered a concurring judgment in which he stated: “These appeals are of the utmost importance. If the Strasbourg case-law does indeed establish an inflexible, unqualified principle that any conviction based solely or decisively on evidence adduced from an absent or anonymous witness is necessarily to be condemned as unfair and set aside as contrary to [Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] of the Convention, then the whole domestic scheme for ensuring fair trials – the scheme now enshrined (as to hearsay evidence) in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and (as to anonymous evidence) in the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008 [see paragraph 46 above] – cannot stand and many guilty defendants will have to go free. It is difficult to suppose that the has in fact laid down so absolute a principle as this and, indeed, one exception to it, at least, appears to be acknowledged: the fairness of admitting hearsay evidence from a witness absent as a result of the defendant’s own intimidation. ... Nor can readily be supposed to have intended the sort of practical problems and anomalies identified by the Court of Appeal (paragraphs 61-63 and6871 [of its judgment]) that must inevitably flow from any absolute principle of the kind here contended for. Obviously, the more crucial the evidence is to the proof of guilt, the more scrupulous must the court be to ensure that it can be fairly adduced and is likely to be reliable. In this connection there can be no harm in using the concept of ‘sole or decisive’ so long as it is used broadly – as it is in the 2008 Act with regard to anonymous witnesses and, indeed, in the control order context where it relates rather to the allegations made against the suspect than the evidence adduced in support. Understood and applied inflexibly, however, the concept would involve insoluble problems of detailed interpretation and application. The better view may therefore be that no such absolute principle emerges from the Strasbourg Court’s judgment in Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom ...” 63.Subject to certain statutory exceptions, in Scots criminal law a person cannot be convicted of a crime or statutory offence on the uncorroborated testimony of one witness, however credible (see Morton v. HM Advocate 1938 JC 52, quoted in Campbell v. HM Advocate 2004SLT135). 64.Hearsay is regulated by section 259 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which allows for its admissibility under certain conditions, including when the person who made the statement is dead. Section 259(4) permits evidence to be admitted which is relevant to the credibility of the person as a witness. In N v. HM Advocate 2003 SLT 761 the High Court of Justiciary, sitting as an appeal court, reluctantly reached the conclusion that section 259 deprived the court of the discretion it previously enjoyed at common law to exclude such evidence if it was unreliable. Lord Justice Clerk observed that, notwithstanding section 259, the long-recognised dangers in hearsay evidence remained. He added: “Where a general provision such as [section] 259 applies, there are bound to be cases in the circumstances of which hearsay evidence would be so prejudicial to the fairness of the trial that the only just and proper course would be to exclude it. This, I think, is such a case. I am not impressed by the three safeguards to which the trial judge referred (HMAdvocate v. N, at p. 437C–E). The requirement of corroboration is a neutral consideration. It is a safeguard that applies to prosecution evidence in any form. I cannot see what worthwhile safeguard the principle of corroboration provides if the primary evidence sought to be corroborated is per se unfair to the accused. Moreover, the leading of evidence bearing upon the credibility of the maker of the hearsay statement may be at most an exercise in damage limitation where clearly prejudicial evidence has already been led. As for the safeguard of the judge’s directions, I think that there may be cases where the hearsay evidence is so prejudicial that no direction, however strong, could make adequate amends for the unfairness of its having been admitted. ... In English provisions governing the admissibility of a statement made in a document, Parliament has expressly conferred a discretion on the court to exclude such a statement if it is of the opinion that in the interests of justice it ought not to be admitted. One specific consideration to which the court must have regard is the risk that the admission of the evidence will result in unfairness to the accused (Criminal Justice Act 1988, [sections] 25(1), 25(2)(d) and 26(ii); cf. R. v. Gokal). These, in my view, are prudent provisions. If provisions of this kind had been available to the trial judge in this case, they could have enabled him to exclude the hearsay at the outset.” 65.The High Court of Justiciary also considered the compatibility of the introduction of the evidence of an absent witness with Article 6 § 3 (d) in McKenna v. HM Advocate. In that case, a murder trial, the prosecution sought to introduce statements made to the police by a possible co-accused who had since died. In a previous ruling given before trial (2000 SLT 508), the High Court of Justiciary, sitting as an appeal court, had found that it was only in extreme circumstances that an accused could contend in advance of trial that the introduction of the hearsay evidence would be so prejudicial to the prospects of a fair trial that the court could determine the issue in advance. It therefore allowed the trial to proceed. When the statements were introduced at trial and the accused was convicted, he appealed against his conviction. In its judgment dismissing the appeal (2003 SLT 508), the High Court of Justiciary found that, while the statements were important evidence, having regard to the other evidence led at trial (which included admissions by the accused and forensic evidence), it could not be said that the appellant’s conviction was based to a decisive extent on them. The jury had also been adequately and satisfactorily directed as to how to approach the absent witness’s statement. A similar conclusion was reached by the same court in HM Advocate v. M 2003 SLT 1151. 65.The High Court of Justiciary also considered the compatibility of the introduction of the evidence of an absent witness with Article 6 § 3 (d) in McKenna v. HM Advocate. In that case, a murder trial, the prosecution sought to introduce statements made to the police by a possible co-accused who had since died.

The jury had also been adequately and satisfactorily directed as to how to approach the absent witness’s statement. A similar conclusion was reached by the same court in HM Advocate v. M 2003 SLT 1151. 66.The compatibility of the admission of hearsay evidence with Article6 § 3 (d) was further considered by the High Court of Justiciary in Campbell v. HM Advocate (cited above). The court observed that, in the relevant case-law of this Court, many of the violations of Article 6 § 3 (d) which had been found had arisen in jurisdictions which did not apply the Scots law rule of corroboration: “Most of the situations in which it has been held by the court that there had been a violation of [Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] could not arise in Scotland. Against the requirement for corroboration of all crucial facts, a conviction could not be based solely on the evidence of a single witness, whether in primary or in secondary form. Violations of the Convention right have been established where the principal witness against the accused has not been made available for questioning or, in circumstances where there have been a number of principal witnesses, where none of them has been made so available. No case was cited to us in which a violation was held to have occurred in circumstances where the accused had had an opportunity to question or have questioned the complainer or other direct or central witness and other supporting evidence was in statement form. ‘To a decisive extent’, as used in the European authorities, appears to be concerned with the significance of the evidence as a matter of weight. It is not concerned with any rule that a conviction cannot be based on a single source of evidence. The fact that the hearsay is required to meet the rule about corroboration does not of itself render that hearsay ‘decisive’ in the European sense. In these circumstances we are not persuaded that in every case in which hearsay evidence is a necessary ingredient of the Crown’s corroborated proof there will be a violation of [Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)]. It will, however, be necessary for the trial judge to address, in the context of the whole evidence in the case, the significance of any hearsay evidence relied on by the Crown and to take appropriate action to ensure that the accused’s entitlement to a fair trial is not violated thereby.” 67.The court added that, in directing a jury, the guidance given by the Lord Justice Clerk in the case of N v. HM Advocate (cited above), should be borne in mind. The High Court allowed the appeal of the first appellant in the case of Campbell (cited above) because of the inadequacy of the trial judge’s direction to the jury. It dismissed the second appellant’s appeal in so far as it related to Article 6 of the Convention, finding that the hearsay evidence was not decisive and that the principal evidence against him came from a witness who had testified in court. 68.Campbell was applied in HM Advocate v. Johnston 2004 SLT 1005 where, in a ruling given during the trial, the Lord Ordinary allowed the admission of a witness statement made to the police by a witness who subsequently died before trial; the statement was admissible, inter alia, because it could not be “decisive”. In Humphrey v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC 30, the High Court of Justiciary observed that it had “great difficulty” in understanding the meaning of the word “decisive” in the context of a case based on circumstantial evidence but, in that case, the evidence in the form of a police statement of a witness who had died was not “remotely decisive” and there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction without it. Similar results were reached in Allison v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC 63, and Harkins v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC69. 69.In its March 2010 Consultation Paper on Hearsay in Civil and Criminal Cases, the Law Reform Commission of Ireland provisionally recommended that, subject to existing common law and statutory inclusionary exceptions, hearsay should continue to be excluded in criminal proceedings. It also provisionally recommended that there should be no statutory introduction of a residual discretion to include hearsay evidence and that the concepts of reliability and necessity should not form the basis for reform of the hearsay rule because they lacked clarity. 70.The Commission also noted: “Article 38.1 of the Constitution of Ireland protects the right to cross-examination and that the free admissibility of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings would infringe this constitutionally protected right. There are dangers associated with allowing evidence of unavailable witnesses: it undermines the defendant’s right to a fair trial and creates the potential of miscarriages of justice arising if evidence adduced from the following categories of witnesses is admitted: Where the witness is dead (with the exception of dying declarations); Where a witness because of a bodily or mental infirmity cannot give evidence; Where the witness is outside of the jurisdiction; Where the witness cannot be found.” 71.The Commission declined to recommend that the statutory scheme in England and Wales and in particular section 114 of the 2003 Act, be adopted in . It observed: “This model of reform relaxes the rule in such a manner as to potentially render the rule against hearsay redundant. The categories of admissible hearsay under this model are extended significantly and, in light of the constitutional protection afforded to the right to cross-examination, the Commission is of the provisional opinion that to allow in untested evidence from frightened and unavailable witnesses would undermine this right. The Commission notes that it has provisionally recommended that the courts should retain a discretion to develop the hearsay rule if the necessity exists.” The Commission also found that (subject to possible reservations concerning the ultimate outcome in the present cases), the case-law of this Court appeared broadly in line with the approach taken in Irish law. 72.A strict approach to the exclusion of out-of-court statements has always been taken by the Australian courts (see, for example, Bannon v. The Queen (1995) 185 CLR 1). 73.The admission of hearsay in federal criminal proceedings in is now regulated by the Evidence Act 1995. Section 65 of the Act allows the admission of evidence as to previous representations (for example statements) when a witness is not available to give evidence about an “asserted fact”. Such evidence will be admissible, inter alia, when: (i) the representation was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication (section 65(2)(b)); or (ii) when the representation was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation was reliable (section 65(2)(c)). 74.The use of these provisions to admit the statement of a witness who died before trial was considered by the Federal Court of Australia in Williams v. The Queen (2000) 119 A Crim R 490. The court found that, in the circumstances of the case, the statement made to the police was not sufficiently reliable, particularly when the witness had reasons to tell the police what they wanted to hear. Equivalent statutory provisions were considered by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Harris v. The Queen (2005) 158 A Crim R 454, where the deceased complainant’s statement was found to be sufficiently reliable to be admitted, given that, inter alia, the complainant knew that the police would interview other witnesses in the case. 75.The law of hearsay in Canada has been reformed as a result of three principal decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, which created a “principled approach” to the admissibility of hearsay evidence. 75.The law of hearsay in Canada has been reformed as a result of three principal decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, which created a “principled approach” to the admissibility of hearsay evidence. 76.Firstly, in R. v. Khan [1990] 2 SCR 531, the Supreme Court found that the trial judge had erred in refusing to allow the victim, a three-and-a-half-year-old girl who alleged that she had been sexually assaulted, to give unsworn evidence and his refusal to allow the Crown to introduce statements the child had made to her mother fifteen minutes after the assault. If unsworn evidence could not be given there would be a danger that offences against very young children could never be prosecuted. In respect of the statements to the mother, the Supreme Court found that it was appropriate to take a more flexible but “principled” approach to hearsay. Despite the need for caution, hearsay could be admitted where the two general requirements of necessity and reliability were met. In determining admissibility the trial judge was required to have regard to the need to safeguard the interests of the accused. Concerns as to the credibility of the evidence remained to be addressed by submissions as to the weight to be accorded to it and submissions as to the quality of any corroborating evidence. 77.Secondly, in R. v. Smith [1992] 2 SCR 915 the Court approved the “principled approach” taken in Khan and found that two telephone calls made by the deceased to her mother shortly before her death were admissible. However, the mother’s evidence as to the contents of a third telephone call should have not been admitted as the conditions under which that call was made did not provide the “circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness” which would justify its admission without the possibility of cross-examination. 77.Secondly, in R. v. Smith [1992] 2 SCR 915 the Court approved the “principled approach” taken in Khan and found that two telephone calls made by the deceased to her mother shortly before her death were admissible. However, the mother’s evidence as to the contents of a third telephone call should have not been admitted as the conditions under which that call was made did not provide the “circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness” which would justify its admission without the possibility of cross-examination. 78.Khan and Smith were followed in R. v. Rockey [1996] 3 SCR 829. The Supreme Court was satisfied that any reasonable trial judge would have found it necessary to admit pre-trial statements made by a child, who was fiveyears old at trial, in which he complained that he had been sexually assaulted. It was observed by McLachlin J (concurring in judgment) that the case against the appellant was strong: the child’s statements were entirely consistent and supported, inter alia, by medical evidence and evidence of behavioural changes in him after the assault and the absence of any plausible explanation of someone other than the appellant perpetrating the assault. 79.The third and most significant development in the Supreme Court’s case-law was its judgment in R. v. Khewalon [2006] 2 SCR 787, which took a stricter approach to reliability. The case concerned a complaint of assault made by an elderly resident at a retirement home against one of the home’s employees. The patient, S., gave the police a videotaped statement; the statement was unsworn. After S.’s statement other residents came forward to give statements that they too had been assaulted by the accused. By the time of trial, all those who had made statements, including S, had either died or were no longer competent to testify. Some of the statements were admitted by the trial judge because of the striking similarity between them. The Court of Appeal for excluded all the statements and acquitted the accused. The Supreme Court dismissed the Crown’s appeal from that decision and affirmed the acquittal. The Supreme Court clarified its previous case-law on reliability and stated that the reliability requirement would generally be met by showing: (i) that there was no real concern about whether the statement was true or not because of the circumstances in which it came about; or (ii) that no real concern arose because the truth and accuracy of the statement could nonetheless be sufficiently tested by means other than cross-examination. It was for the trial judge to make a preliminary assessment of the “threshold” reliability of the statement and to leave the ultimate determination of its worth to the fact-finder/jury. All relevant factors had to be considered by the trial judge including, in appropriate cases, the presence of supporting or contradictory evidence. Charron J, giving the unanimous judgment of the court, stated (at paragraph49 of the judgment): “In some cases, because of the circumstances in which it came about, the contents of the hearsay statement may be so reliable that contemporaneous cross-examination of the declarant would add little if anything to the process. In other cases, the evidence may not be so cogent but the circumstances will allow for sufficient testing of evidence by means other than contemporaneous cross-examination. In these circumstances, the admission of the evidence will rarely undermine trial fairness. However, because trial fairness may encompass factors beyond the strict inquiry into necessity and reliability, even if the two criteria are met, the trial judge has the discretion to exclude hearsay evidence where its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.” 80.The court concluded that S.’s statements were not admissible. It observed that the charges against Khelawon in respect of S. were “entirely based” on the truthfulness of the allegations contained in S.’s statements (paragraph 101 of the judgment). The absence of any opportunity to cross-examine him had a bearing on the question of reliability and there were no adequate substitutes for testing the evidence. The principled exceptions to the hearsay rule did not provide a vehicle for founding a conviction on the basis of a police statement, videotaped or otherwise, without more (paragraph 106 of the judgment). Nor could the reliability requirement be met by relying on the inherent trustworthiness of the statement; this was not a case such as Khan where the cogency of the evidence was such that it would be pedantic to insist upon testing by cross-examination. S. was elderly and frail; his mental capacity was at issue and there was medical evidence that his injuries could have arisen from a fall. It was also not clear that he had understood the consequences of his statement for the accused. In the circumstances, S.’s unavailability for cross-examination posed significant limitations on the accused’s ability to test the evidence and, in turn, on the trier of fact’s ability to properly assess its worth. 81.In its report of November 2009, the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong proposed substantial reforms to the admission of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings in that jurisdiction. It proposed that the present rule in Hong Kong against the admission of hearsay evidence should be retained but there should be greater scope to admit hearsay evidence in specific circumstances. The Commission rejected the English statutory scheme contained in the 2003 Act, observing that Hong Kong had none of the statutory mechanisms for excluding hearsay which applied in England and Wales, such as section 126(1) of the 2003 Act and section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (see paragraphs 40 and 45 above). The Commission also observed that grounds for admitting hearsay under section 116 of the 2003 Act, although offering a fair degree of certainty and consistency in decision-making, had “an over-inclusive effect by allowing in all types of relevant evidence, including unreliable hearsay evidence” (paragraph 8.25 of the report). The Commission instead proposed a model of reform, which was based on the approach taken by the New Zealand Law Commission (see paragraph82 below) and the Canadian courts since Khelawon. It recommended that hearsay evidence should be admissible, inter alia, if the trial judge was satisfied that it was necessary to admit the hearsay evidence and that it was reliable. Assessment of reliability by a trial judge should include consideration of whether the hearsay evidence was supported by other admissible evidence. The Commission also recommended that, at any stage of criminal proceedings after hearsay evidence had been admitted, the court should have the power to direct the acquittal of the accused if the trial judge considered that it would be unsafe to convict. In reaching that decision, the court should have regard, inter alia, to the importance of such evidence to the case against the accused. The Commission also found that these recommendations meant that its model of reform would comply with the Chamber judgment in the present cases. 82.The New Zealand Law Commission, in its 1999 Report on Evidence, recommended that the admissibility of hearsay should be based on two considerations: reliability and necessity. That recommendation was enacted in the Evidence Act 2006, which came into force in 2007. Section 18(1) of the Act provides: “A hearsay statement is admissible in any proceeding if— (a)the circumstances relating to the statement provide reasonable assurance that the statement is reliable; and (b)either— (i)the maker of the statement is unavailable as a witness; or (ii)the Judge considers that undue expense or delay would be caused if the maker of the statement were required to be a witness.” (ii)the Judge considers that undue expense or delay would be caused if the maker of the statement were required to be a witness.” 83.“Circumstances” for these purposes are defined in section 16(1) as including: (a) the nature of the statement; (b) the contents of the statement; (c) the circumstances that relate to the making of the statement; (d) any circumstances that relate to the veracity of the person; and (e) any circumstances that relate to the accuracy of the observation of the person. 84.Section 8(1) of the Act provides that evidence must be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the risk that the evidence will (a) have an unfairly prejudicial effect on the proceeding; or (b) needlessly prolong the proceeding. Section 8(2) provides that in determining whether the probative value of evidence is outweighed by the risk that the evidence will have an unfairly prejudicial effect on a criminal proceeding, the judge must take into account the right of the defendant to offer an effective defence. 85.Although jury trials are no longer used in , it too has substantially reformed its law of hearsay. Section 3(4) of the Law of Evidence Amendment Act 45 of 1988 defines hearsay as evidence, whether oral or in writing, the probative value of which depends upon the credibility of any person other than the person giving evidence. By section 3(1) such hearsay evidence is not admissible unless (i) it is admitted by consent; (ii) the person upon whose credibility the evidence depends testifies; or (iii) the court is of the opinion that the evidence should be admitted in the interests of justice. Section 3(1)(c) provides that, in forming its opinion, the court must have regard to: (i) the nature of the proceedings; (ii) the nature of the evidence; (iii)the purpose for which the evidence is tendered; (iv) the probative value of the evidence; (v) the reason why the evidence is not given by the person upon whose credibility the probative value of such evidence depends; (vi)any prejudice to a party which the admission of such evidence might entail; and (vii) any factor which should in the opinion of the court be taken into account. 85.Although jury trials are no longer used in , it too has substantially reformed its law of hearsay. Section 3(4) of the Law of Evidence Amendment Act 45 of 1988 defines hearsay as evidence, whether oral or in writing, the probative value of which depends upon the credibility of any person other than the person giving evidence. By section 3(1) such hearsay evidence is not admissible unless (i) it is admitted by consent; (ii) the person upon whose credibility the evidence depends testifies; or (iii) the court is of the opinion that the evidence should be admitted in the interests of justice. Section 3(1)(c) provides that, in forming its opinion, the court must have regard to: (i) the nature of the proceedings; (ii) the nature of the evidence; (iii)the purpose for which the evidence is tendered; (iv) the probative value of the evidence; (v) the reason why the evidence is not given by the person upon whose credibility the probative value of such evidence depends; (vi)any prejudice to a party which the admission of such evidence might entail; and (vii) any factor which should in the opinion of the court be taken into account. 86.In State v. Ramavhale [1996] ZASCA 14, the Supreme Court observed that, notwithstanding the wording of section 3(1), there remained an “intuitive reluctance to permit untested evidence to be used against an accused in a criminal case”. It also endorsed previous authority that a court should “hesitate long” in admitting or relying on hearsay evidence which plays a decisive or even significant part in convicting an accused, unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. Despite the reforms enacted by section 3(1), the Supreme Court found that reliability was a factor that should continue to be considered in determining the admissibility of hearsay. Moreover, in that case, in assessing what prejudice would arise to the accused if the hearsay were admitted, the trial judge had erred in relying upon the fact that the accused had other avenues open to him to counter the evidence, one of which was to give evidence himself; the logical conclusion of this approach was that the State, by introducing “flimsy” hearsay could force the accused to testify in a case where the absence of direct evidence was such that he would be entitled not to testify. Compelling reasons for admitting hearsay evidence, even though it was decisive, were found to exist in State v. Ndhlovu and others [2002] ZASCA70, not least because the guarantees as to the reliability of the evidence were high and the hearsay evidence interlinked powerfully with the other evidence in the case. The concerns expressed in Ramavhale as to admitting or relying on hearsay evidence which played a decisive or even significant part in convicting an accused were reiterated by the Supreme Court in State v. Libazi and others [2010] ZASCA 91, State v. Mpungose and another [2011] ZASCA 60, and State v. Mamushe [2007] ZASCA 58. In the latter, the Supreme Court observed that it stood to reason that a hearsay statement which would only serve to complete a “mosaic pattern” would be more readily admitted than one which was destined to become a vital part of the State’s case. 87.The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America guarantees the accused in all criminal prosecutions the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him (“the confrontation clause”). In Ohio v. Roberts 448 US 56 (1980) the Supreme Court of the United States of America held that evidence with “particularized guarantees of trustworthiness” was admissible without confrontation. That was overruled in Crawford v.Washington 541 US 36 (2004), where the court ruled that the confrontation clause applied to all evidence which was testimonial in nature and there was no basis in the Sixth Amendment for admitting evidence only on the basis of its reliability. Where testimonial statements were at issue, the only indicium of reliability which was sufficient was the one prescribed by the Constitution: confrontation. Consequently, testimonial evidence was thus inadmissible unless the witness appeared at trial or, if the witness was unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination (see also Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts 129 SCt 2527 (2009), and Bullcoming v. New Mexico 131 SCt 2705 (2011)). The right to confront witnesses will be forfeited if it can be demonstrated that the defendant has frightened the witness into not testifying (see Davis v.Washington 547 US 813 (2006), and Giles v. California 554 US 353 (2008).",2011,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY ASSESSED THE IMPACT THAT THE DEFENDANT’S INABILITY TO EXAMINE A WITNESS HAS HAD ON THE OVERALL FAIRNESS OF HIS TRIAL. IT HAS ALWAYS CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UNTESTED EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DEFENDANT’S RIGHTS HAVE BEEN UNACCEPTABLY RESTRICTED (SEE, AS EARLY EXAMPLES, UNTERPERTINGER, CITED ABOVE, AND BRICMONT V.

THE COMMISSION HAD TAKEN THE SAME APPROACH IN ITS CASE-LAW (SEE, AMONG THE EARLIEST CASES OF THE COMMISSION, X. V. AUSTRIA, NO. 4428/70, COMMISSION DECISION OF 1 JUNE 1972, COLLECTION 40, P. 1; X. V. BELGIUM, NO. 8417/78, COMMISSION DECISION OF 4 MAY 1979, DECISIONS AND REPORTS (DR) 16, P. 205; X. V. GERMANY, NO. 8414/78, COMMISSION DECISION OF 4 JULY 1979, DR 17, P. 231; AND S. V. GERMANY, NO. 8945/80, COMMISSION DECISION OF 13 DECEMBER 1983, DR 39, P. 43).
AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THE COURT HAS ALWAYS INTERPRETED ARTICLE 6 § 3 IN THE CONTEXT OF AN OVERALL EXAMINATION OF THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS. (SEE, AS A RECENT AUTHORITY, SALDUZ V. TURKEY [GC], NO. 36391/02, § 50, ECHR 2008).
144.  TRADITIONALLY, WHEN EXAMINING COMPLAINTS UNDER ARTICLE 6 § 1, THE COURT HAS CARRIED OUT ITS EXAMINATION OF THE OVERALL FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS BY HAVING REGARD TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE WAY IN WHICH STATUTORY SAFEGUARDS HAVE BEEN APPLIED, THE EXTENT TO WHICH PROCEDURAL OPPORTUNITIES WERE AFFORDED TO THE DEFENCE TO COUNTER HANDICAPS THAT IT LABOURED UNDER AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PROCEEDINGS AS A WHOLE HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED BY THE TRIAL JUDGE (SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, JOHN MURRAY, CITED ABOVE).
145.  ALSO, IN CASES CONCERNING THE WITHHOLDING OF EVIDENCE FROM THE DEFENCE IN ORDER TO PROTECT POLICE SOURCES, THE COURT HAS LEFT IT TO THE DOMESTIC COURTS TO DECIDE WHETHER THE RIGHTS OF THE DEFENCE SHOULD CEDE TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND HAS CONFINED ITSELF TO VERIFYING WHETHER THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED BY THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES SUFFICIENTLY COUNTERBALANCE THE LIMITATIONS ON THE DEFENCE WITH APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS. THE FACT THAT CERTAIN EVIDENCE WAS NOT MADE AVAILABLE TO THE DEFENCE WAS NOT CONSIDERED AUTOMATICALLY TO LEAD TO A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 (SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, ROWE AND DAVIS V. THE UNITED KINGDOM [GC], NO. 28901/95, ECHR 2000II). SIMILARLY, IN SALDUZ (CITED ABOVE, § 50), THE COURT REITERATED THAT THE RIGHT TO LEGAL ASSISTANCE, SET OUT IN ARTICLE 6 § 3 (C) WAS ONE ELEMENT, AMONG OTHERS, OF THE CONCEPT OF A FAIR TRIAL IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 6 § 1.
146.  THE COURT IS OF THE VIEW THAT THE SOLE OR DECISIVE RULE SHOULD ALSO BE APPLIED IN A SIMILAR MANNER. IT WOULD NOT BE CORRECT, WHEN REVIEWING QUESTIONS OF FAIRNESS, TO APPLY THIS RULE IN AN INFLEXIBLE MANNER. NOR WOULD IT BE CORRECT FOR THE COURT TO IGNORE ENTIRELY THE SPECIFICITIES OF THE PARTICULAR LEGAL SYSTEM CONCERNED AND, IN PARTICULAR ITS RULES OF EVIDENCE, NOTWITHSTANDING JUDICIAL DICTA THAT MAY HAVE SUGGESTED OTHERWISE (SEE, FOR INSTANCE, LUCÀ, CITED ABOVE, § 40). TO DO SO WOULD TRANSFORM THE RULE INTO A BLUNT AND INDISCRIMINATE INSTRUMENT THAT RUNS COUNTER TO THE TRADITIONAL WAY IN WHICH THE COURT APPROACHES THE ISSUE OF THE OVERALL FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS, NAMELY TO WEIGH IN THE BALANCE THE COMPETING INTERESTS OF THE DEFENCE, THE VICTIM, AND WITNESSES, AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
(C)  GENERAL CONCLUSION ON THE SOLE OR DECISIVE RULE
(C)  GENERAL CONCLUSION ON THE SOLE OR DECISIVE RULE
147.  THE COURT THEREFORE CONCLUDES THAT, WHERE A HEARSAY STATEMENT IS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST A DEFENDANT, ITS ADMISSION AS EVIDENCE WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY RESULT IN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1. AT THE SAME TIME, WHERE A CONVICTION IS BASED SOLELY OR DECISIVELY ON THE EVIDENCE OF ABSENT WITNESSES, THE COURT MUST SUBJECT THE PROCEEDINGS TO THE MOST SEARCHING SCRUTINY. BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF THE ADMISSION OF SUCH EVIDENCE, IT WOULD CONSTITUTE A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR TO BALANCE IN THE SCALES, TO USE THE WORDS OF LORD MANCE IN R. V. DAVIS (SEE PARAGRAPH 50 ABOVE), AND ONE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS, INCLUDING THE EXISTENCE OF STRONG PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS. THE QUESTION IN EACH CASE IS WHETHER THERE ARE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS IN PLACE, INCLUDING MEASURES THAT PERMIT A FAIR AND PROPER ASSESSMENT OF THE RELIABILITY OF THAT EVIDENCE TO TAKE PLACE. THIS WOULD PERMIT A CONVICTION TO BE BASED ON SUCH EVIDENCE ONLY IF IT IS SUFFICIENTLY RELIABLE GIVEN ITS IMPORTANCE IN THE CASE.
(D)  PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS CONTAINED IN THE 1988 AND 2003 ACTS
148.  THE COURT WILL THEREFORE EXAMINE THE COUNTERBALANCING MEASURES IN PLACE IN ENGLISH LAW AT THE RELEVANT TIME. THE COURT OBSERVES THAT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE 1988 AND 2003 ACTS THE ABSENCE OF WITNESSES MUST BE JUSTIFIED AND FALL WITHIN ONE OF THE DEFINED CATEGORIES (SEE SECTION 23 OF THE 1988 ACT AND SECTION 116 OF THE 2003 ACT AT PARAGRAPHS 41 AND 44 ABOVE). WHATEVER THE REASONS FOR THE ABSENCE OF A WITNESS, THE ADMISSION OF STATEMENTS OF A WITNESS WHO IS NOT ONLY ABSENT BUT ANONYMOUS IS NOT ADMISSIBLE.
MOREOVER, WHERE THE ABSENCE IS DUE TO FEAR, UNDER THE 2003 ACT, THE TRIAL JUDGE MAY ONLY GIVE LEAVE IF HE CONSIDERS THE ADMISSION OF THE STATEMENT TO BE IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE AND HE MUST DECIDE WHETHER SPECIAL MEASURES CAN BE PUT IN PLACE TO ALLOW THE WITNESS TO GIVE LIVE EVIDENCE. IN SUCH A CASE, THE TRIAL JUDGE MUST HAVE REGARD TO THE DIFFICULTY FACED BY THE DEFENDANT IN CHALLENGING THE WITNESS STATEMENT IF THE MAKER OF THE STATEMENT IS NOT CALLED.
149.  THE 2003 ACT ALSO PROVIDES THAT, WHATEVER THE REASON FOR THE ABSENCE OF A WITNESS, EVIDENCE RELEVANT TO THE CREDIBILITY OR CONSISTENCY OF THE MAKER OF THE STATEMENT MAY BE ADMITTED EVEN WHERE THE EVIDENCE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ADMISSIBLE HAD THE WITNESS GIVEN EVIDENCE IN PERSON. THE TRIAL JUDGE RETAINS A SPECIFIC DISCRETION TO REFUSE TO ADMIT A HEARSAY STATEMENT IF SATISFIED THAT THE CASE FOR ITS EXCLUSION SUBSTANTIALLY OUTWEIGHS THE CASE FOR ADMITTING IT. OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE IS THE REQUIREMENT UNDER THE 2003 ACT THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE SHOULD STOP THE PROCEEDINGS IF SATISFIED AT THE CLOSE OF THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION THAT THE CASE AGAINST THE ACCUSED IS BASED “WHOLLY OR PARTLY” ON A HEARSAY STATEMENT ADMITTED UNDER THE 2003 ACT, PROVIDED HE OR SHE IS ALSO SATISFIED THAT THE STATEMENT IN QUESTION IS SO UNCONVINCING THAT, CONSIDERING ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE CASE AGAINST THE ACCUSED, A CONVICTION WOULD BE UNSAFE.
150.  THE COURT ALSO NOTES THAT, IN ADDITION TO THE SAFEGUARDS CONTAINED IN EACH ACT, SECTION 78 OF THE POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT 1984 PROVIDES A GENERAL DISCRETION TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE IF ITS ADMISSION WOULD HAVE SUCH AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FAIRNESS OF THE TRIAL THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE ADMITTED. FINALLY, THE COMMON LAW REQUIRES A TRIAL JUDGE TO GIVE THE JURY THE TRADITIONAL DIRECTION ON THE BURDEN OF PROOF, AND DIRECT THEM AS TO THE DANGERS OF RELYING ON A HEARSAY STATEMENT.
151.  THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THE SAFEGUARDS CONTAINED IN THE 1988 AND 2003 ACTS, SUPPORTED BY THOSE CONTAINED IN SECTION 78 OF THE POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT AND THE COMMON LAW, ARE, IN PRINCIPLE, STRONG SAFEGUARDS DESIGNED TO ENSURE FAIRNESS. IT REMAINS TO BE EXAMINED HOW THESE SAFEGUARDS WERE APPLIED IN THE PRESENT CASES.
4.  THE PRESENT CASES
152.  IN TURNING TO THE PRESENT CASES, THE COURT BEGINS BY OBSERVING THAT, IN THE COURSE OF THE HEARING BEFORE THE GRAND CHAMBER, A QUESTION WAS PUT TO THE PARTIES AS TO WHETHER IT WAS ACCEPTED THAT THE TESTIMONY OF S.T. WAS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE EVIDENCE IN RESPECT OF MR AL-KHAWAJA AND THAT THE TESTIMONY OF T. WAS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE EVIDENCE IN RESPECT OF MR TAHERY. IN REPLY TO THAT QUESTION, THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTED FROM THE POSITION THEY HAD TAKEN BEFORE THE CHAMBER AND SUBMITTED THAT NEITHER S.T. NOR T.’S TESTIMONY WAS SOLE OR DECISIVE (SEE PARAGRAPHS 104 AND 105 ABOVE). THE COURT WILL THEREFORE CONSIDER THREE ISSUES IN EACH CASE: FIRSTLY, WHETHER IT WAS NECESSARY TO ADMIT THE WITNESS STATEMENTS OF S.T. OR T.; SECONDLY, WHETHER THEIR UNTESTED EVIDENCE WAS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE BASIS FOR EACH APPLICANT’S CONVICTION; AND THIRDLY, WHETHER THERE WERE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS INCLUDING STRONG PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT EACH TRIAL, JUDGED AS A WHOLE, WAS FAIR WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 6 §§ 1 AND 3 (D).
(A)  THE AL-KHAWAJA CASE
153.  THE COURT OBSERVES THAT IT IS NOT IN DISPUTE THAT S.T.’S DEATH MADE IT NECESSARY TO ADMIT HER WITNESS STATEMENT IF HER EVIDENCE WAS TO BE CONSIDERED.
154.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE GOVERNMENT’S SUBMISSION THAT S.T.’S STATEMENT WAS NOT SOLE OR DECISIVE BECAUSE THERE WAS OTHER EVIDENCE SUPPORTING IT, THE COURT NOTES THAT THE JUDGE WHO ADMITTED S.T.’S STATEMENT WAS WELL PLACED TO EVALUATE ITS SIGNIFICANCE. HE WAS QUITE CLEAR WHEN HE OBSERVED “NO STATEMENT, NO COUNT ONE” (SEE PARAGRAPH 13 ABOVE). IT IS NOT FOR THE COURT, SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS, TO GAINSAY SUCH AN EVALUATION. THE COURT IS THEREFORE COMPELLED TO CONCLUDE THAT S.T.’S STATEMENT WAS DECISIVE.
155.  NEVERTHELESS, AS THE COURT HAS INDICATED (SEE PARAGRAPH 147 ABOVE) THE ADMISSION OF THE STATEMENT IN EVIDENCE CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS CONCLUSIVE AS TO THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE TRIAL, BUT AS A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR TO BE PLACED IN THE BALANCE ALONGSIDE THE PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS NOTED ABOVE AND OTHER COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS PRESENT IN THE CASE.
156.  THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE WERE OBVIOUSLY IN FAVOUR OF ADMITTING IN EVIDENCE THE STATEMENT OF S.T., WHICH WAS RECORDED BY THE POLICE IN PROPER FORM. THE RELIABILITY OF THE EVIDENCE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT S.T. HAD MADE HER COMPLAINT TO TWO FRIENDS, B.F. AND S.H., PROMPTLY AFTER THE EVENTS IN QUESTION, AND THAT THERE WERE ONLY MINOR INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN HER STATEMENT AND THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY HER TO THE TWO FRIENDS, WHO BOTH GAVE EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THERE WERE STRONG SIMILARITIES BETWEEN S.T.’S DESCRIPTION OF THE ALLEGED ASSAULT AND THAT OF THE OTHER COMPLAINANT, V.U., WITH WHOM THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY COLLUSION. IN A CASE OF INDECENT ASSAULT BY A DOCTOR ON HIS PATIENT, WHICH TOOK PLACE DURING A PRIVATE CONSULTATION WHERE ONLY HE AND THE VICTIM WERE PRESENT, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE OF STRONGER CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN EACH OF THE OTHER WITNESSES WAS CALLED TO GIVE EVIDENCE AT TRIAL AND THEIR RELIABILITY WAS TESTED BY CROSS-EXAMINATION.
157.  IT IS TRUE THAT THE JUDGE’S DIRECTION TO THE JURY WAS FOUND TO BE DEFICIENT BY THE COURT OF APPEAL. HOWEVER, THE COURT OF APPEAL ALSO HELD THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN CLEAR TO THE JURY FROM THAT DIRECTION THAT, IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE APPLICANT’S INABILITY TO CROSS-EXAMINE S.T. AND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO SEE AND HEAR HER, HER STATEMENT SHOULD CARRY LESS WEIGHT WITH THEM (SEE PARAGRAPH 22 ABOVE). HAVING REGARD TO THIS DIRECTION, AND THE EVIDENCE OFFERED BY THE PROSECUTION IN SUPPORT OF S.T.’S STATEMENT, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THE JURY WAS ABLE TO CONDUCT A FAIR AND PROPER ASSESSMENT OF THE RELIABILITY OF S.T.’S ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE FIRST APPLICANT.
158.  AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, AND VIEWING THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS AS A WHOLE, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFICULTIES CAUSED TO THE DEFENCE BY ADMITTING THE STATEMENT AND THE DANGERS OF DOING SO, THERE WERE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS TO CONCLUDE THAT THE ADMISSION IN EVIDENCE OF S.T.’S STATEMENT DID NOT RESULT IN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D).
(B)  THE TAHERY CASE
159.  THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT APPROPRIATE ENQUIRIES WERE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE WERE OBJECTIVE GROUNDS FOR T.’S FEAR. THE TRIAL JUDGE HEARD EVIDENCE FROM BOTH T. AND A POLICE OFFICER AS TO THAT FEAR. THE TRIAL JUDGE WAS ALSO SATISFIED THAT SPECIAL MEASURES, SUCH AS TESTIFYING BEHIND A SCREEN, WOULD NOT ALLAY T.’S FEARS. EVEN THOUGH T.’S IDENTITY AS THE MAKER OF THE INCRIMINATING STATEMENT WAS PUBLICLY DISCLOSED, THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRIAL JUDGE THAT T. HAD A GENUINE FEAR OF GIVING ORAL EVIDENCE AND WAS NOT PREPARED TO DO SO EVEN IF SPECIAL MEASURES WERE INTRODUCED IN THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS PROVIDES A SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION FOR ADMITTING T.’S STATEMENT.

HAD A GENUINE FEAR OF GIVING ORAL EVIDENCE AND WAS NOT PREPARED TO DO SO EVEN IF SPECIAL MEASURES WERE INTRODUCED IN THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS PROVIDES A SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION FOR ADMITTING T.’S STATEMENT.
160.  THE COURT NOTES THAT WHEN THOSE PRESENT AT THE SCENE OF THE STABBING WERE ORIGINALLY INTERVIEWED, NO ONE CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN THE APPLICANT STAB S, AND S HIMSELF HAD NOT SEEN WHO HAD STABBED HIM, ALTHOUGH INITIALLY HE PRESUMED IT WAS THE SECOND APPLICANT. T. HAD MADE HIS STATEMENT IMPLICATING THE APPLICANT TWO DAYS AFTER THE EVENT. HE WAS THE ONLY WITNESS WHO HAD CLAIMED TO SEE THE STABBING. HIS UNCORROBORATED EYEWITNESS STATEMENT WAS, IF NOT THE SOLE, AT LEAST THE DECISIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE APPLICANT FOR THAT REASON. IT WAS OBVIOUSLY EVIDENCE OF GREAT WEIGHT AND WITHOUT IT THE CHANCES OF A CONVICTION WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY RECEDED. EVEN THOUGH THE TESTIMONY MAY HAVE BEEN COHERENT AND CONVINCING ON ITS FACE IT CANNOT BE SAID TO BELONG TO THE CATEGORY OF EVIDENCE THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS “DEMONSTRABLY RELIABLE” SUCH AS A DYING DECLARATION OR OTHER EXAMPLES GIVEN BY THE COURT OF APPEAL AND SUPREME COURT IN THEIR HORNCASTLE AND OTHERS JUDGMENTS (SEE PARAGRAPHS 53 AND 60 ABOVE).
161.  SUCH UNTESTED EVIDENCE WEIGHS HEAVILY IN THE BALANCE AND REQUIRES SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE CONSEQUENTIAL DIFFICULTIES CAUSED TO THE DEFENCE BY ITS ADMISSION. RELIANCE IS PLACED BY THE GOVERNMENT ON TWO MAIN COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS: THE FACT THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE CONCLUDED THAT NO UNFAIRNESS WOULD BE CAUSED BY THE ADMISSION OF T.’S STATEMENT SINCE THE APPLICANT WAS IN A POSITION TO CHALLENGE OR REBUT THE STATEMENT BY GIVING EVIDENCE HIMSELF OR CALLING OTHER WITNESSES WHO WERE PRESENT, ONE OF WHOM WAS HIS UNCLE; AND THE WARNING GIVEN BY THE TRIAL JUDGE TO THE JURY THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO APPROACH THE EVIDENCE GIVEN BY THE ABSENT WITNESS WITH CARE.
162.  HOWEVER, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT NEITHER OF THESE FACTORS, WHETHER TAKEN ALONE OR IN COMBINATION, COULD BE A SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCE TO THE HANDICAP UNDER WHICH THE DEFENCE LABOURED. EVEN IF HE GAVE EVIDENCE DENYING THE CHARGE, THE APPLICANT WAS, OF COURSE, UNABLE TO TEST THE TRUTHFULNESS AND RELIABILITY OF T.’S EVIDENCE BY MEANS OF CROSS-EXAMINATION. THE FACT IS THAT T. WAS THE SOLE WITNESS WHO WAS APPARENTLY WILLING OR ABLE TO SAY WHAT HE HAD SEEN. THE DEFENCE WAS NOT ABLE TO CALL ANY OTHER WITNESS TO CONTRADICT THE TESTIMONY PROVIDED IN THE HEARSAY STATEMENT.
163.  THE OTHER EVIDENCE WAS THAT GIVEN BY THE VICTIM S WHO DID NOT KNOW WHO HAD STABBED HIM, ALTHOUGH INITIALLY HE PRESUMED IT WAS THE APPLICANT. HIS EVIDENCE WAS CIRCUMSTANTIAL IN NATURE AND LARGELY UNCONTESTED BY THE APPLICANT. HE GAVE EVIDENCE OF THE FIGHT AND THE APPLICANT’S ACTIONS AFTER THE STABBING (SEE PARAGRAPH 32 ABOVE). WHILE THIS EVIDENCE CORROBORATED SOME OF THE DETAILS OF T.’S TESTIMONY, IT COULD ONLY PROVIDE AT BEST INDIRECT SUPPORT FOR THE CLAIM BY T. THAT IT WAS THE APPLICANT WHO HAD STABBED S.
164.  IT IS TRUE THAT THE DIRECTION IN THE JUDGE’S SUMMING UP TO THE JURY WAS BOTH FULL AND CAREFULLY PHRASED, DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE DANGERS OF RELYING ON UNTESTED EVIDENCE. HOWEVER, THE COURT DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT SUCH A WARNING, HOWEVER CLEARLY OR FORCIBLY EXPRESSED, COULD BE A SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCE WHERE AN UNTESTED STATEMENT OF THE ONLY PROSECUTION EYEWITNESS WAS THE ONLY DIRECT EVIDENCE AGAINST THE APPLICANT.
165.  THE COURT THEREFORE CONSIDERS THAT THE DECISIVE NATURE OF T.’S STATEMENT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY STRONG CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE MEANT THE JURY IN THIS CASE WAS UNABLE TO CONDUCT A FAIR AND PROPER ASSESSMENT OF THE RELIABILITY OF T.’S EVIDENCE. EXAMINING THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS AS A WHOLE, THE COURT CONCLUDES THAT THERE WERE NOT SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DIFFICULTIES TO THE DEFENCE WHICH RESULTED FROM THE ADMISSION OF T.’S STATEMENT. IT THEREFORE FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D) IN RESPECT OF MR TAHERY.
II.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION
166.  ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION PROVIDES:
“IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION OR THE PROTOCOLS THERETO, AND IF THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTY CONCERNED ALLOWS ONLY PARTIAL REPARATION TO BE MADE, THE COURT SHALL, IF NECESSARY, AFFORD JUST SATISFACTION TO THE INJURED PARTY.”
167.  AS NO VIOLATION HAS BEEN FOUND IN RESPECT OF THE FIRST APPLICANT, JUST SATISFACTION NEED ONLY BE CONSIDERED IN RESPECT OF THE SECOND APPLICANT.
168.  THE SECOND APPLICANT MAINTAINED HIS SUBMISSION THAT, UNLIKE THE MAJORITY OF ARTICLE 6 CASES, IT COULD PROPERLY BE SAID THAT HIS CONVICTION FOR THE OFFENCE IN QUESTION AND HIS SUBSEQUENT SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE VIOLATION. BASED ON THE ADDITIONAL TIME HE SERVED IN PRISON AND WITH REFERENCE TO COMPARABLE DOMESTIC AWARDS FOR UNLAWFUL DETENTION, THE SECOND APPLICANT CLAIMED 65,000 POUNDS STERLING (GBP) (APPROXIMATELY 83,830 EUROS (EUR)). THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THEIR SUBMISSIONS THAT THERE WAS NO CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ALLEGED VIOLATION AND THE CONVICTION OF THE APPLICANT, THAT DOMESTIC CASE-LAW WAS OF LIMITED RELEVANCE AND THAT ANY FINDING OF A VIOLATION AMOUNTED TO SUFFICIENT JUST SATISFACTION. ALTERNATIVELY, A MUCH LOWER SUM, SUCH AS THE EUR 6,000 AWARDED IN VISSER V. THE NETHERLANDS (NO. 26668/95, § 56, 14 FEBRUARY 2002), WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
169.  IN ITS JUDGMENT, THE CHAMBER ACCEPTED THAT DOMESTIC CASE-LAW WAS OF LIMITED RELEVANCE TO THE QUESTION OF NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE IN PROCEEDINGS BEFORE IT. IT FOUND, HOWEVER, THAT THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE SECOND APPLICANT, AT LEAST IN RESPECT OF THE CHARGE WHICH WAS BASED ON T.’S STATEMENT, WAS NOT CONDUCTED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CONVENTION AND THAT THE APPLICANT HAD INEVITABLY SUFFERED A DEGREE OF DISTRESS AND ANXIETY AS A RESULT. IT AWARDED THE SUM OF EUR 6,000 BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE.
170.  THE GRAND CHAMBER SEES NO REASON TO DEPART FROM THE CHAMBER’S ASSESSMENT AND ACCORDINGLY MAKES THE SAME AWARD OF EUR 6,000.
171.  BEFORE THE CHAMBER, THE SECOND APPLICANT CLAIMED A TOTAL OF GBP 7,995 FOR COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY EUR 9,079. THIS COMPRISED GBP 5,571.47 (INCLUSIVE OF VALUE-ADDED TAX (VAT)) FOR APPROXIMATELY 45 HOURS’ WORK BY MS TROWLER, WHICH INCLUDED ATTENDANCE AT THE CHAMBER HEARING AND TRAVELLING TIME TO STRASBOURG. SOLICITOR’S COSTS AND EXPENSES WERE GBP 2,423.56 (INCLUSIVE OF VAT) WHICH COVERED COSTS OF GBP 1,734.16 FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 HOURS’ WORK AND GBP 689.40 IN EXPENSES.
172.  BEFORE THE GRAND CHAMBER, THE SECOND APPLICANT CLAIMED A TOTAL OF GBP 3,614.82 IN RESPECT OF SOLICITOR’S COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH COVERED THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE CHAMBER AND THE GRAND CHAMBER. HE ALSO CLAIMED AN ADDITIONAL GBP 3,643 (INCLUSIVE OF VAT) FOR A FURTHER 37 HOURS’ WORK BY MS TROWLER. THIS INCLUDED 17 HOURS’ WORK TO COVER HER ANTICIPATED ATTENDANCE AT THE GRAND CHAMBER HEARING AND TRAVELLING TIME TO STRASBOURG. SHE WAS, IN THE EVENT, UNABLE TO ATTEND THE HEARING.
173.  THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED THE HOURLY RATES WHICH HAD BEEN CHARGED TO BE EXCESSIVE.
174.  THE COURT FINDS THAT THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED ARE NOT EXCESSIVE IN THE LIGHT OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CASE. THUS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 17 HOURS’ ATTENDANCE AND TRAVELLING TIME TO THE GRAND CHAMBER HEARING (WHICH WERE NOT ACTUALLY INCURRED), THE REMAINDER OF THE SECOND APPLICANT’S COSTS AND EXPENSES SHOULD BE MET IN FULL. IT THEREFORE AWARDS EUR 13,150, INCLUSIVE OF VAT, LESS EUR 1,150 ALREADY RECEIVED IN LEGAL AID FROM THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, TO BE CONVERTED INTO POUNDS STERLING ON THE DATE OF SETTLEMENT.
175.  THE COURT CONSIDERS IT APPROPRIATE THAT THE DEFAULT INTEREST RATE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE MARGINAL LENDING RATE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, TO WHICH SHOULD BE ADDED THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS.
FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT
1.  HOLDS, BY FIFTEEN VOTES TO TWO, THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D) IN RESPECT OF MR AL-KHAWAJA;
2.  HOLDS, UNANIMOUSLY, THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D) IN RESPECT OF MR TAHERY;
3.  HOLDS, UNANIMOUSLY,
(A)  THAT THE RESPONDENT STATE IS TO PAY THE SECOND APPLICANT, MR TAHERY, WITHIN THREE MONTHS, THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS, TO BE CONVERTED INTO POUNDS STERLING AT THE RATE APPLICABLE AT THE DATE OF SETTLEMENT:
(B)  THAT FROM THE EXPIRY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED THREE MONTHS UNTIL SETTLEMENT SIMPLE INTEREST SHALL BE PAYABLE ON THE ABOVE AMOUNTS AT A RATE EQUAL TO THE MARGINAL LENDING RATE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK DURING THE DEFAULT PERIOD PLUS THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS;
4.  DISMISSES, UNANIMOUSLY, THE REMAINDER OF THE APPLICANTS’ CLAIM FOR JUST SATISFACTION.
"
109,001-58402,Grand Chamber,"8.Until 1989 the applicant was employed in the private sector, working mainly as a management and accountancy consultant. On the basis of the professional experience he had thus acquired, he applied for a job working for the French State under the overseas cooperation programme.>The French Ministry of Cooperation and Development recruited him – under a contract signed on 13 March 1989 – as a technical adviser to the Minister for the Economy, Planning and Trade of Equatorial Guinea. As head of project, he was to be responsible for drawing up the budget of State investment for 1990 and was to participate in the preparation of the three-year plan and the three-year programme of public investment, in liaison with Guinean civil servants and international organisations. 10.The contract stipulated that the applicant was to be placed at the disposal of the government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea for two ten-month spells separated by a period of home leave calculated on the basis of five days for each month worked. The contract also laid down the conditions of his remuneration and in respect of all other matters referred to the regulations issued pursuant to the Law of 13 July 1972 (see paragraph36 below). 11.On 9 January 1990, following a number of local disagreements, the Guinean authorities placed the applicant once more at the disposal of the French authorities. This caused the termination of his contract on expiry of his period of home leave (see paragraph 31 below). 12.The Ministry intended to give the applicant a new contract when he had completed his home leave, assigning him to duties in Gabon. To be eligible, he had to satisfy two prior conditions, as required of all other applicants for cooperation posts: firstly, candidates had to obtain the approval of the authorities of the country where they were to serve; secondly, they had to be certified medically fit to serve overseas. 13.As the approval of the Gabonese authorities was slow in coming, the Ministry of Cooperation and Development notified the applicant – by a letter of 2 February 1990 – that his contract was to be terminated and informed him that he would subsequently be removed from the Ministry’s establishment with effect from 15 March 1990. 14.The Gabonese authorities’ approval was later given for a post of financial analyst at the Ministry of Public Sector Reform. By a letter of 7February 1990 the Ministry of Cooperation and Development noted this approval and accordingly declared the striking-off decision announced on 2February null and void. The applicant was then summoned to attend the compulsory medical examination to assess his fitness to serve. 15.On 22 February 1990 the doctor responsible for the interministerial medical service, a specialist in tropical medicine, examined the applicant and ordered an additional psychiatric report. In the light of the results of the additional diagnosis, the doctor declared on 15 March 1990 that the applicant was permanently unfit to serve overseas. 16.On 23 March 1990 the Ministry of Cooperation and Development noted that opinion and accordingly informed the applicant that his name was to be removed from the list of the Ministry’s establishment with effect from 15 March 1990. 17.On 16 May 1990 the applicant lodged an application with the Paris Administrative Court to set aside the decision of 23 March 1990 as being unlawful. 18.On 9 November 1990 the Minister for Cooperation and Development filed his defence. 19.By an interlocutory judgment of 16 April 1992 the Paris Administrative Court ordered a medical report in order to ascertain whether, on account of his state of health, the applicant had been unfit in March 1990 to serve as a technical adviser under the overseas cooperation programme. 20.On 21 November 1992 the medical expert filed his report, having interviewed the applicant and given him a medical, psychological and neuropsychiatric examination on 3 September 1992. He gave it as his opinion that the Ministry of Cooperation and Development’s administrative reaction had been excessive and that the applicant’s state of health had not made him unfit to resume his duties after three months’ sick-leave, after which he could have gone before a medical board. 21.On 22 December 1992 the applicant filed a compensation claim, seeking an order requiring the State to pay him two different sums. Firstly, he claimed 550,000 French francs (FRF), which he considered to be the amount of remuneration he would have received if he had remained in post; secondly, he claimed FRF 500,000 in compensation for the personal, pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage he considered he had sustained on account of being struck off. 22.By a decision of 4 January 1993 the Paris Administrative Court fixed the amount payable in costs for the medical report. By a decision of 1March 1993 it corrected a clerical error in the operative provisions of the first decision. 23.On 8 March 1993 the Minister for Cooperation and Development submitted his observations on the medical report. 24.On 14 April 1993 the applicant filed a reply. 25.On 3 May 1993 the Minister for Cooperation and Development submitted his defence to the applicant’s compensation claim of 22December 1992, arguing that it was unfounded. 26.On 14 September and 4 October 1994 the Minister for Cooperation and Development filed a rejoinder and a number of documents. 27.On 13 December 1994 the applicant filed a reply. 28.The case was set down for hearing on 19 January 1995. On 9January 1995 the applicant was informed that the case had been put off to a date to be determined later. 29.On 11 and 18 January 1995 the Minister for Cooperation and Development submitted additional observations and a number of documents. 30.On 16 February 1995 the applicant submitted a reply. 31.By a judgment of 23 October 1997, following a hearing on 25September 1997, the Paris Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s application, as regards both the request to have the striking-off decision set aside and the compensation claim. It held in particular: “...As to the application to set aside the Minister for Cooperation’s decision of [23]March 1990 Firstly, the documents in the file show that Mr Pellegrin’s contract with the State to work in Equatorial Guinea as a participant in the cooperation programme was terminated when the Guinean authorities placed him once more at the disposal of the French State. Although, by a letter of 7 February 1990, the Minister declared null and void the decision of 2 February 1990 announcing that Mr Pellegrin’s name would be removed from the list of the Ministry’s establishment with effect from 15 March 1990, which he did with a view to the signing of a new contract, he did not intend to reactivate the contract under which Mr Pellegrin had been assigned to duties in Equatorial Guinea, since that contract had been automatically terminated when the foreign State placed him once more at the disposal of the French State. Consequently, Mr Pellegrin may not validly argue that the decision of [23] March 1990 unlawfully rescinded the decision of 7 [February] 1990. Secondly, in deciding to remove the applicant’s name from the list of the Ministry’s establishment with effect from 15 March 1990, the Minister was merely drawing the consequences of the fact that the contract assigning Mr Pellegrin to duties in Equatorial Guinea expired on that date and of the fact that no new contract had been signed. Consequently, his decision was not invalidated by any unlawful retrospectiveness; ... Thirdly, the medical report of 21 November 1992 shows that on [23] March 1990 Mr Pellegrin did not satisfy the physical fitness conditions for service overseas. Consequently, he may not validly maintain that the decision of [23] March 1990, which cited the … opinion that he was unfit as ground for refusing him a new contract for the cooperation service in Gabon, was vitiated by an error of judgment; ... As to the compensation claim It follows from the rejection of Mr Pellegrin’s arguments in support of his application to set aside the decision of [23] March 1990 that he may not rely on any culpable unlawfulness making the State liable. Consequently, his claim for compensation from the State for prejudice caused by the decision of [23] March 1990 must be dismissed ...” 32.On 16 January 1998 the applicant gave notice of appeal against the above judgment, which had been served on him on 13 January, and filed his statement of the grounds of appeal. 33.On 10 June 1998 the Minister for Cooperation and Development filed a pleading. 34.On 30 June 1998 the applicant filed a further pleading. 35.The case is pending in the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal. 36.The relevant provisions of the law governing the position of civilian cultural, scientific and technical cooperation staff in post in foreign States (in respect of which two implementing decrees were promulgated on 25April 1978) provide: Section 1 “The civilian staff on whom the State calls to perform cultural, scientific or technical cooperation duties outside French territory at the service of foreign States, particularly by virtue of agreements between France and those States, shall be governed by the provisions of the present Law ...” Section 3 “Without prejudice to the rules governing the exercise of judicial functions, the staff contemplated by the present Law shall serve, while performing their duties, under the authority of the Government of the foreign State or the body at whose service they have been placed, under conditions laid down by agreement between the French Government and the foreign authorities concerned. They shall be required to maintain the propriety and discretion befitting persons performing their duties in the territory of a foreign State and inherent in the publicservice nature of the tasks they carry out ... They shall be forbidden to engage in any act or participate in any event which might be damaging to the French State, local public policy or the relations the French State maintains with foreign States. In the event of failure to respect the obligations contemplated in the previous two paragraphs, their turn of duty may be terminated immediately, without prior formalities, and without prejudice to any administrative proceedings that may be brought against them on their return to France.” 37.Article 48(4) of the Treaty of 25 March 1957 instituting the European Economic Community (“the EEC Treaty”) provides for a derogation from the principle of freedom of movement for workers within the Community in respect of “employment in the public service”. 38.The Court of Justice of the European Communities has developed a restrictive interpretation of this derogation. In its judgment of 17 December 1980 in the case of Commission v. Belgium (C-149/79, ECR 3881) it decided that the derogation concerned only posts which involved direct or indirect participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State or of other public authorities, and which thus presumed on the part of those occupying them the existence of a special relationship of allegiance to the State and reciprocity of rights and duties which formed the foundation of the bond of nationality. 39.The European Commission, to which the EEC Treaty assigned responsibility for ensuring the correct application of Community rules, noted that a large number of posts likely to be caught by the derogation had in reality no bearing on the exercise of powers conferred by public law or protection of the general interests of the State. 40.In a communication of 18 March 1988 it set itself the task of listing separately those activities which are covered by the derogation and those which are not. It thus established two distinct categories of activities according to whether or not they involved “direct or indirect participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State”. These categories were defined as follows: “Exclusion of specific activities in the national public service [from freedom of movement for workers] On the basis of current Court of Justice rulings, and bearing in mind the present conditions for establishing the single market, the Commission considers that the derogation in Article 48(4) covers specific functions of the State and similar bodies such as the armed forces, the police and other forces for the maintenance of order, the judiciary, the tax authorities and the diplomatic corps. This derogation is also seen as covering posts in State Ministries, regional government authorities, local authorities and other similar bodies, central banks and other public bodies, where the duties of the post involve the exercise of State authority, such as the preparation of legal acts, the implementation of such acts, monitoring of their application and supervision of subordinate bodies ... Activities concerned by action in the public service sector The Commission considers that the functions involved in certain forms of public employment are for the most part sufficiently remote from the specific activities of the public service as defined by the Court of Justice that they would only in very rare cases be covered by the exception in Article 48(4) of the Treaty. The Commission proposes therefore to implement its action in the following areas by order of priority: – bodies responsible for administering commercial services (e.g. public transport, electricity and gas supply, airline and shipping companies, posts and telecommunications, radio and television companies), – public health care services, – teaching in State educational establishments, – research for non-military purposes in public establishments. Each of these activities also exists in the private sector, to which Article 48(4) does not apply, or may be exercised in the public sector without the imposition of nationality requirements ...” Where the second category is concerned, the Commission has left it open to EEC member States to try to show that the duties of a given post involve the specific activities of the public service; this would, exceptionally, justify application of the derogation. 41.The Court of Justice has applied and developed these principles in a number of judgments. In its judgment of 2 July 1996 in the case of European Commission v. the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (C-473/93, ECRI-3248), it held: “§ 27... in order to determine whether posts fall within the scope of Article 48(4) of the Treaty, it is necessary to consider whether or not the posts in question typify the specific activities of the public service in so far as it exercises powers conferred by public law and has responsibility for safeguarding the general interests of the State or of other public bodies. For that reason, the criterion for determining whether Article48(4) of the Treaty is applicable must be functional and must take account of the nature of the tasks and responsibilities inherent in the post, in order to ensure that the effectiveness and scope of the provisions of the Treaty on freedom of movement of workers and equal treatment of nationals of all Member States is not restricted by interpretations of the concept of public service which are based on domestic law alone and which would obstruct application of Community rules (judgment in Case 307/84 Commission v. France [1986] ECR 1725, paragraph 12). … § 31... the generality of posts in the areas of research, health, inland transport, posts and telecommunications and in the water, gas and electricity supply services are remote from the specific activities of the public service because they do not involve direct or indirect participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law or duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State or of other public authorities (see, in particular, as regards the area of health, the judgment in Case 307/84 Commission v. France, and, as regards research for civil purposes, the judgment in Case 225/85 Commission v. Italy [1987] ECR 2625). … § 33... the Court has already stated that the very strict conditions which posts must satisfy in order to come within the exception laid down in Article 48(4) of the Treaty are not fulfilled in the case of trainee teachers (judgment in Case 66/85 Lawrie-Blum [1986] ECR 2121, paragraph 28), in the case of foreign-language assistants (judgment in Case 33/88 Allué and Coonan [1989] ECR 1591, paragraph 9) or in the case of secondary school teachers (judgment in Case C-4/91 Bleis [1991] ECR I-5627, paragraph 7). § 34For the same reasons, the same applies to primary school teachers ...”",1999,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

110,001-61075,Grand Chamber,"11.The applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Rome. 12.He is a journalist by profession and on 21 November 1993 he published in the Italian daily newspaper Il Giornale an article about MrG.Caselli, who was at that time the Principal Public Prosecutor in Palermo. The article was entitled “Caselli, the judge with the white quiff” and subtitled “Catholic schooling, communist militancy like his friend Violante – Are the charges against Andreotti the start of a new Sogno case?”. 13.In the article the applicant, after referring to the proceedings brought by Mr Caselli against Mr G. Andreotti, a very well-known Italian statesman accused of aiding and abetting the Mafia (appoggio esterno alla mafia) who has in the meantime been acquitted at first instance, expressed himself as follows: “In the last few days Giulio Andreotti has told an Israeli newspaper that he fears he is to be eliminated. If I may be permitted to begin with a digression, I wonder why he was talking to a foreign paper rather than the Italian press. He’s not the only one. It’s getting to be an epidemic. During the same period the industrialist Carlo De Benedetti chose an English newspaper in which to say that Italy is his Siberia. Even Bettino Craxi, when he feels like uttering threats or complaints, generally does so via the Spanish papers. This might be a form of gratuitous snobbery. But it might also be a victimisation syndrome of the type ‘We’re foreigners in our own country and are obliged to raise our voices abroad in order to make ourselves heard at home.’ That’s what Andreotti is suggesting when he adds that he feels like an exile and the victim of a plot, but he doesn’t exactly know what kind of plot. Those who have seen him recently say that he’s pale, his pointed ears are drooping and he’s bent forward to the point of being hunchbacked. He’s worried about his wife Lidia, who’s been plunged in a kind of cataleptic trance since that fateful 27 March. That was the day when the official notification that he was under investigation – a document running to some 250 typewritten pages – turned the most well known Italian politician into the number one godfather of the Sicilian Mafia. Now Andreotti is bewildered. He tries to understand but he can’t. He thinks there must have been some sort of spur-of-the-moment conspiracy. But the antibody that’s eating away at him has been there for some time. It’s been cultured for years in precisely those religious environments that Andreotti likes best. While he was already dominating Rome in the 1950s Giancarlo Caselli, the Principal Public Prosecutor in Palermo, author of the 250 pages which have annihilated him, was learning his lessons at the school of the Salesian brothers in Turin. Giancarlo was a fine, studious boy. Turin is full of people like that because it’s a rainy city and the houses have no balconies to watch the street from, so there’s nothing else for a boy to do but get his head down over his books. That’s why the place specialises in the mass-production of intellectuals. From Bobbio to Conso, the Minister of Justice. It’s a puritan brotherhood. The more Giancarlo progressed towards self-knowledge the heavier his complex about his father weighed on him. The father was a very worthy man but only the chauffeur of a captain of industry. While driving he breathed in the air of the bourgeoisie and then he blew it out again over his son. The boy decided that when he grew up he would pass over to the other side of the fence. No longer subservient like dad, but keeping the upper hand. At university, he drew close to the PCI [the Italian Communist Party], the party which exalts the frustrated. When he was admitted to the State legal service he swore a threefold oath of obedience – to God, to the Law and to via Botteghe Oscure [formerly the headquarters of the PCI, now those of the PDS – the Democratic Party of the Left]. And Giancarlo became the judge he has remained for the last thirty years – pious, stern and partisan. But he cannot really be understood without a mention here of his alter ego Luciano Violante, Caselli’s twin brother. Both from Turin; the same age – 52; both raised by the Catholic teaching orders; both communist militants; both judicial officers; and a deep understanding between them: when Violante, the head, calls, Caselli, the arm, responds. Luciano has always been one step ahead of Giancarlo. In the mid-1970s he indicted for an attempted coup d’état Edgardo Sogno, a former member of the Resistance, but also an anti-communist. It was a typical political trial which led nowhere. Instead of facing a judicial inquiry, Violante found that his career began to take off. In 1979 he was elected as a Communist MP. And ever since then he has been the via Botteghe Oscure’s shadow Minister of Justice. Today he’s the chairman of Parliament’s anti-Mafia committee, the great choreographer of the to-ing and fro-ing of the pentiti [criminals-turned-informers] and the PDS’s strongman. While Violante was climbing the ladder, Caselli had turned into a handsome figure with the shock of prematurely white hair he’s so proud of. If he goes away anywhere, even on a short trip, he always takes his hairdryer with him. During breaks in proceedings he pats his quiff into place on his forehead and pushes his hair over his ears. Afterwards, as you will have noticed on TV, he moves his head the bare minimum, so as not to ruin his handiwork. Vain – he’s vain. When Giancarlo was a member of the National Council of the Judiciary, from 1986 to 1990, his colleagues used to make fun of him, saying ‘Under his hair there’s nothing there’. That’s true up to a point, as a comment on his narcissism and his ideological blinkers. But it’s not true as regards his intelligence, which cannot be faulted. So far, as can be seen, there’s nothing to suggest that one day Caselli’s and Andreotti’s paths would cross. Apart from his spell at the National Council of the Judiciary, Giancarlo continued to live in Turin. He was a judge in the public eye and in the first line of the battle against terrorism. It was he who obtained the confession of Patrizio Peci, whose evidence as a witness for the prosecution devastated the Red Brigades. In the meantime, the PCI set in motion its strategy for gaining control of the public prosecutors’ offices of every city in Italy. That campaign is still going on, as the PDS has picked up the baton. The whole thing was the product of two linked but very very simple ideas Violante had. The first idea was that if the Communists could not manage to gain power through the ballot box, they could do so through the courts. There was no shortage of material. The Christian Democrats and the Socialists were nothing but thieves and it would be easy to catch them out. The second idea was more brilliant than the first: the opening of a judicial investigation was sufficient to shatter people’s careers; there was no need to go to the trouble of a trial, it was enough to put someone in the pillory. And to do that it was necessary to control the entire network of public prosecutors’ offices. And that was the start of Tangentopoli. The Craxis, De Lorenzos and others were immediately caught with their hands in the till and destroyed. But Andreotti was needed to complete the picture. More cunning than the rest, or not so greedy, the sly old Christian Democrat nearly always avoided getting caught up in corruption cases. It was at that precise moment that Giancarlo was getting ready to leave the rain of Turin for the sun of Palermo. A campaign of unsubstantiated allegations saw off the incumbent public prosecutor Giammanco, who crept away with his tail between his legs. And at the start of this year the handsome judge was able to take Giammanco’s place and finally place Violante’s seal on the Palermo prosecution service. Before he took up his new post Caselli was summoned to the Quirinale [the President’s official residence]. President Scalfaro, knowing the type, was concerned. When he had Caselli in front of him he said: ‘Do whatever you think is right, but be objective.’ Once in Palermo his fate and Andreotti’s, which had remained separate for years, became intertwined. Less than two months later the senator-for-life was suddenly accused of belonging to the Mafia. The file was an implausible rag-bag containing statements by pentiti, old and new documents and information given by the same old Buscetta [a pentito] to Violante and the anti-Mafia committee, now used by Caselli as evidence in a kind of game of ping-pong between the two twins. To cut a long story short, even the most long-lived brontosaurus in the Palazzo [i.e. Palazzo Madama – the Senate-House] was destroyed, thanks to the principle that an accusation is sufficient to destroy anyone. In April Caselli flew off to the United States, where he met Buscetta. He offered the informer 11,000,000 lire a month to continue to cooperate. Buscetta could still be useful to him during the investigation, even if the outcome was no longer of much importance. The result sought had already been achieved. What will happen next is already predictable. In six to eight months’ time the investigation will be closed. But Andreotti will not be able to resurrect his political career. What a stroke of luck. Caselli, on the other hand, will be portrayed as an objective judge whose duty obliged him to prosecute but who realised he had been in the wrong. He will become a hero. And that, if there is a God, cries out for vengeance.” 14.On 10 March 1994, acting on a complaint by Mr Caselli, the judge responsible for preliminary investigations committed the applicant and the manager of Il Giornale for trial in the Monza District Court. The applicant was accused of defamation through the medium of the press (diffamazione a mezzo stampa), aggravated by the fact that the offence had been committed to the detriment of a civil servant in the performance of his official duties. 15.At the trial on 10 January 1996 the civil party asked for the report on the evidence given by Buscetta to the New York judicial authorities and a copy of the Italian weekly newspaper l’Espresso in which that evidence had been published to be added to the file. The defence asked for two press articles concerning Mr Caselli’s professional relations with the pentito Buscetta to be added to the file and for the complainant to be required to give evidence. In an order made on the same day the District Court refused these requests on the grounds that the documents in question were not relevant to the object of the proceedings (defamation) and that there was no point taking evidence from Mr Caselli in view of the tenor of the article written by the applicant. 16.On the same day, applying Article 57, Article 595 §§ 1 and 2 and Article 61 § 10 of the Criminal Code and section 13 of the Press Act (Law no. 47 of 8February 1948), the District Court sentenced the manager of Il Giornale and the applicant to fines of 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 Italian lire (ITL) respectively, payment of damages and costs in the sum of ITL60,000,000, payment of the civil party’s costs and publication of the judgment in Il Giornale. In its reasoning the District Court included the following considerations: “... The author of this article, taking as his theme the case against Senator Giulio Andreotti, gave a biography of the complainant in terms which emphasised his cultural background and above all his ideological leanings – allegedly close to the PCI (now the PDS) – contending that these leanings had decisively influenced [the complainant’s] professional activity to the extent of making him the instrument of a grand design of that party, namely to take control of the judicial organs, particularly the public prosecutors’ offices. Mr Perna stressed the long-standing friendship between the complainant and the MP Violante, asserting that the latter acted as the head in a strategy where Mr Caselli was the arm. He added to his summary biography phrases with a particularly striking literal meaning such as: ‘When he was admitted to the State Legal Service he swore a threefold oath of obedience – to God, to the Law and to via Botteghe Oscure. And Giancarlo became the judge he has remained for the last thirty years – pious, stern and partisan.’ He accused Mr Caselli of having managed ‘the Andreotti investigation’ in furtherance of a grand political design hatched by Violante on behalf of the PCI/PDS, which was to break up by judicial process the dominant political class at the time, so that the favoured party could take power by non-electoral means. He suggested that the charges against Mr Andreotti, the last politician of any standing not to have been laid low by the ‘clean hands’ [mani pulite] inquiries in progress, should be seen in the context of that exploitation of the investigation. ... The defamatory nature of the article ... is absolutely manifest, given that the text categorically excluded the possibility that Mr Caselli might be faithful to the deontological obligations of his duties as an officer in the State legal service and denied that he possessed the qualities of impartiality, independence, objectivity and probity which characterise the exercise of judicial functions, an activity which the complainant was even alleged to have used for political ends, according to the author of the article. In the present case exercise of the right to report current events cannot be pleaded as an extenuating circumstance, Mr Perna not having adduced the slightest evidence in support of his very serious allegations. Nor can he rely on exercise of the right to comment on them – a right which would certainly be enjoyed by a journalist who, in reporting court proceedings, criticises this or that measure – given that the offending assertions in the article amount to nothing more than an unjustified attack on the complainant, which foully besmirched his honour and reputation. ...” 17.The applicant appealed. Relying on the freedom of the press, and in particular the right to report and comment on current events, he contended, among other arguments, that what he had written about Mr Caselli’s political leanings was true and that the court could have verified that by agreeing to take evidence from the complainant himself; that Caselli and Violante were indeed friends; and that it was likewise true that Caselli had used the help of the pentito Buscetta in the proceedings against Andreotti, and, as the representative of the State, had paid him sums of money, all pentiti being remunerated by the Italian State. Describing himself in addition as an opinion columnist (opinionista), he asserted that he had not intended to give a biography of Caselli but rather to express his critical opinions, in a figurative and forceful way. More precisely, he had made critical judgments, which were admittedly more or less well founded and with which readers might or might not agree, but which were explicitly derived from the factual premise, namely Caselli’s political activity. Lastly, he demanded that evidence be taken from the complainant and from certain journalists and figures in Italian politics who, like Mr Caselli, had been Communist Party militants. In particular, he asked for evidence to be taken from Mr S. Vertone and Mr G. Ferrara and for press articles on interviews in which the two men had confirmed the complainant’s active political militancy to be added to the file. In particular, in an interview published in the daily newspaper Corriere della Sera on 11 December 1994, extracts from which were quoted in the applicant’s appeal, Mr Vertone had stated, inter alia, that the complainant was a brave man of great integrity but that he was influenced by the cultural and political model of communism, that his relations with the former Communist Party had been very close and that he had later all but joined the party. In an interview given to another daily newspaper, La Stampa, which published it on 9 December 1994, Mr Ferrara had asserted that he had taken part in dozens of political meetings with Caselli and Violante among others during the 1970s in the Turin federation of the former Communist Party. He had gone on to say that although Caselli, a man of integrity, had done good work against terrorism as an officer of the State legal service, he was heavily politicised and should therefore avoid speaking like a tribune of the people. 18.In a judgment of 28 October 1997 the Milan Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal, ruling as follows: “... the statements noted in the charges ... are undeniably seriously damaging to the reputation of the injured party. They go further than casting doubt – as the charges say – on Mr Caselli’s loyalty to the country’s institutions, his faithfulness to the principle of legality, his objectivity and his independence; they categorically deny that he possesses those qualities and even attribute to him, among other accusations, instances of conduct which constitute disciplinary and criminal offences.” The Court of Appeal held that it was evident that the article essentially referred to facts, some of which were not in the least defamatory and were therefore not relevant to the decision to be taken. “In particular, the following elements are undeniably facts (not judgments), and one of the appeal pleadings (from lawyer D’A.) refers to them as such: (i)Giancarlo Caselli’s political leanings; (ii)the friendship between Mr Caselli and MP Violante; (iii)the information that as public prosecutor in Palermo Mr Caselli used the statements of the criminal-turned-informer Buscetta in the investigation concerning Mr Andreotti, and the information that the same Buscetta, like other pentiti, is paid by the State. Those elements are facts and in itself merely stating them is not in the least defamatory; they are therefore not relevant to the decision this Court has to take. That seems quite obvious as regards the last two pieces of information above, but is also true of the first (Giancarlo Caselli’s political leanings), since the State guarantees not only freedom of thought and the freedom to express thoughts but also the freedom of association in political parties. It is therefore not relevant to try to ascertain what political beliefs Giancarlo Caselli holds and whether or not he expressed them in specific circumstances (and at all events outside the judicial sphere and the performance of his duties) since that information could not in any case be considered defamatory in itself... There is therefore no basis for the request that the proceedings be reopened, firstly so that Giancarlo Caselli can be heard as a witness, and secondly to obtain the production of the press articles of Saverio Vertone and Giuliano Ferrara, but also so that witness evidence can be taken from them, once again on the subject of [Caselli’s] political militancy or at any rate of [his] ... political participation in the PCI/PDS. First of all, that information, as has already been said, is barely touched upon in the article, and in the second place it cannot in any event be regarded as damaging to the complainant’s reputation and accordingly does not need to be verified.” 19.Other facts imputed to the complainant were, on the contrary, undeniably defamatory. First of all, there was the oath of obedience, which, beyond its symbolic import, bore the precise accusation that Mr Caselli had given a personal and lasting undertaking to “obey”, in the course of his duties, the law, his religious beliefs and “the instructions of the leaders” of a political party. The Court of Appeal continued: “The remainder of the article, which gives a highly defamatory account of MrCaselli’s alleged obedience to the Communist Party, confirms that the journalist was not expressing judgments or personal opinions but imputing specific conduct to Mr Caselli. Further on the article asserts (i)that Mr Caselli is Mr Violante’s twin brother, ... (ii)that the PCI ... set in motion a strategy of seizing control of all the public prosecutors’ offices in Italy by applying two of the MP’s ideas, the first being to gain power ... by using the judicial machine and the second to resort simply to opening a judicial investigation ... in order to destroy the careers [of political opponents] since there was no need to go to the trouble of a trial, it was enough to put someone in the pillory. It is in that context that the journalist referred to two actions by Giancarlo Caselli: his request for a transfer to the Palermo public prosecutor’s office and subsequent appointment to the post of public prosecutor there and his notification to Mr Andreotti that he faced prosecution for belonging to a Mafia-type organisation. ... The journalist Perna did not therefore express opinions or judgments but attributed to the complainant Giancarlo Caselli in a highly defamatory manner conduct and acts about which – and here we can only repeat what the District Court said – he did not adduce a scrap of evidence; he did not even seek to prove his case, as his lawyers argue that he was merely expressing opinions. ... The journalist [having] attributed specific acts to public prosecutor Giancarlo Caselli without verifying his assertions in any way and in a totally gratuitous manner, his conduct cannot be explained by errors or misunderstandings, but only as a deliberate act. That is confirmed by the literal content of the whole article, in which the person of Giancarlo Caselli is constantly and subtly denigrated, even though a few positive remarks are skilfully mixed in with the attacks. ... The content of the whole article shows that there was no unintentional fault on the defendant’s part but that he was fully aware that he was damaging another’s reputation and even that he intended to do so.” 20.In a judgment of 9 October 1998, deposited with the registry on 3December 1998, the Court of Cassation upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment, ruling that it was quite correct both as regards the merits and from the procedural point of view. “... Contrary to what has been alleged, the requests for leave to adduce evidence filed by the defence were interpreted in accordance with their exact significance and probative value and were rightly refused because they were totally devoid of relevance to the decision. The appeal written and signed jointly by the defendant Perna and his lawyer MrCaiazza contains a request for the proceedings to be reopened, with a view, firstly, to ‘taking witness evidence from the civil party’, in particular ‘about the forms and modalities of his militancy, or at least of his political participation in the activities of the PCI/PDS during the period when he was already a public prosecutor, and about all the other points which offended the complainant’. The absolutely vague and irrelevant nature of the request is manifest in the light of the tenor of the phrases used by Mr Perna (in whose article the allusion to Mr Caselli’s militancy is by no means limited, as Mr Caiazza argued in the grounds of appeal, to the assertion that Mr Caselli associated himself with the Communist Party while he was at university, an assertion which would, incidentally, not constitute an insult); the article set out to give a detailed account of the forms taken by that militancy by imputing certain acts to Mr Caselli with the aim of proving that his militancy existed. Consequently, either this point remains vague or the problem is resolved by trying to make the complainant admit the facts noted in the charges, with the result that the burden of proof is shifted away from [Mr Perna and Mr Montanelli]. ... Moreover, the ‘direct witnesses’, Giuliano Ferrara and Saverio Vertone, are mentioned in connection with the above point [the forms taken by the complainant’s militancy]; what has just been said about the vagueness and irrelevance of that point therefore applies equally to those persons. Furthermore, giving further details about facts of which they had direct knowledge would have had no bearing on the trial since these were assertions which the trial court did not consider offensive and to speak of this as exculpatory evidence is accordingly meaningless. Lastly, Mr Caselli’s militancy within the PCI has nothing to do with the specific facts attributed to him, and therefore with his alleged oath of obedience to via Botteghe Oscure (to which, however, this ground of appeal makes no allusion), with the relations between Caselli and Violante and above all with an alleged link with Buscetta. Apart from the procedural aspect of the question, it should be stated at the outset that even the argument that the content of the article was not objectively offensive is absolutely devoid of foundation, as the judgment given by the trial court was justified in every respect as regards the offensive nature, for a man even more than for an officer of the State legal service, of imputations of specific facts implying a lack of personality, dignity, independent thought, coherence and moral honesty, and conduct signifying explicitly that there have been instances of dereliction of professional duty. ... The trial court’s reasoning on the extenuating circumstances of the right to report current events and the right to comment on them is also correct, as evidenced by an appropriate statement of the reasons which was free of mistakes in law and errors of logic. No link can be established, and moreover no link was established by the Court of Appeal, between the personality [of Mr Caselli] and an alleged right to report current events exercised through the offensive imputation of facts which have not been proved to be true and play no informative role. The essential point in the judgment is its categorical exclusion of the idea that the article expressed a critical judgment, hence the rejection of the plea that the right to freedom of expression constituted an extenuating circumstance. And in fact it is precisely by virtue of this comparative parameter and of its accessory powers of cognition that this court must repeat that the reasons given [by the Court of Appeal] are immune to criticism: the article is quite clearly a bare list of acts and conduct imputed to Mr Caselli in which there cannot be seen, even in veiled form, the slightest contribution to thought which might be regarded as a critical judgment, or even the attempt at irony which is said to be hidden in the elusive ‘caustic phrases’ referred to in the grounds of appeal. As the Court of Appeal concluded, this case was not about respect for the limits of formal propriety. It follows from all of the foregoing considerations that, as it is impossible to speak of critical comment, there is no cause to expatiate about exercise of the right to comment, still less about the extenuating circumstance of gross negligence in the exercise of the right to comment or about the hypothetical exercise of that right. ...”",2003,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

57,001-108072,Grand Chamber,"9.The first applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Brighton. The facts which gave rise to his application are as follows. 10.While working as a consultant physician in the field of rehabilitative medicine, the first applicant was charged on two counts of indecent assault on two female patients while they were allegedly under hypnosis. The first count in the indictment alleged that he had indecently assaulted a woman called S.T. during a consultation on 3 June 2003. The second count in the indictment alleged that he had indecently assaulted a woman called V.U. also during a consultation, this time on 12 June 2003. 11.For reasons unrelated to the alleged assault, S.T. committed suicide before the trial. However, several months after the alleged assault, she had made a statement to the police. She had also told two friends, B.F. and S.H., that the applicant had indecently assaulted her. 11.For reasons unrelated to the alleged assault, S.T. committed suicide before the trial. However, several months after the alleged assault, she had made a statement to the police. She had also told two friends, B.F. and S.H., that the applicant had indecently assaulted her. 12.On 22 March 2004 a preliminary hearing was held to determine whether S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury. At that hearing, the defence indicated that the defence to each count of the indictment was essentially the same, namely that S.T. and V.U.’s allegations were wholly untrue. The judge at the hearing decided that S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury at trial. He observed that the first applicant was very likely to feel that he had no realistic alternative other than to give evidence in order to defend himself on the second count relating to V.U. Therefore, the reading of S.T.’s statement would not have the effect of making it very difficult for the applicant not to give evidence. The judge also noted that collusion between S.T. and V.U. was not alleged, and so that issue did not need to be investigated by cross-examination of each woman. 12.On 22 March 2004 a preliminary hearing was held to determine whether S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury.

The judge also noted that collusion between S.T. and V.U. was not alleged, and so that issue did not need to be investigated by cross-examination of each woman. 13.Having regard to the contents of S.T.’s statement, the judge also observed that it was crucial to the prosecution on count one as there was no other direct evidence of what took place during the consultation on 3 June 2003. He said: “[P]utting it bluntly, no statement, no count one.” He went on to observe that the real issue was whether it was likely to be possible for the first applicant to controvert the statement in a way that achieved fairness to the defendant. The judge found that the first applicant could give evidence as to what had happened during the consultation. It was also the intention of the prosecution to call S.T.’s friends to give evidence as to what she had said to them. There were inconsistencies between their statements and S.T.’s, which provided a route by which S.T.’s statement could be challenged. An expert witness would also be called by the prosecution to give evidence on altered perception during hypnosis and cross-examination of that witness might also serve to undermine S.T.’s credibility. 14.At the trial, once S.T.’s statement had been read, the jury heard evidence from B.F. and S.H., S.T.’s friends. S.T.’s general practitioner also gave evidence as to a letter he had written on S.T.’s behalf to the hospital authorities, which outlined S.T.’s allegations against the first applicant. In respect of the second count, the indecent assault upon V.U., evidence was given by V.U. and by the police officers who had investigated the case. Evidence was then given by two women who alleged that the first applicant had made improper suggestions to them during hypnosis consultations. That evidence was relied on by the prosecution as “similar fact evidence” to support the evidence of S.T. and V.U. As the prosecution had indicated, expert evidence was given as to the effects of hypnosis. The defence was given the opportunity to cross-examine all the witnesses who gave live evidence. The first applicant gave evidence in his own defence. He also called a number of witnesses, who gave evidence as to his good character. 14.At the trial, once S.T.’s statement had been read, the jury heard evidence from B.F. and S.H., S.T.’s friends.

The first applicant gave evidence in his own defence. He also called a number of witnesses, who gave evidence as to his good character. 15.In his summing up, the trial judge directed the jury, on two separate occasions, as to how they should regard S.T.’s statement. Firstly, he stated: “It is very important that you [the jury] bear in mind when considering her [S.T.’s] evidence that you have not seen her give evidence; you have not heard her give evidence; and you have not heard her evidence tested in cross-examination [by counsel for Mr Al-Khawaja], who would, undoubtedly, have had a number of questions to put to her.” “It is very important that you [the jury] bear in mind when considering her [S.T.’s] evidence that you have not seen her give evidence; you have not heard her give evidence; and you have not heard her evidence tested in cross-examination [by counsel for Mr Al-Khawaja], who would, undoubtedly, have had a number of questions to put to her.” 16.He later stated: “... bear in mind ... that this evidence was read to you. The allegation is completely denied ... you must take that into account when considering her evidence.” “... bear in mind ... that this evidence was read to you. The allegation is completely denied ... you must take that into account when considering her evidence.” 17.When referring to the evidence of S.T.’s friends, the trial judge reminded the jury that there was an inconsistency between S.T.’s account of the consultation and the account given by S.H. (in her statement S.T. said that the applicant had touched her face and mouth; S.H. gave evidence that it was S.T. herself and not the first applicant who had touched her face and mouth). The trial judge continued: “It is for you to decide the extent to which the evidence of [B.F.] and [S.H.] helps you in deciding whether or not [S.T.] has spoken the truth in her statement. But bear in mind the evidence as to what [S.T.] said to [B.F.] and [S.H.] is not independent evidence as to the truth of her allegations.” “It is for you to decide the extent to which the evidence of [B.F.] and [S.H.] helps you in deciding whether or not [S.T.] has spoken the truth in her statement. But bear in mind the evidence as to what [S.T.] said to [B.F.] and [S.H.] is not independent evidence as to the truth of her allegations.” 18.The trial judge also instructed the jury that they were entitled to consider the evidence of V.U., and of the other two women who had given evidence as to the improper suggestions made by the first applicant, when deciding whether S.T.’s statement was true. However, the jury firstly had to discount the possibility of collusion between the four women. Secondly, they had to ask themselves whether it was reasonable that four people independently making similar accusations could all either be lying or mistaken or have all suffered similar hallucinations or false memory. If the jury thought that incredible, they could be satisfied that S.T. and V.U. had spoken the truth. The trial judge also directed the jury that the greater the similarity between the allegations, the greater the likelihood that the four women were telling the truth. He added that the jury also had to consider whether the women could have consciously or unconsciously been influenced by hearing of the complaints of the others. 19.In the course of their deliberations, on two occasions the jury asked for clarification of points raised in the statement of S.T. On 30 November 2004, the first applicant was convicted by a unanimous verdict of the jury on both counts of indecent assault. He was sentenced to a fifteen-month custodial sentence on the first count and a twelve-month custodial sentence on the second count, to run consecutively. 20.The first applicant appealed against his conviction to the Court of Appeal. The appeal centred on the pre-trial ruling to admit S.T.’s statement as evidence. It was also submitted that, in his summing up, the trial judge did not give adequate directions to the jury as to the consequential disadvantage of this evidence to the first applicant. 21.The appeal was heard and dismissed on 6 September 2005. In its written judgment handed down on 3 November 2005 the Court of Appeal concluded that the first applicant’s right to a fair trial had not been infringed. With regard to the admission in evidence of the statement of S.T., the court held that it was not necessarily incompatible with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention. Relying on Doorson v. the Netherlands (26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II), the court held that the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter of domestic law. It then found: “25.The important factors in the present case are the following. The witness, S.T., could not be examined on behalf of the [first applicant] because she had died. She was the only witness whose evidence went directly to the commission of an indecent assault on her by the appellant. If her statement had been excluded, the prosecution would have had to abandon the first count. The [applicant] was able to attack the accuracy of [S.T.’s] statement by exploring the inconsistencies between it and the witnesses, [B.F.] and [S.H.], and through the expert evidence relating to ‘altered perception’ under hypnosis. The relevant sections of the 1988 Act [see paragraph 41 below] contained provisions designed to protect defendants, which were properly considered by the judge, before the statement was admitted in evidence. Lastly, the tribunal of fact, here the jury, could and should take proper account of the difficulties which the admission of a statement might provide for the [applicant], which should be provided by an appropriate direction to the jury. 26.Where a witness who is the sole witness of a crime has made a statement to be used in its prosecution and has since died, there may be a strong public interest in the admission of the statement in evidence so that the prosecution may proceed. That was the case here. That public interest must not be allowed to override the requirement that the defendant have a fair trial. Like the court in Sellick [see paragraph 48 below] we do not consider that the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights requires the conclusion that in such circumstances the trial will be unfair. The provision in Article 6 § 3 (d) that a person charged shall be able to [have] the witnesses against him examined is one specific aspect of a fair trial: but if the opportunity is not provided, the question is ‘whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way the evidence was taken, were fair’ – Doorson, paragraph 19 [see paragraph 58 below]. This was not a case where the witness had absented himself, whether through fear or otherwise, or had required anonymity, or had exercised a right to keep silent. The reason was death, which has a finality which brings in considerations of its own, as has been indicated at the start of this paragraph.” 26.Where a witness who is the sole witness of a crime has made a statement to be used in its prosecution and has since died, there may be a strong public interest in the admission of the statement in evidence so that the prosecution may proceed.

The reason was death, which has a finality which brings in considerations of its own, as has been indicated at the start of this paragraph.” 22.Turning to the issue of the trial judge’s summing up, the court stated: “We consider that it would have been better if the judge had stated explicitly that the [first applicant] was potentially disadvantaged by the absence of [S.T.] and that in consequence of the inability to cross-examine her and of the jury to see her, her evidence should carry less weight with them. Nonetheless, in the circumstances of this case it must have been wholly clear to the jury from the directions the judge did give, that this was the purpose of his remarks. We therefore consider that the jury were given an adequate direction as to the consequences of [S.T.’s] statement being in evidence in her absence, and that this is not a factor which might make the [first applicant’s] trial unfair and in breach of Article 6. We should also say that overall the evidence against the [first applicant] was very strong. We were wholly unpersuaded that the verdicts were unsafe.” 23.The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords but certified that a point of law of general public importance was involved in the decision. 24.On 30 November 2005 the first applicant petitioned the House of Lords on the point of law certified by the Court of Appeal. On 7 February 2006 the House of Lords refused the petition. 25.The second applicant was born in 1975. His application arises from his conviction for wounding with intent. The background to that conviction is as follows. 26.On 19 May 2004, S., a member of the Iranian community living in London, was involved in an altercation with some Kurdish men. The second applicant interposed himself between S. and the Kurdish men in order to protect S. In the small hours of the morning of 20 May 2004, S. and the second applicant met again outside an Iranian restaurant in Hammersmith, . The second applicant asked S to have a word with him and led him into a nearby alleyway. The men began discussing the earlier altercation. Although S. denied throwing the first punch, he conceded while giving evidence at the second applicant’s trial that he had punched the second applicant. In the fight, the second applicant pushed S. back and, at this stage, S. became aware of a burning sensation in his back, which proved to be the result of three stab wounds to his back. S. and the second applicant had been face-to-face and S.’s account was that he neither saw the second applicant stab him, nor was he aware of the second applicant going behind him or reaching round his back, so as to stab him. 27.During the fight other men were present, including the Kurdish men from the earlier altercation. A friend of S., another member of the Iranian community called T., was there, as were two of T.’s friends and the second applicant’s uncle. S could not say which of the men were behind him. 28.S. saw a knife lying on the ground and he realised that he had been stabbed. In his evidence at the second applicant’s trial (see paragraph 32 below), he stated that he went to pick it up but that either the second applicant or T. had picked it up and thrown it towards the restaurant. S. assumed that it had been the second applicant who had stabbed him. According to S., the second applicant immediately denied this. He told S. to sit down beside him and attempted to staunch the blood flow from S.’s wounds until an ambulance arrived; when it did, he accompanied S to the hospital. At the hospital, the second applicant told the police that he had seen two black men stab S. 29.When witnesses were questioned at the scene, no one claimed to have seen the second applicant stab S. Two days later, however, T. made a statement to the police that he had seen the second applicant stab S. In his statement, T. recounted that, when the second applicant and S. had begun fighting in the alleyway, T. had tried to separate them. He then saw the second applicant hold S. by the neck, hold up the knife and stab S. twice in the back. As T. moved towards the second applicant, the second applicant tried to stab T. in the neck. According to T., the second applicant then dropped the knife and shouted “don’t tell the police”. 29.When witnesses were questioned at the scene, no one claimed to have seen the second applicant stab S. Two days later, however, T. made a statement to the police that he had seen the second applicant stab S. In his statement, T. recounted that, when the second applicant and S. had begun fighting in the alleyway, T. had tried to separate them. He then saw the second applicant hold S. by the neck, hold up the knife and stab S. twice in the back. As T. moved towards the second applicant, the second applicant tried to stab T. in the neck. According to T., the second applicant then dropped the knife and shouted “don’t tell the police”. 30.On 3 November 2004 the second applicant was arrested and taken to Hammersmith police station. In interview, he denied stabbing S. and again stated that two black men were responsible. He was charged with wounding with intent and also with attempting to pervert the course of justice for telling the police, at the hospital and at the police station, that he had seen two black men stab S. 31.On 25 April 2005 the second applicant’s trial began at Blackfriars Crown Court. That day, he pleaded guilty in respect of the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice but maintained his not guilty plea in respect of the charge of wounding with intent. 31.On 25 April 2005 the second applicant’s trial began at Blackfriars Crown Court. That day, he pleaded guilty in respect of the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice but maintained his not guilty plea in respect of the charge of wounding with intent. 32.S. gave evidence for the prosecution. He recounted how he and the second applicant had fought in the alleyway. After a minute he realised that he had been injured in the back. He had not seen who stabbed him. The second applicant had made him sit down and had covered the wound. S. had asked the second applicant who had stabbed him and the second applicant had denied that it was him. When cross-examined, S. accepted that he had not seen the second applicant go behind him and that they had been face-to-face. He also testified that he had heard someone shout to him “Tell him it was the blacks”; the voice did not belong to the second applicant. 33.After S had given evidence, the prosecution made an application for leave to read T.’s statement pursuant to section 116(2)(e) and (4) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”; see paragraphs 43-45 below). The prosecution argued under the 2003 Act that T. was too fearful to attend trial before the jury and that he should qualify for special measures. The trial judge heard evidence from a police officer conducting the case who testified that the Iranian community was close-knit and that T.’s fear was genuine. T.also gave evidence to the trial judge (but not the jury) from behind a screen. He told the judge that he was in fear for himself and his family because of visits and telephone calls he had received, none of which were said to have been from the second applicant. He did not say who had been responsible for the visits and telephone calls. 34.In ruling that leave should be given for the statement to be read to the jury, the trial judge stated: “I am satisfied in those circumstances upon the criminal standard of proof that this witness is genuinely in fear; and I base that not only on his oral testimony, but also upon my opportunity while he was in the witness box to observe him. I therefore have to go on to consider the questions posed in [section 116(4) of the 2003 Act]. Subsection 4(a) requires me to look at the statement’s contents. I have done so. It is submitted by the defence that they may be unreliable; there being some inconsistencies with the evidence that was given by [S.]. There will always be cases, whether it be oral evidence or evidence that is read, where there are inconsistencies. It is always for the jury to come to a conclusion, based upon submissions of counsel and the evidence that they have heard, as to whether the evidence is reliable or not. And they will receive from me the appropriate warning when the time comes as to how they should view that statement. It is further submitted that in looking at the statement, it is a statement of great importance; in that it is from a person who purports to witness the incident and consequently goes to the heart of the matter. In my view, it is precisely this type of witness who is likely to be put in fear, and consequently that must have been what Parliament had in mind when it enacted this particular section. I therefore have to look, having looked at the contents of the statement, to any risk its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to any party to the proceedings. I am satisfied that there would be an unfairness caused by its exclusion; but I am equally satisfied that no unfairness would be caused by its admission. And in doing so, I have taken into account the words of [the 2003 Act]; in particular how difficult it will be to challenge the statement if the relevant person does not give oral evidence. Challenge of a statement does not always come from cross-examination. Challenge of a statement can be caused by evidence given in rebuttal; by either the defendant, if he chooses to do so, or by any other bystander – and we know that there were some – who were on the street at that time. Consequently I am satisfied that the defendant’s evidence, if he chooses to give it, would be sufficient to rebut and to challenge the evidence that is contained in that statement. I have further considered other relevant factors, and I have also offered to the witness whilst he was in the witness box behind screens the possibility of him giving evidence with the same special measures in place. He told me his position would not change; that he could not give evidence before a jury, and the reason that he could not was because he was in fear. Having taken all those matters into account in those circumstances, I am satisfied that this is the type of case which Parliament envisaged might require a statement to be read.” 35.T.’s witness statement was then read to the jury. Evidence was also given by the doctor who had treated S. at hospital as to the nature of the wound and by a forensic scientist who had tested the blood found on the second applicant’s clothes and confirmed it matched that of S. (though no firm conclusions could be drawn as to how it had been deposited on the clothes). The record of the second applicant’s interview by the police was also tendered by the prosecution (see paragraph 30 above). 36.The second applicant gave evidence in his defence. He stated that he had been present at the earlier altercation with the Kurdish men. When he and S. later met outside the restaurant, he had taken S. by the hand and suggested that they go and talk, but S. had begun to punch him. He had defended himself by grabbing S. by the collar and pushing him. T. had then tried to intervene and a number of other members of the Iranian community had restrained S. T. had been standing between S. and the second applicant and, at this stage, the second applicant noticed the knife on the ground. He had picked it up and thrown it, not knowing at this point that S. had been stabbed. When S blamed him for the stabbing, the second applicant had told him to sit down and had successfully calmed him down. He placed his hand on the wound on S.’s back. S. then appeared to accept that the second applicant had not stabbed him. The second applicant also gave evidence that he had told the police that two black men were responsible because this was what his uncle had told him to say. Finally, the second applicant gave evidence that, before he had been interviewed by the police, T. had told him that he, T., knew that the second applicant had not stabbed S. 36.The second applicant gave evidence in his defence.

Finally, the second applicant gave evidence that, before he had been interviewed by the police, T. had told him that he, T., knew that the second applicant had not stabbed S. 37.The judge, in his summing up, warned the jury about the danger of relying on the evidence of T. He stated: “That evidence, as you know, was read to you under the provisions that allow a witness who is frightened, it is not a question of nerves it is a question of fright, fear, for his statement to be read to you but you must be careful as to how you treat it. It is right, as has been pointed out by the defence, that they were deprived of an opportunity to test that evidence under cross-examination. It is right also that you did not have the advantage of seeing the witness and his demeanour in court. You did not have the opportunity for him to think back and say ‘possibly because of things I saw I put two and two together and made five’, as counsel for the defence invites you to say. In other words, you must always be alert to [the fact] that he could put things that he did see together and come to the wrong conclusion. That is a way of examining the statement. You must ask yourselves ‘can we rely upon this statement? Is it a statement which we find convincing?’ It is only, if you are satisfied so that you are sure, that what is in the statement has accurately depicted what happened that night and what the witness saw, that you could rely upon it. That goes for any witness. It is only if you find that the evidence is compelling and satisfies you, so that you are sure, that you act upon it. So you must always ask yourselves ‘is the statement he made reliable?’ You must bear in mind also, importantly, that it is agreed and acknowledged that it is not the defendant who is responsible for putting the witness in fear.” 38.On 29 April 2005 the second applicant was convicted by a majority verdict of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, for which he was later sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with a term of fifteen months’ imprisonment for the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice to which he had pleaded guilty. 39.The second applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the inability to cross-examine T. infringed his right to a fair trial. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the Crown accepted that T.’s statement was “both important and probative of a major issue in the case ... had it not been admitted the prospect of a conviction would have receded and that of an acquittal advanced”. The court upheld the reasoning of the trial judge, stating that there was available not only cross-examination of other prosecution witnesses but also evidence from the second applicant himself and the potential for evidence from other bystanders in order to prevent unfairness. It was also stated that the trial judge had explicitly warned the jury in detail as to how they should treat this evidence and properly directed them as to how they should consider it in reaching their verdict. Although the second applicant maintained that even a proper direction by the judge could not cure the unfairness, the Court of Appeal held that the jury was informed of all matters necessary to its decision-making process. Leave to appeal on conviction was refused on 24 January 2006. The Court of Appeal did, however, give the second applicant leave to appeal against his sentence and reduced the sentence of nine years’ imprisonment to seven years’ imprisonment. 40.Hearsay evidence is any statement of fact other than one made, of his own knowledge, by a witness in the course of oral testimony (see paragraph20 of the judgment of Lord Phillips in R. v. Horncastle and others, summarised at paragraphs 57 to 62 below). As a general rule it is inadmissible in a criminal case unless there is a common-law rule or statutory provision which allows for its admission. The relevant statutory provisions applicable to each applicant are set in the following section. Those statutory provisions are supplemented by three common-law principles. Firstly, there is an additional discretion at common law for a trial judge to exclude any evidence if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. This, in turn, is supplemented by section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which provides the court with a discretion to exclude evidence if its admission would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the trial that it ought not to be admitted. Secondly, if hearsay evidence is admitted and the jury have heard it, the trial judge, in his summing up, must direct the jury as to the dangers of relying on hearsay evidence. Thirdly, in a jury trial, the jury must receive the traditional direction as to the burden of proof, namely that they must be satisfied of the defendant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.>Primary legislation applicable in Mr Al-Khawaja’s case 41.At the time of the first applicant’s trial, the relevant statutory provisions were to be found in sections 23 to 28 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”). Section 23 of the 1988 Act provides for the admission of first-hand documentary hearsay in a criminal trial: “23. ... a statement made by a person in a document shall be admissible in criminal proceedings as evidence of any fact of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible if— (2)... (a)... the person who made the statement is dead or by reason of his bodily or mental condition unfit to attend as a witness; ... 25.(1)If, having regard to all the circumstances— (a)the Crown Court— (i)on a trial on indictment; (ii)on an appeal from a magistrates’ court; or (iii)on the hearing of an application under section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 (applications for dismissal of charges of fraud transferred from magistrates’ court to Crown Court); or (b)the criminal division of the Court of Appeal; or (c)a magistrates’ court on a trial of an information, is of the opinion that in the interests of justice a statement which is admissible by virtue of section 23 or 24 above nevertheless ought not to be admitted, it may direct that the statement shall not be admitted. (2)Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) above, it shall be the duty of the court to have regard— (a)to the nature and source of the document containing the statement and to whether or not, having regard to its nature and source and to any other circumstances that appear to the court to be relevant, it is likely that the document is authentic; (b)to the extent to which the statement appears to supply evidence which would otherwise not be readily available; (c)to the relevance of the evidence that it appears to supply to any issue which is likely to have to be determined in the proceedings; and (d)to any risk, having regard in particular to whether it is likely to be possible to controvert the statement if the person making it does not attend to give oral evidence in the proceedings, that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to the accused or, if there is more than one, to any of them. 26.Where a statement which is admissible in criminal proceedings by virtue of section 23 or 24 above appears to the court to have been prepared ..., for the purposes— (a)of pending or contemplated criminal proceedings; or (b)of a criminal investigation, the statement shall not be given in evidence in any criminal proceedings without the leave of the court, and the court shall not give leave unless it is of the opinion that the statement ought to be admitted in the interests of justice; and in considering whether its admission would be in the interests of justice, it shall be the duty of the court to have regard— (i)to the contents of the statement; (ii)to any risk, having regard in particular to whether it is likely to be possible to controvert the statement if the person making it does not attend to give oral evidence in the proceedings, that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to the accused or, if there is more than one, to any of them; and (iii)to any other circumstances that appear to the court to be relevant ...” Schedule 2 to the Act allows for the admission of evidence relating to the credibility and consistency of the maker of the statement, where such evidence would have been admissible had he or she given evidence in person, or where the matter could have been put to him or her in cross-examination. The Schedule also provides that, in estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to such a statement regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to its accuracy or otherwise.>Primary legislation applicable in Mr Tahery’s case (a)The Law Commission’s report 42.In its report of April 1997, entitled “Evidence in Criminal Proceedings: Hearsay and Related Topics”, the Law Commission recommended a series of reforms to the law of hearsay in England and Wales, including the provisions contained in the 1988 Act. In addition to recommending clarification of the conditions under which a witness statement could be admitted at trial (including the existing grounds of death and fear), the Commission proposed that there should be a limited discretion to admit hearsay evidence that did not fall within any other statutory or common-law exception (recommendation 28). In its earlier consultation paper, published in January 1995, the Commission had reviewed the case-law of this Court on Article 6 § 3 (d) and concluded that there was a risk of a breach of the Convention where a person stood to be convicted on hearsay evidence alone. The Commission considered that this risk was sufficiently serious to warrant requiring the trial court to stop the case where hearsay is the only evidence of an element of the offence (paragraph 9.5 of the consultation paper). After criticisms of this proposal (principally that it was unduly cautious and was beset with practical difficulties), in its 1997 report the Commission decided not to maintain its proposal (see paragraphs 5.33-5.41 of the report). It concluded instead that the adequate protection would be provided by the safeguards it proposed, in particular its recommendation 47, which proposed giving the trial judge the power to stop a case if hearsay evidence was unconvincing (see paragraph 45 below). (b)The Criminal Justice Act 2003 (b)The Criminal Justice Act 2003 43.Part 11, Chapter 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”) came into force in April 2005. It was intended to reform substantially the law governing the admission of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings on the basis of the draft bill proposed by the Law Commission. Under section 114 of the 2003 Act, hearsay evidence is only admissible in criminal proceedings if one of a number of “gateways” applies. Although it was not relied upon in the second applicant’s case, one such “gateway” is section 114(1)(d) which allows for the admission of hearsay evidence if the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice for it to be admissible. Section114(2) provides: “In deciding whether a statement not made in oral evidence should be admitted under subsection (1)(d), the court must have regard to the following factors (and to any others it considers relevant)— (a)how much probative value the statement has (assuming it to be true) in relation to a matter in issue in the proceedings, or how valuable it is for the understanding of other evidence in the case; (b)what other evidence has been, or can be, given on the matter or evidence mentioned in paragraph (a); (c)how important the matter or evidence mentioned in paragraph (a) is in the context of the case as a whole; (d)the circumstances in which the statement was made; (e)how reliable the maker of the statement appears to be; (f)how reliable the evidence of the making of the statement appears to be; (g)whether oral evidence of the matter stated can be given and, if not, why it cannot; (h)the amount of difficulty involved in challenging the statement; (i)the extent to which that difficulty would be likely to prejudice the party facing it.” (i)the extent to which that difficulty would be likely to prejudice the party facing it.” 44.The “gateway” relied on in the second applicant’s case was section116, which allows for the admission of statements of absent witnesses. Section 116, where relevant, provides: “(1)In criminal proceedings a statement not made in oral evidence in the proceedings is admissible as evidence of any matter stated if— (a)oral evidence given in the proceedings by the person who made the statement would be admissible as evidence of that matter; (b)the person who made the statement (the relevant person) is identified to the court’s satisfaction; and (c)any of the five conditions mentioned in subsection (2) is satisfied. (2)The conditions are— (a)that the relevant person is dead; (b)that the relevant person is unfit to be a witness because of his bodily or mental condition; (c)that the relevant person is outside the and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance; (d)that the relevant person cannot be found although such steps as it is reasonably practicable to take to find him have been taken; (e)that through fear the relevant person does not give (or does not continue to give) oral evidence in the proceedings, either at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement, and the court gives leave for the statement to be given in evidence. (3)For the purposes of subsection (2)(e) ‘fear’ is to be widely construed and (for example) includes fear of the death or injury of another person or of financial loss. (4)Leave may be given under subsection (2)(e) only if the court considers that the statement ought to be admitted in the interests of justice, having regard— (a)to the statement’s contents; (b)to any risk that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to any party to the proceedings (and in particular to how difficult it will be to challenge the statement if the relevant person does not give oral evidence); (c)in appropriate cases, to the fact that a direction under section 19 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 (c. 23) (special measures for the giving of evidence by fearful witnesses etc.) could be made in relation to the relevant person; and (d)to any other relevant circumstances. (5)A condition set out in any paragraph of subsection (2) which is in fact satisfied is to be treated as not satisfied if it is shown that the circumstances described in that paragraph are caused— (a)by the person in support of whose case it is sought to give the statement in evidence; or (b)by a person acting on his behalf; in order to prevent the relevant person giving oral evidence in the proceedings (whether at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement).” in order to prevent the relevant person giving oral evidence in the proceedings (whether at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement).” 45.By section 121 of the 2003 Act, section 116(2)(e) can only be relied upon in respect of first-hand hearsay; it cannot be relied only to allow the admission of multiple hearsay. In addition, section 124 allows the admission of evidence to challenge the credibility of the absent witness, for example through the admission of evidence of his bad character, including previous convictions, a propensity to be untruthful and so on. It also allows the admission of inconsistent statements that the witness has made. Section 124(2) allows the admission of evidence to challenge the credibility of the absent witness in circumstances where it would not be admissible in respect of a live witness, for example when it relates to a collateral issue in the case. Where a case is based wholly or partly on hearsay evidence, section 125 requires the trial judge to stop the case (and either direct an acquittal or discharge the jury) if, considering its importance to the case against the defendant, the hearsay evidence is so unconvincing that a conviction would be unsafe. This enacted the Law Commission’s recommendation 47 (see paragraph 42 above). Section 126 preserves both the common-law discretion and the section 78 discretion of the trial judge to exclude hearsay evidence (see paragraph 40 above). It also provides a statutory discretion to exclude hearsay evidence if the trial judge is satisfied that “the case for excluding it, taking account of the danger that to admit it would result in undue waste of time, substantially outweighs the case for admitting it, taking account of the value of the evidence”.>The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 46.The conditions under which witnesses can give evidence anonymously in criminal proceedings are now regulated by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (“the 2009 Act”). Formerly, this was regulated by similar provisions in the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008, which was enacted following the House of Lords’ judgment in R. v. Davis (see paragraphs 49 and 50 below). Under the 2009 Act, witnesses can only give evidence anonymously when, upon the application of either the prosecution or a defendant in the proceedings, the trial judge makes a “witness anonymity order”. Section 87 requires that the trial judge be informed of the identity of the witness. Sections 88(2)-(6) and 89 lay down the conditions for the making of a witness anonymity order. In deciding whether those conditions are met, the court must have regard, inter alia, to whether evidence given by the witness might be the sole or decisive evidence implicating the defendant (section 89(2)(c)). 47.Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen. Section 6(1) provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.>R. v. Sellick and Sellick 48.This Court’s judgment in Lucà v. Italy (no. 33354/96, § 40, ECHR 2001II) was considered by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Sellick and Sellick [2005] EWCA Crim 651, which concerned two defendants who were alleged to have intimidated witnesses. Leave was given by the trial judge to have the witnesses’ statements read to the jury. The defendants appealed on the ground that the admission of the statements breached Article 6 § 1 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d). The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. In considering the relevant case-law of this Court, at paragraph 50 of its judgment, it stated that what appeared from that case-law were the following propositions: “(i)The admissibility of evidence is primarily for the national law; (ii)Evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing and as a general rule Article [6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] require a defendant to be given a proper and adequate opportunity to challenge and question witnesses; (iii)It is not necessarily incompatible with Article [6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] for depositions to be read and that can be so even if there has been no opportunity to question the witness at any stage of the proceedings. Article [6 § 3 (d)] is simply an illustration of matters to be taken into account in considering whether a fair trial has been held. The reasons for the court holding it necessary that statements should be read and the procedures to counterbalance any handicap to the defence will all be relevant to the issue, whether, where statements have been read, the trial was fair; (iv)The quality of the evidence and its inherent reliability, plus the degree of caution exercised in relation to reliance on it, will also be relevant to the question whether the trial was fair.” The Court of Appeal then stated: “The question is whether there is a fifth proposition to the effect that where the circumstances justify the reading of the statement where the defendant has had no opportunity to question the witness at any stage of the trial process, the statement must not be allowed to be read if it is the sole or decisive evidence against the defendant. Certainly at first sight paragraph 40 of Lucà seems to suggest that in whatever circumstances and whatever counterbalancing factors are present if statements are read then there will be a breach of Article 6, if the statements are the sole or decisive evidence. Furthermore there is some support for that position in the previous authorities. But neither Lucà nor any of the other authorities were concerned with a case where a witness, whose identity was well-known to a defendant, was being kept away by fear, although we must accept that the reference to Mafia-type organisations and the trials thereof in paragraph 40 shows that the court had extreme circumstances in mind.”>R. v.>R. v. 49.In R. v. Davis [2008] UKHL 36, the House of Lords considered an appeal against conviction by a defendant who had been convicted of two counts of murder by shooting. Three witnesses had given evidence at trial identifying the defendant as the gunman. They gave evidence anonymously, testifying behind a screen so that they could be seen by the judge and jury but not the defendant. The House of Lords unanimously allowed the defendant’s appeal. It found that the witnesses’ testimony was inconsistent with the long-established principle of the English common law that, subject to certain exceptions and statutory qualifications, the defendant in a criminal trial should be confronted by his accusers in order that he may cross-examine them and challenge their evidence, a principle which originated in ancient (Lord Bingham at paragraph 5). Moreover, this Court had not set its face absolutely against the admission of anonymous evidence in all circumstances. However, it had said that a conviction should not be based solely or to a decisive extent on anonymous statements. In any event, on the facts in Davis’s case, this Court would have found a violation of Article 6: not only was the anonymous witnesses’ evidence the sole or decisive basis on which Davis had been convicted, but effective cross-examination had been hampered. Moreover, this Court had not set its face absolutely against the admission of anonymous evidence in all circumstances. However, it had said that a conviction should not be based solely or to a decisive extent on anonymous statements. In any event, on the facts in Davis’s case, this Court would have found a violation of Article 6: not only was the anonymous witnesses’ evidence the sole or decisive basis on which Davis had been convicted, but effective cross-examination had been hampered. 50.Lord Mance, concurring in judgment, considered the relevant authorities of this Court on Article 6. Having done so, he doubted that there was an absolute requirement that anonymous testimony should not be the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant. Instead, the extent to which such testimony is decisive might be no more than a very important factor to balance in the scales. He also considered that R. v. Sellick and Sellick (among other authorities) served as a caution against treating the Convention, or apparently general statements by this Court, as containing absolutely inflexible rules. 51.The Chamber judgment of 20 January 2009 in the present cases was considered by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in R. v. Horncastle and others. The case concerned the appeals of four defendants who had been convicted on the basis of statements of absent victims, which were read at trial under section 116 of the 2003 Act. For two of the defendants, the maker of the statement had died. For another two, the witness was too fearful to attend trial. Their appeals were heard together with that of a fifth defendant, Carter, who had been convicted on the basis of business records, which were introduced at his trial. 52.On 22 May 2009 the Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appeals of the first four defendants ([2009] EWCA Crim 964). It accepted that Article 6 § 3 (d) had a content of its own but, given that it did not create any absolute right to have every witness examined, the balance struck by the 2003 Act was legitimate and wholly consistent with the Convention. There could be a very real disadvantage in admitting hearsay evidence and it needed cautious handling. However, having regard to the safeguards contained in the 2003 Act, which were rigorously applied, there would be no violation of Article 6 if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive degree on hearsay evidence. Where the hearsay evidence was demonstrably reliable, or its reliability could properly be tested and assessed, the rights of the defence would be respected, there would be sufficient counterbalancing measures and the trial would be fair. It was not appropriate that there should be a rule that counterbalancing measures could never be sufficient where the evidence was sole or decisive. This had been considered and rejected by the Law Commission and Parliament when it enacted the 2003 Act. 52.On 22 May 2009 the Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appeals of the first four defendants ([2009] EWCA Crim 964).

This had been considered and rejected by the Law Commission and Parliament when it enacted the 2003 Act. 53.There were also principled and practical difficulties with a sole or decisive rule. Firstly, as a principled difficulty, the test assumed that all hearsay evidence was unreliable in the absence of testing in open court, and secondly, it further assumed that the fact-finder (such as the jury) could not be trusted to assess the weight of the evidence. Neither assumption was justified. For the first, the Court of Appeal gave examples of hearsay evidence that would be reliable such as a victim who, before dying, revealed the name of his or her murderer. For the second, the Court of Appeal found that juries were perfectly able to understand the limitations of written statements and, under section 124 of the 2003 Act, would be provided with material about the maker of the statement (see paragraph 45 above). The mere fact that the evidence was an essential link in the chain of evidence against the accused did not alter that conclusion. For example, forensic evidence might depend on work done by unidentified laboratory assistants (and to that extent was hearsay). However, it was not necessary for every member of the laboratory who had worked with the evidence to be called in order for the strength of the evidence to be tested. 53.There were also principled and practical difficulties with a sole or decisive rule.

However, it was not necessary for every member of the laboratory who had worked with the evidence to be called in order for the strength of the evidence to be tested. 54.The court also found that there were practical difficulties with the sole or decisive rule as a test of admissibility of evidence. It observed: “It is clear from the judgment in Al-Khawaja [v. the United Kingdom] that the [European Court of Human Rights] took the view that the error had lain in admitting the hearsay evidence: see in particular paragraphs 37, 40, 42 and 46. Any test of admissibility must be one which can be applied in advance of the giving of the evidence, let alone of the outcome of the trial. A routine test of admissibility of evidence which can only be applied in retrospect, after the outcome of the trial is known, makes the trial process little more than speculative. Judge, jury, witnesses and parties may find themselves engaged in shadow-boxing without knowing whether the solemn result of the trial will stand to be reversed on the grounds that, as things have turned out, the test of admissibility was not met. Nor can any defendant decide how to conduct his case, and indeed whether or not to plead guilty, if he does not know what evidence can and cannot be relied upon. It will no doubt often be possible to identify in advance a case in which the hearsay evidence in question is the sole evidence against the accused. An obvious case is that of the single eyewitness case, with no suggested support from any other source. But this frequently may not be clear from the outset; there may be other evidence which the prosecution intends to present, but which, on hearing, turns out not to incriminate the accused, or is effectively demolished. Conversely, what appears at the outset to be hearsay evidence standing alone may sometimes come to be supported by other material as the evidence develops. A witness may add something of great significance not previously mentioned, or the significance of something always said may become apparent when apparently unconnected other evidence is given. In any case where there is more than one accused jointly charged, it is common experience that the evidence of one may well shed enormous light upon the guilt or innocence of another. So even the concept of ‘sole’ evidence is an impractical test for admissibility. It is, however, the second limb of the suggested test which is apt to cause the greatest difficulty. No one can know what evidence is decisive until the decisionmaking process is over. On no view can it be possible to rule in advance, at the stage when admissibility is in question, which evidence will be decisive ... The application of the test is made the more difficult yet if the meaning of ‘decisive’ is extended to encompass any evidence of which it can be said that, if it were absent, ‘the prospect of a conviction would have receded and that of an acquittal advanced’ (see paragraph 21 of Al-Khawaja). Indeed, if that is the test of what is decisive, virtually all evidence would qualify; evidence which does not, if accepted by the jury, advance the prospect of conviction will ordinarily be excluded as irrelevant.” The Court of Appeal also observed that the test would also be impossible to apply at a trial of two or more defendants, where one defendant sought to introduce hearsay evidence for his defence. In such a case, the trial judge would be bound to allow the defendant to introduce that evidence even if it might also incriminate one of the other defendants and indeed be decisive evidence against that other defendant. The Court of Appeal also observed that the test would also be impossible to apply at a trial of two or more defendants, where one defendant sought to introduce hearsay evidence for his defence. In such a case, the trial judge would be bound to allow the defendant to introduce that evidence even if it might also incriminate one of the other defendants and indeed be decisive evidence against that other defendant. 55.The Court of Appeal also considered that the safeguard in section125 of the 2003 Act (the power of a trial judge to stop the case if the hearsay evidence is unconvincing; see paragraph 45 above) provided for a “proportionate assessment of the reliability” of hearsay evidence and it would not serve justice if that power were to be trammelled by a requirement that it be exercised in every case in which the hearsay evidence were the sole or decisive evidence. Sole or decisive hearsay could be wholly convincing and, equally, evidence which was neither sole nor decisive might have such a potential influence on the jury that the judge would be persuaded that a conviction was unsafe. Where there was a legitimate argument that that hearsay was unconvincing and important to the case, the trial judge was required to make up his own mind as to whether a conviction would be safe; this involved assessing the reliability of the hearsay evidence, its place in the evidence as a whole, the issues in the case as they had emerged, and all the other individual circumstances of the case. Finally, the other safeguards contained in the 2003 Act were rigorously applied and the difficulties faced by defendants when hearsay was admitted were well understood by the courts. The Act did not equate hearsay with first-hand evidence; on the contrary it required cautious handling. 55.The Court of Appeal also considered that the safeguard in section125 of the 2003 Act (the power of a trial judge to stop the case if the hearsay evidence is unconvincing; see paragraph 45 above) provided for a “proportionate assessment of the reliability” of hearsay evidence and it would not serve justice if that power were to be trammelled by a requirement that it be exercised in every case in which the hearsay evidence were the sole or decisive evidence.

Finally, the other safeguards contained in the 2003 Act were rigorously applied and the difficulties faced by defendants when hearsay was admitted were well understood by the courts. The Act did not equate hearsay with first-hand evidence; on the contrary it required cautious handling. 56.The Court of Appeal also gave guidance as to assessing when it would be appropriate to allow hearsay evidence to be introduced because a witness was in fear. There was, in the case-law of this Court, no requirement that the fear had to be attributable to the defendant, and the essential questions were whether there was a justifiable reason for the absence of the witness supported by evidence and whether the evidence was demonstrably reliable or its reliability could be properly tested and assessed. The Court of Appeal added: “It is, however, important that all possible efforts are made to get the witness to court. As is clear, the right to confrontation is a long-standing requirement of the common law and recognised in Article 6 [§ 3 (d)]. It is only to be departed from in the limited circumstances and under the conditions set out in the [2003 Act]. The witness must be given all possible support, but also made to understand the importance of the citizen’s duty, and indeed that the violent and intimidatory will only flourish the more if that duty is not done, whilst they will normally back down in the face of determination that it be performed. For this reason it is of especial importance that assurances are never given to potential witnesses that their evidence will be read. Unless the defendant consents, it is only the court applying the strict conditions of the [2003 Act] based on evidence that can admit such a statement. Any indication, let alone an assurance, can only give rise to an expectation that this will indeed happen, when if it does the impact of the evidence will be diminished and the disadvantage to the accused may result in it not being given at all. It may well be that in the early stage of police enquiries into a prominent crime the investigators need to seek out information on a confidential basis: that is a matter for practical policing and not for us. But no person who is becoming not simply a source of information but a witness should be told that his evidence will be read, or indeed given any indication whatsoever that this is likely. The most that he can be told is that witnesses are expected to be seen at court, that any departure from that principle is exceptional, and that the decision whether to depart from it is one for the judge and not for the police. In the case before us of Marquis and Graham [two of the appellants], as we set out at paragraphs 127 and 132, the judge found that the investigating police officer had significantly contributed to the fear of the witness by referring repeatedly to a notorious local example of witnesses being hunted down, although relocated, and killed. Although notorious, that incident was an extreme and very unusual case. The need for police officers to tender careful advice to potential witnesses in order to discharge their duty of care towards them should not lead to such frightening information being laboured out of defensiveness. Whilst the [2003 Act] requires fear to be construed broadly, it is not to be expected that fear based upon inappropriate assurances by police officers will result in the evidence being read and the case proceeding on the basis of it to the jury. If the evidence can really only be assessed by the jury by seeing the witness, as will often be the case, it may not be admitted. If it is admitted and central to the case, there is a significant possibility that at the end of the trial the judge may have to rule under [section] 125 that a conviction relying upon it would be unsafe.” (b)The judgment of the Supreme Court 57.On 9 December 2009 the United Kingdom Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment ([2009] UKSC 14). Lord Phillips, giving the judgment of the Supreme Court, found that, although domestic courts were required by the Human Rights Act 1998 to take account of the Strasbourg jurisprudence in applying principles that were clearly established, on rare occasions, where a court was concerned that the Strasbourg judgment did not sufficiently appreciate or accommodate some aspect of English law, it might decline to follow the judgment. The Chamber judgment was such a case. 57.On 9 December 2009 the United Kingdom Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment ([2009] UKSC 14). Lord Phillips, giving the judgment of the Supreme Court, found that, although domestic courts were required by the Human Rights Act 1998 to take account of the Strasbourg jurisprudence in applying principles that were clearly established, on rare occasions, where a court was concerned that the Strasbourg judgment did not sufficiently appreciate or accommodate some aspect of English law, it might decline to follow the judgment. The Chamber judgment was such a case. 58.Lord Phillips considered that a defendant should not be immune from conviction where a witness, who had given critical and apparently reliable evidence in a statement, was unavailable to give evidence at trial through death or some other reason. In analysing the relevant case-law of this Court on Article 6 § 3 (d), Lord Phillips concluded that, although this Court had recognised the need for exceptions to the strict application of Article 6 § 3 (d), the manner in which it approved those exceptions resulted in a jurisprudence which lacked clarity. The sole or decisive rule had been introduced into the Strasbourg case-law in Doorson (cited above) without discussion of the underlying principle or full consideration of whether there was justification for imposing the rule as an overriding principle applicable equally to continental and common-law jurisdictions. Indeed, the rule seemed to have been created because, in contrast to the common law, continental systems of criminal procedure did not have a comparable body of jurisprudence or rules governing the admissibility of evidence. 59.Lord Phillips, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, found that the rule would create severe practical difficulties if applied to English criminal procedure. Firstly, it was not easy to apply because it was not clear what was meant by “decisive”: under English criminal procedure no evidence could be admitted unless it was potentially probative and, in theory, any item of probative evidence could make the difference between conviction and acquittal. Secondly, it would be hard enough to apply that test at first instance but it would be impossible for national appellate courts or this Court to decide whether a particular statement was the sole or decisive basis for a conviction. In a jury trial, the only way the rule could be applied would be to exclude all hearsay evidence. 59.Lord Phillips, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, found that the rule would create severe practical difficulties if applied to English criminal procedure.

In a jury trial, the only way the rule could be applied would be to exclude all hearsay evidence. 60.Lord Phillips also observed: “The sole or decisive test produces a paradox. It permits the court to have regard to evidence if the support that it gives to the prosecution case is peripheral, but not where it is decisive. The more cogent the evidence the less it can be relied upon. There will be many cases where the statement of a witness who cannot be called to testify will not be safe or satisfactory as the basis for a conviction. There will, however, be some cases where the evidence in question is demonstrably reliable. The Court of Appeal has given a number of examples. I will just give one, which is a variant of one of theirs. A visitor to witnesses a hit and run road accident in which a cyclist is killed. He memorises the number of the car, and makes a statement to the police in which he includes not merely the number, but the make and colour of the car and the fact that the driver was a man with a beard. He then returns to his own country, where he is himself killed in a road accident. The police find that the car with the registration number that he provided is the make and colour that he reported and that it is owned by a man with a beard. The owner declines to answer questions as to his whereabouts at the time of the accident. It seems hard to justify a rule that would preclude the conviction of the owner of the car on the basis of the statement of the deceased witness, yet that is the effect of the sole or decisive test.” 61.Lord Phillips instead concluded that the 2003 Act made such a rule unnecessary in English criminal procedure because, if the 2003 Act were observed, there would be no breach of Article 6 § 3 (d) even if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive extent on hearsay evidence. To demonstrate this point, Annex 4 to the judgment analysed a series of cases against other Contracting States where this Court had found a violation of Article 6 § 1 when taken in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d). In each case, had the trial taken place in England and Wales, the witness’s testimony would not have been admissible under the 2003 Act either because the witness was anonymous and absent or because the trial court had not made sufficient enquiries to ensure there was good reason for the witness’s absence. Alternatively, had the evidence been admitted, any conviction would have been quashed on appeal. 61.Lord Phillips instead concluded that the 2003 Act made such a rule unnecessary in English criminal procedure because, if the 2003 Act were observed, there would be no breach of Article 6 § 3 (d) even if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive extent on hearsay evidence.

Alternatively, had the evidence been admitted, any conviction would have been quashed on appeal. 62.Lord Brown delivered a concurring judgment in which he stated: “These appeals are of the utmost importance. If the Strasbourg case-law does indeed establish an inflexible, unqualified principle that any conviction based solely or decisively on evidence adduced from an absent or anonymous witness is necessarily to be condemned as unfair and set aside as contrary to [Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] of the Convention, then the whole domestic scheme for ensuring fair trials – the scheme now enshrined (as to hearsay evidence) in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and (as to anonymous evidence) in the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008 [see paragraph 46 above] – cannot stand and many guilty defendants will have to go free. It is difficult to suppose that the has in fact laid down so absolute a principle as this and, indeed, one exception to it, at least, appears to be acknowledged: the fairness of admitting hearsay evidence from a witness absent as a result of the defendant’s own intimidation. ... Nor can readily be supposed to have intended the sort of practical problems and anomalies identified by the Court of Appeal (paragraphs 61-63 and6871 [of its judgment]) that must inevitably flow from any absolute principle of the kind here contended for. Obviously, the more crucial the evidence is to the proof of guilt, the more scrupulous must the court be to ensure that it can be fairly adduced and is likely to be reliable. In this connection there can be no harm in using the concept of ‘sole or decisive’ so long as it is used broadly – as it is in the 2008 Act with regard to anonymous witnesses and, indeed, in the control order context where it relates rather to the allegations made against the suspect than the evidence adduced in support. Understood and applied inflexibly, however, the concept would involve insoluble problems of detailed interpretation and application. The better view may therefore be that no such absolute principle emerges from the Strasbourg Court’s judgment in Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom ...” 63.Subject to certain statutory exceptions, in Scots criminal law a person cannot be convicted of a crime or statutory offence on the uncorroborated testimony of one witness, however credible (see Morton v. HM Advocate 1938 JC 52, quoted in Campbell v. HM Advocate 2004SLT135). 64.Hearsay is regulated by section 259 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which allows for its admissibility under certain conditions, including when the person who made the statement is dead. Section 259(4) permits evidence to be admitted which is relevant to the credibility of the person as a witness. In N v. HM Advocate 2003 SLT 761 the High Court of Justiciary, sitting as an appeal court, reluctantly reached the conclusion that section 259 deprived the court of the discretion it previously enjoyed at common law to exclude such evidence if it was unreliable. Lord Justice Clerk observed that, notwithstanding section 259, the long-recognised dangers in hearsay evidence remained. He added: “Where a general provision such as [section] 259 applies, there are bound to be cases in the circumstances of which hearsay evidence would be so prejudicial to the fairness of the trial that the only just and proper course would be to exclude it. This, I think, is such a case. I am not impressed by the three safeguards to which the trial judge referred (HMAdvocate v. N, at p. 437C–E). The requirement of corroboration is a neutral consideration. It is a safeguard that applies to prosecution evidence in any form. I cannot see what worthwhile safeguard the principle of corroboration provides if the primary evidence sought to be corroborated is per se unfair to the accused. Moreover, the leading of evidence bearing upon the credibility of the maker of the hearsay statement may be at most an exercise in damage limitation where clearly prejudicial evidence has already been led. As for the safeguard of the judge’s directions, I think that there may be cases where the hearsay evidence is so prejudicial that no direction, however strong, could make adequate amends for the unfairness of its having been admitted. ... In English provisions governing the admissibility of a statement made in a document, Parliament has expressly conferred a discretion on the court to exclude such a statement if it is of the opinion that in the interests of justice it ought not to be admitted. One specific consideration to which the court must have regard is the risk that the admission of the evidence will result in unfairness to the accused (Criminal Justice Act 1988, [sections] 25(1), 25(2)(d) and 26(ii); cf. R. v. Gokal). These, in my view, are prudent provisions. If provisions of this kind had been available to the trial judge in this case, they could have enabled him to exclude the hearsay at the outset.” 65.The High Court of Justiciary also considered the compatibility of the introduction of the evidence of an absent witness with Article 6 § 3 (d) in McKenna v. HM Advocate. In that case, a murder trial, the prosecution sought to introduce statements made to the police by a possible co-accused who had since died. In a previous ruling given before trial (2000 SLT 508), the High Court of Justiciary, sitting as an appeal court, had found that it was only in extreme circumstances that an accused could contend in advance of trial that the introduction of the hearsay evidence would be so prejudicial to the prospects of a fair trial that the court could determine the issue in advance. It therefore allowed the trial to proceed. When the statements were introduced at trial and the accused was convicted, he appealed against his conviction. In its judgment dismissing the appeal (2003 SLT 508), the High Court of Justiciary found that, while the statements were important evidence, having regard to the other evidence led at trial (which included admissions by the accused and forensic evidence), it could not be said that the appellant’s conviction was based to a decisive extent on them. The jury had also been adequately and satisfactorily directed as to how to approach the absent witness’s statement. A similar conclusion was reached by the same court in HM Advocate v. M 2003 SLT 1151. 65.The High Court of Justiciary also considered the compatibility of the introduction of the evidence of an absent witness with Article 6 § 3 (d) in McKenna v. HM Advocate. In that case, a murder trial, the prosecution sought to introduce statements made to the police by a possible co-accused who had since died.

The jury had also been adequately and satisfactorily directed as to how to approach the absent witness’s statement. A similar conclusion was reached by the same court in HM Advocate v. M 2003 SLT 1151. 66.The compatibility of the admission of hearsay evidence with Article6 § 3 (d) was further considered by the High Court of Justiciary in Campbell v. HM Advocate (cited above). The court observed that, in the relevant case-law of this Court, many of the violations of Article 6 § 3 (d) which had been found had arisen in jurisdictions which did not apply the Scots law rule of corroboration: “Most of the situations in which it has been held by the court that there had been a violation of [Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] could not arise in Scotland. Against the requirement for corroboration of all crucial facts, a conviction could not be based solely on the evidence of a single witness, whether in primary or in secondary form. Violations of the Convention right have been established where the principal witness against the accused has not been made available for questioning or, in circumstances where there have been a number of principal witnesses, where none of them has been made so available. No case was cited to us in which a violation was held to have occurred in circumstances where the accused had had an opportunity to question or have questioned the complainer or other direct or central witness and other supporting evidence was in statement form. ‘To a decisive extent’, as used in the European authorities, appears to be concerned with the significance of the evidence as a matter of weight. It is not concerned with any rule that a conviction cannot be based on a single source of evidence. The fact that the hearsay is required to meet the rule about corroboration does not of itself render that hearsay ‘decisive’ in the European sense. In these circumstances we are not persuaded that in every case in which hearsay evidence is a necessary ingredient of the Crown’s corroborated proof there will be a violation of [Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)]. It will, however, be necessary for the trial judge to address, in the context of the whole evidence in the case, the significance of any hearsay evidence relied on by the Crown and to take appropriate action to ensure that the accused’s entitlement to a fair trial is not violated thereby.” 67.The court added that, in directing a jury, the guidance given by the Lord Justice Clerk in the case of N v. HM Advocate (cited above), should be borne in mind. The High Court allowed the appeal of the first appellant in the case of Campbell (cited above) because of the inadequacy of the trial judge’s direction to the jury. It dismissed the second appellant’s appeal in so far as it related to Article 6 of the Convention, finding that the hearsay evidence was not decisive and that the principal evidence against him came from a witness who had testified in court. 68.Campbell was applied in HM Advocate v. Johnston 2004 SLT 1005 where, in a ruling given during the trial, the Lord Ordinary allowed the admission of a witness statement made to the police by a witness who subsequently died before trial; the statement was admissible, inter alia, because it could not be “decisive”. In Humphrey v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC 30, the High Court of Justiciary observed that it had “great difficulty” in understanding the meaning of the word “decisive” in the context of a case based on circumstantial evidence but, in that case, the evidence in the form of a police statement of a witness who had died was not “remotely decisive” and there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction without it. Similar results were reached in Allison v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC 63, and Harkins v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC69. 69.In its March 2010 Consultation Paper on Hearsay in Civil and Criminal Cases, the Law Reform Commission of Ireland provisionally recommended that, subject to existing common law and statutory inclusionary exceptions, hearsay should continue to be excluded in criminal proceedings. It also provisionally recommended that there should be no statutory introduction of a residual discretion to include hearsay evidence and that the concepts of reliability and necessity should not form the basis for reform of the hearsay rule because they lacked clarity. 70.The Commission also noted: “Article 38.1 of the Constitution of Ireland protects the right to cross-examination and that the free admissibility of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings would infringe this constitutionally protected right. There are dangers associated with allowing evidence of unavailable witnesses: it undermines the defendant’s right to a fair trial and creates the potential of miscarriages of justice arising if evidence adduced from the following categories of witnesses is admitted: Where the witness is dead (with the exception of dying declarations); Where a witness because of a bodily or mental infirmity cannot give evidence; Where the witness is outside of the jurisdiction; Where the witness cannot be found.” 71.The Commission declined to recommend that the statutory scheme in England and Wales and in particular section 114 of the 2003 Act, be adopted in . It observed: “This model of reform relaxes the rule in such a manner as to potentially render the rule against hearsay redundant. The categories of admissible hearsay under this model are extended significantly and, in light of the constitutional protection afforded to the right to cross-examination, the Commission is of the provisional opinion that to allow in untested evidence from frightened and unavailable witnesses would undermine this right. The Commission notes that it has provisionally recommended that the courts should retain a discretion to develop the hearsay rule if the necessity exists.” The Commission also found that (subject to possible reservations concerning the ultimate outcome in the present cases), the case-law of this Court appeared broadly in line with the approach taken in Irish law. 72.A strict approach to the exclusion of out-of-court statements has always been taken by the Australian courts (see, for example, Bannon v. The Queen (1995) 185 CLR 1). 73.The admission of hearsay in federal criminal proceedings in is now regulated by the Evidence Act 1995. Section 65 of the Act allows the admission of evidence as to previous representations (for example statements) when a witness is not available to give evidence about an “asserted fact”. Such evidence will be admissible, inter alia, when: (i) the representation was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication (section 65(2)(b)); or (ii) when the representation was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation was reliable (section 65(2)(c)). 74.The use of these provisions to admit the statement of a witness who died before trial was considered by the Federal Court of Australia in Williams v. The Queen (2000) 119 A Crim R 490. The court found that, in the circumstances of the case, the statement made to the police was not sufficiently reliable, particularly when the witness had reasons to tell the police what they wanted to hear. Equivalent statutory provisions were considered by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Harris v. The Queen (2005) 158 A Crim R 454, where the deceased complainant’s statement was found to be sufficiently reliable to be admitted, given that, inter alia, the complainant knew that the police would interview other witnesses in the case. 75.The law of hearsay in Canada has been reformed as a result of three principal decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, which created a “principled approach” to the admissibility of hearsay evidence. 75.The law of hearsay in Canada has been reformed as a result of three principal decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, which created a “principled approach” to the admissibility of hearsay evidence. 76.Firstly, in R. v. Khan [1990] 2 SCR 531, the Supreme Court found that the trial judge had erred in refusing to allow the victim, a three-and-a-half-year-old girl who alleged that she had been sexually assaulted, to give unsworn evidence and his refusal to allow the Crown to introduce statements the child had made to her mother fifteen minutes after the assault. If unsworn evidence could not be given there would be a danger that offences against very young children could never be prosecuted. In respect of the statements to the mother, the Supreme Court found that it was appropriate to take a more flexible but “principled” approach to hearsay. Despite the need for caution, hearsay could be admitted where the two general requirements of necessity and reliability were met. In determining admissibility the trial judge was required to have regard to the need to safeguard the interests of the accused. Concerns as to the credibility of the evidence remained to be addressed by submissions as to the weight to be accorded to it and submissions as to the quality of any corroborating evidence. 77.Secondly, in R. v. Smith [1992] 2 SCR 915 the Court approved the “principled approach” taken in Khan and found that two telephone calls made by the deceased to her mother shortly before her death were admissible. However, the mother’s evidence as to the contents of a third telephone call should have not been admitted as the conditions under which that call was made did not provide the “circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness” which would justify its admission without the possibility of cross-examination. 77.Secondly, in R. v. Smith [1992] 2 SCR 915 the Court approved the “principled approach” taken in Khan and found that two telephone calls made by the deceased to her mother shortly before her death were admissible. However, the mother’s evidence as to the contents of a third telephone call should have not been admitted as the conditions under which that call was made did not provide the “circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness” which would justify its admission without the possibility of cross-examination. 78.Khan and Smith were followed in R. v. Rockey [1996] 3 SCR 829. The Supreme Court was satisfied that any reasonable trial judge would have found it necessary to admit pre-trial statements made by a child, who was fiveyears old at trial, in which he complained that he had been sexually assaulted. It was observed by McLachlin J (concurring in judgment) that the case against the appellant was strong: the child’s statements were entirely consistent and supported, inter alia, by medical evidence and evidence of behavioural changes in him after the assault and the absence of any plausible explanation of someone other than the appellant perpetrating the assault. 79.The third and most significant development in the Supreme Court’s case-law was its judgment in R. v. Khewalon [2006] 2 SCR 787, which took a stricter approach to reliability. The case concerned a complaint of assault made by an elderly resident at a retirement home against one of the home’s employees. The patient, S., gave the police a videotaped statement; the statement was unsworn. After S.’s statement other residents came forward to give statements that they too had been assaulted by the accused. By the time of trial, all those who had made statements, including S, had either died or were no longer competent to testify. Some of the statements were admitted by the trial judge because of the striking similarity between them. The Court of Appeal for excluded all the statements and acquitted the accused. The Supreme Court dismissed the Crown’s appeal from that decision and affirmed the acquittal. The Supreme Court clarified its previous case-law on reliability and stated that the reliability requirement would generally be met by showing: (i) that there was no real concern about whether the statement was true or not because of the circumstances in which it came about; or (ii) that no real concern arose because the truth and accuracy of the statement could nonetheless be sufficiently tested by means other than cross-examination. It was for the trial judge to make a preliminary assessment of the “threshold” reliability of the statement and to leave the ultimate determination of its worth to the fact-finder/jury. All relevant factors had to be considered by the trial judge including, in appropriate cases, the presence of supporting or contradictory evidence. Charron J, giving the unanimous judgment of the court, stated (at paragraph49 of the judgment): “In some cases, because of the circumstances in which it came about, the contents of the hearsay statement may be so reliable that contemporaneous cross-examination of the declarant would add little if anything to the process. In other cases, the evidence may not be so cogent but the circumstances will allow for sufficient testing of evidence by means other than contemporaneous cross-examination. In these circumstances, the admission of the evidence will rarely undermine trial fairness. However, because trial fairness may encompass factors beyond the strict inquiry into necessity and reliability, even if the two criteria are met, the trial judge has the discretion to exclude hearsay evidence where its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.” 80.The court concluded that S.’s statements were not admissible. It observed that the charges against Khelawon in respect of S. were “entirely based” on the truthfulness of the allegations contained in S.’s statements (paragraph 101 of the judgment). The absence of any opportunity to cross-examine him had a bearing on the question of reliability and there were no adequate substitutes for testing the evidence. The principled exceptions to the hearsay rule did not provide a vehicle for founding a conviction on the basis of a police statement, videotaped or otherwise, without more (paragraph 106 of the judgment). Nor could the reliability requirement be met by relying on the inherent trustworthiness of the statement; this was not a case such as Khan where the cogency of the evidence was such that it would be pedantic to insist upon testing by cross-examination. S. was elderly and frail; his mental capacity was at issue and there was medical evidence that his injuries could have arisen from a fall. It was also not clear that he had understood the consequences of his statement for the accused. In the circumstances, S.’s unavailability for cross-examination posed significant limitations on the accused’s ability to test the evidence and, in turn, on the trier of fact’s ability to properly assess its worth. 81.In its report of November 2009, the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong proposed substantial reforms to the admission of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings in that jurisdiction. It proposed that the present rule in Hong Kong against the admission of hearsay evidence should be retained but there should be greater scope to admit hearsay evidence in specific circumstances. The Commission rejected the English statutory scheme contained in the 2003 Act, observing that Hong Kong had none of the statutory mechanisms for excluding hearsay which applied in England and Wales, such as section 126(1) of the 2003 Act and section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (see paragraphs 40 and 45 above). The Commission also observed that grounds for admitting hearsay under section 116 of the 2003 Act, although offering a fair degree of certainty and consistency in decision-making, had “an over-inclusive effect by allowing in all types of relevant evidence, including unreliable hearsay evidence” (paragraph 8.25 of the report). The Commission instead proposed a model of reform, which was based on the approach taken by the New Zealand Law Commission (see paragraph82 below) and the Canadian courts since Khelawon. It recommended that hearsay evidence should be admissible, inter alia, if the trial judge was satisfied that it was necessary to admit the hearsay evidence and that it was reliable. Assessment of reliability by a trial judge should include consideration of whether the hearsay evidence was supported by other admissible evidence. The Commission also recommended that, at any stage of criminal proceedings after hearsay evidence had been admitted, the court should have the power to direct the acquittal of the accused if the trial judge considered that it would be unsafe to convict. In reaching that decision, the court should have regard, inter alia, to the importance of such evidence to the case against the accused. The Commission also found that these recommendations meant that its model of reform would comply with the Chamber judgment in the present cases. 82.The New Zealand Law Commission, in its 1999 Report on Evidence, recommended that the admissibility of hearsay should be based on two considerations: reliability and necessity. That recommendation was enacted in the Evidence Act 2006, which came into force in 2007. Section 18(1) of the Act provides: “A hearsay statement is admissible in any proceeding if— (a)the circumstances relating to the statement provide reasonable assurance that the statement is reliable; and (b)either— (i)the maker of the statement is unavailable as a witness; or (ii)the Judge considers that undue expense or delay would be caused if the maker of the statement were required to be a witness.” (ii)the Judge considers that undue expense or delay would be caused if the maker of the statement were required to be a witness.” 83.“Circumstances” for these purposes are defined in section 16(1) as including: (a) the nature of the statement; (b) the contents of the statement; (c) the circumstances that relate to the making of the statement; (d) any circumstances that relate to the veracity of the person; and (e) any circumstances that relate to the accuracy of the observation of the person. 84.Section 8(1) of the Act provides that evidence must be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the risk that the evidence will (a) have an unfairly prejudicial effect on the proceeding; or (b) needlessly prolong the proceeding. Section 8(2) provides that in determining whether the probative value of evidence is outweighed by the risk that the evidence will have an unfairly prejudicial effect on a criminal proceeding, the judge must take into account the right of the defendant to offer an effective defence. 85.Although jury trials are no longer used in , it too has substantially reformed its law of hearsay. Section 3(4) of the Law of Evidence Amendment Act 45 of 1988 defines hearsay as evidence, whether oral or in writing, the probative value of which depends upon the credibility of any person other than the person giving evidence. By section 3(1) such hearsay evidence is not admissible unless (i) it is admitted by consent; (ii) the person upon whose credibility the evidence depends testifies; or (iii) the court is of the opinion that the evidence should be admitted in the interests of justice. Section 3(1)(c) provides that, in forming its opinion, the court must have regard to: (i) the nature of the proceedings; (ii) the nature of the evidence; (iii)the purpose for which the evidence is tendered; (iv) the probative value of the evidence; (v) the reason why the evidence is not given by the person upon whose credibility the probative value of such evidence depends; (vi)any prejudice to a party which the admission of such evidence might entail; and (vii) any factor which should in the opinion of the court be taken into account. 85.Although jury trials are no longer used in , it too has substantially reformed its law of hearsay. Section 3(4) of the Law of Evidence Amendment Act 45 of 1988 defines hearsay as evidence, whether oral or in writing, the probative value of which depends upon the credibility of any person other than the person giving evidence. By section 3(1) such hearsay evidence is not admissible unless (i) it is admitted by consent; (ii) the person upon whose credibility the evidence depends testifies; or (iii) the court is of the opinion that the evidence should be admitted in the interests of justice. Section 3(1)(c) provides that, in forming its opinion, the court must have regard to: (i) the nature of the proceedings; (ii) the nature of the evidence; (iii)the purpose for which the evidence is tendered; (iv) the probative value of the evidence; (v) the reason why the evidence is not given by the person upon whose credibility the probative value of such evidence depends; (vi)any prejudice to a party which the admission of such evidence might entail; and (vii) any factor which should in the opinion of the court be taken into account. 86.In State v. Ramavhale [1996] ZASCA 14, the Supreme Court observed that, notwithstanding the wording of section 3(1), there remained an “intuitive reluctance to permit untested evidence to be used against an accused in a criminal case”. It also endorsed previous authority that a court should “hesitate long” in admitting or relying on hearsay evidence which plays a decisive or even significant part in convicting an accused, unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. Despite the reforms enacted by section 3(1), the Supreme Court found that reliability was a factor that should continue to be considered in determining the admissibility of hearsay. Moreover, in that case, in assessing what prejudice would arise to the accused if the hearsay were admitted, the trial judge had erred in relying upon the fact that the accused had other avenues open to him to counter the evidence, one of which was to give evidence himself; the logical conclusion of this approach was that the State, by introducing “flimsy” hearsay could force the accused to testify in a case where the absence of direct evidence was such that he would be entitled not to testify. Compelling reasons for admitting hearsay evidence, even though it was decisive, were found to exist in State v. Ndhlovu and others [2002] ZASCA70, not least because the guarantees as to the reliability of the evidence were high and the hearsay evidence interlinked powerfully with the other evidence in the case. The concerns expressed in Ramavhale as to admitting or relying on hearsay evidence which played a decisive or even significant part in convicting an accused were reiterated by the Supreme Court in State v. Libazi and others [2010] ZASCA 91, State v. Mpungose and another [2011] ZASCA 60, and State v. Mamushe [2007] ZASCA 58. In the latter, the Supreme Court observed that it stood to reason that a hearsay statement which would only serve to complete a “mosaic pattern” would be more readily admitted than one which was destined to become a vital part of the State’s case. 87.The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America guarantees the accused in all criminal prosecutions the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him (“the confrontation clause”). In Ohio v. Roberts 448 US 56 (1980) the Supreme Court of the United States of America held that evidence with “particularized guarantees of trustworthiness” was admissible without confrontation. That was overruled in Crawford v.Washington 541 US 36 (2004), where the court ruled that the confrontation clause applied to all evidence which was testimonial in nature and there was no basis in the Sixth Amendment for admitting evidence only on the basis of its reliability. Where testimonial statements were at issue, the only indicium of reliability which was sufficient was the one prescribed by the Constitution: confrontation. Consequently, testimonial evidence was thus inadmissible unless the witness appeared at trial or, if the witness was unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination (see also Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts 129 SCt 2527 (2009), and Bullcoming v. New Mexico 131 SCt 2705 (2011)). The right to confront witnesses will be forfeited if it can be demonstrated that the defendant has frightened the witness into not testifying (see Davis v.Washington 547 US 813 (2006), and Giles v. California 554 US 353 (2008).",2011,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY ASSESSED THE IMPACT THAT THE DEFENDANT’S INABILITY TO EXAMINE A WITNESS HAS HAD ON THE OVERALL FAIRNESS OF HIS TRIAL. IT HAS ALWAYS CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UNTESTED EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DEFENDANT’S RIGHTS HAVE BEEN UNACCEPTABLY RESTRICTED (SEE, AS EARLY EXAMPLES, UNTERPERTINGER, CITED ABOVE, AND BRICMONT V.

GERMANY, NO. 8945/80, COMMISSION DECISION OF 13 DECEMBER 1983, DR 39, P. 43).
AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THE COURT HAS ALWAYS INTERPRETED ARTICLE 6 § 3 IN THE CONTEXT OF AN OVERALL EXAMINATION OF THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS. (SEE, AS A RECENT AUTHORITY, SALDUZ V. TURKEY [GC], NO. 36391/02, § 50, ECHR 2008).
144.  TRADITIONALLY, WHEN EXAMINING COMPLAINTS UNDER ARTICLE 6 § 1, THE COURT HAS CARRIED OUT ITS EXAMINATION OF THE OVERALL FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS BY HAVING REGARD TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE WAY IN WHICH STATUTORY SAFEGUARDS HAVE BEEN APPLIED, THE EXTENT TO WHICH PROCEDURAL OPPORTUNITIES WERE AFFORDED TO THE DEFENCE TO COUNTER HANDICAPS THAT IT LABOURED UNDER AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PROCEEDINGS AS A WHOLE HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED BY THE TRIAL JUDGE (SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, JOHN MURRAY, CITED ABOVE).
145.  ALSO, IN CASES CONCERNING THE WITHHOLDING OF EVIDENCE FROM THE DEFENCE IN ORDER TO PROTECT POLICE SOURCES, THE COURT HAS LEFT IT TO THE DOMESTIC COURTS TO DECIDE WHETHER THE RIGHTS OF THE DEFENCE SHOULD CEDE TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND HAS CONFINED ITSELF TO VERIFYING WHETHER THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED BY THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES SUFFICIENTLY COUNTERBALANCE THE LIMITATIONS ON THE DEFENCE WITH APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS. THE FACT THAT CERTAIN EVIDENCE WAS NOT MADE AVAILABLE TO THE DEFENCE WAS NOT CONSIDERED AUTOMATICALLY TO LEAD TO A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 (SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, ROWE AND DAVIS V. THE UNITED KINGDOM [GC], NO. 28901/95, ECHR 2000II). SIMILARLY, IN SALDUZ (CITED ABOVE, § 50), THE COURT REITERATED THAT THE RIGHT TO LEGAL ASSISTANCE, SET OUT IN ARTICLE 6 § 3 (C) WAS ONE ELEMENT, AMONG OTHERS, OF THE CONCEPT OF A FAIR TRIAL IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 6 § 1.
146.  THE COURT IS OF THE VIEW THAT THE SOLE OR DECISIVE RULE SHOULD ALSO BE APPLIED IN A SIMILAR MANNER. IT WOULD NOT BE CORRECT, WHEN REVIEWING QUESTIONS OF FAIRNESS, TO APPLY THIS RULE IN AN INFLEXIBLE MANNER. NOR WOULD IT BE CORRECT FOR THE COURT TO IGNORE ENTIRELY THE SPECIFICITIES OF THE PARTICULAR LEGAL SYSTEM CONCERNED AND, IN PARTICULAR ITS RULES OF EVIDENCE, NOTWITHSTANDING JUDICIAL DICTA THAT MAY HAVE SUGGESTED OTHERWISE (SEE, FOR INSTANCE, LUCÀ, CITED ABOVE, § 40). TO DO SO WOULD TRANSFORM THE RULE INTO A BLUNT AND INDISCRIMINATE INSTRUMENT THAT RUNS COUNTER TO THE TRADITIONAL WAY IN WHICH THE COURT APPROACHES THE ISSUE OF THE OVERALL FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS, NAMELY TO WEIGH IN THE BALANCE THE COMPETING INTERESTS OF THE DEFENCE, THE VICTIM, AND WITNESSES, AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
(C)  GENERAL CONCLUSION ON THE SOLE OR DECISIVE RULE
(C)  GENERAL CONCLUSION ON THE SOLE OR DECISIVE RULE
147.  THE COURT THEREFORE CONCLUDES THAT, WHERE A HEARSAY STATEMENT IS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST A DEFENDANT, ITS ADMISSION AS EVIDENCE WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY RESULT IN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1. AT THE SAME TIME, WHERE A CONVICTION IS BASED SOLELY OR DECISIVELY ON THE EVIDENCE OF ABSENT WITNESSES, THE COURT MUST SUBJECT THE PROCEEDINGS TO THE MOST SEARCHING SCRUTINY. BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF THE ADMISSION OF SUCH EVIDENCE, IT WOULD CONSTITUTE A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR TO BALANCE IN THE SCALES, TO USE THE WORDS OF LORD MANCE IN R. V. DAVIS (SEE PARAGRAPH 50 ABOVE), AND ONE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS, INCLUDING THE EXISTENCE OF STRONG PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS. THE QUESTION IN EACH CASE IS WHETHER THERE ARE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS IN PLACE, INCLUDING MEASURES THAT PERMIT A FAIR AND PROPER ASSESSMENT OF THE RELIABILITY OF THAT EVIDENCE TO TAKE PLACE. THIS WOULD PERMIT A CONVICTION TO BE BASED ON SUCH EVIDENCE ONLY IF IT IS SUFFICIENTLY RELIABLE GIVEN ITS IMPORTANCE IN THE CASE.
(D)  PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS CONTAINED IN THE 1988 AND 2003 ACTS
148.  THE COURT WILL THEREFORE EXAMINE THE COUNTERBALANCING MEASURES IN PLACE IN ENGLISH LAW AT THE RELEVANT TIME. THE COURT OBSERVES THAT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE 1988 AND 2003 ACTS THE ABSENCE OF WITNESSES MUST BE JUSTIFIED AND FALL WITHIN ONE OF THE DEFINED CATEGORIES (SEE SECTION 23 OF THE 1988 ACT AND SECTION 116 OF THE 2003 ACT AT PARAGRAPHS 41 AND 44 ABOVE). WHATEVER THE REASONS FOR THE ABSENCE OF A WITNESS, THE ADMISSION OF STATEMENTS OF A WITNESS WHO IS NOT ONLY ABSENT BUT ANONYMOUS IS NOT ADMISSIBLE.
MOREOVER, WHERE THE ABSENCE IS DUE TO FEAR, UNDER THE 2003 ACT, THE TRIAL JUDGE MAY ONLY GIVE LEAVE IF HE CONSIDERS THE ADMISSION OF THE STATEMENT TO BE IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE AND HE MUST DECIDE WHETHER SPECIAL MEASURES CAN BE PUT IN PLACE TO ALLOW THE WITNESS TO GIVE LIVE EVIDENCE. IN SUCH A CASE, THE TRIAL JUDGE MUST HAVE REGARD TO THE DIFFICULTY FACED BY THE DEFENDANT IN CHALLENGING THE WITNESS STATEMENT IF THE MAKER OF THE STATEMENT IS NOT CALLED.
149.  THE 2003 ACT ALSO PROVIDES THAT, WHATEVER THE REASON FOR THE ABSENCE OF A WITNESS, EVIDENCE RELEVANT TO THE CREDIBILITY OR CONSISTENCY OF THE MAKER OF THE STATEMENT MAY BE ADMITTED EVEN WHERE THE EVIDENCE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ADMISSIBLE HAD THE WITNESS GIVEN EVIDENCE IN PERSON. THE TRIAL JUDGE RETAINS A SPECIFIC DISCRETION TO REFUSE TO ADMIT A HEARSAY STATEMENT IF SATISFIED THAT THE CASE FOR ITS EXCLUSION SUBSTANTIALLY OUTWEIGHS THE CASE FOR ADMITTING IT. OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE IS THE REQUIREMENT UNDER THE 2003 ACT THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE SHOULD STOP THE PROCEEDINGS IF SATISFIED AT THE CLOSE OF THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION THAT THE CASE AGAINST THE ACCUSED IS BASED “WHOLLY OR PARTLY” ON A HEARSAY STATEMENT ADMITTED UNDER THE 2003 ACT, PROVIDED HE OR SHE IS ALSO SATISFIED THAT THE STATEMENT IN QUESTION IS SO UNCONVINCING THAT, CONSIDERING ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE CASE AGAINST THE ACCUSED, A CONVICTION WOULD BE UNSAFE.
150.  THE COURT ALSO NOTES THAT, IN ADDITION TO THE SAFEGUARDS CONTAINED IN EACH ACT, SECTION 78 OF THE POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT 1984 PROVIDES A GENERAL DISCRETION TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE IF ITS ADMISSION WOULD HAVE SUCH AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FAIRNESS OF THE TRIAL THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE ADMITTED. FINALLY, THE COMMON LAW REQUIRES A TRIAL JUDGE TO GIVE THE JURY THE TRADITIONAL DIRECTION ON THE BURDEN OF PROOF, AND DIRECT THEM AS TO THE DANGERS OF RELYING ON A HEARSAY STATEMENT.
151.  THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THE SAFEGUARDS CONTAINED IN THE 1988 AND 2003 ACTS, SUPPORTED BY THOSE CONTAINED IN SECTION 78 OF THE POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT AND THE COMMON LAW, ARE, IN PRINCIPLE, STRONG SAFEGUARDS DESIGNED TO ENSURE FAIRNESS. IT REMAINS TO BE EXAMINED HOW THESE SAFEGUARDS WERE APPLIED IN THE PRESENT CASES.
4.  THE PRESENT CASES
152.  IN TURNING TO THE PRESENT CASES, THE COURT BEGINS BY OBSERVING THAT, IN THE COURSE OF THE HEARING BEFORE THE GRAND CHAMBER, A QUESTION WAS PUT TO THE PARTIES AS TO WHETHER IT WAS ACCEPTED THAT THE TESTIMONY OF S.T. WAS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE EVIDENCE IN RESPECT OF MR AL-KHAWAJA AND THAT THE TESTIMONY OF T. WAS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE EVIDENCE IN RESPECT OF MR TAHERY. IN REPLY TO THAT QUESTION, THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTED FROM THE POSITION THEY HAD TAKEN BEFORE THE CHAMBER AND SUBMITTED THAT NEITHER S.T. NOR T.’S TESTIMONY WAS SOLE OR DECISIVE (SEE PARAGRAPHS 104 AND 105 ABOVE). THE COURT WILL THEREFORE CONSIDER THREE ISSUES IN EACH CASE: FIRSTLY, WHETHER IT WAS NECESSARY TO ADMIT THE WITNESS STATEMENTS OF S.T. OR T.; SECONDLY, WHETHER THEIR UNTESTED EVIDENCE WAS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE BASIS FOR EACH APPLICANT’S CONVICTION; AND THIRDLY, WHETHER THERE WERE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS INCLUDING STRONG PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT EACH TRIAL, JUDGED AS A WHOLE, WAS FAIR WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 6 §§ 1 AND 3 (D).
(A)  THE AL-KHAWAJA CASE
153.  THE COURT OBSERVES THAT IT IS NOT IN DISPUTE THAT S.T.’S DEATH MADE IT NECESSARY TO ADMIT HER WITNESS STATEMENT IF HER EVIDENCE WAS TO BE CONSIDERED.
154.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE GOVERNMENT’S SUBMISSION THAT S.T.’S STATEMENT WAS NOT SOLE OR DECISIVE BECAUSE THERE WAS OTHER EVIDENCE SUPPORTING IT, THE COURT NOTES THAT THE JUDGE WHO ADMITTED S.T.’S STATEMENT WAS WELL PLACED TO EVALUATE ITS SIGNIFICANCE. HE WAS QUITE CLEAR WHEN HE OBSERVED “NO STATEMENT, NO COUNT ONE” (SEE PARAGRAPH 13 ABOVE). IT IS NOT FOR THE COURT, SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS, TO GAINSAY SUCH AN EVALUATION. THE COURT IS THEREFORE COMPELLED TO CONCLUDE THAT S.T.’S STATEMENT WAS DECISIVE.
155.  NEVERTHELESS, AS THE COURT HAS INDICATED (SEE PARAGRAPH 147 ABOVE) THE ADMISSION OF THE STATEMENT IN EVIDENCE CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS CONCLUSIVE AS TO THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE TRIAL, BUT AS A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR TO BE PLACED IN THE BALANCE ALONGSIDE THE PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS NOTED ABOVE AND OTHER COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS PRESENT IN THE CASE.
156.  THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE WERE OBVIOUSLY IN FAVOUR OF ADMITTING IN EVIDENCE THE STATEMENT OF S.T., WHICH WAS RECORDED BY THE POLICE IN PROPER FORM. THE RELIABILITY OF THE EVIDENCE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT S.T. HAD MADE HER COMPLAINT TO TWO FRIENDS, B.F. AND S.H., PROMPTLY AFTER THE EVENTS IN QUESTION, AND THAT THERE WERE ONLY MINOR INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN HER STATEMENT AND THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY HER TO THE TWO FRIENDS, WHO BOTH GAVE EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THERE WERE STRONG SIMILARITIES BETWEEN S.T.’S DESCRIPTION OF THE ALLEGED ASSAULT AND THAT OF THE OTHER COMPLAINANT, V.U., WITH WHOM THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY COLLUSION. IN A CASE OF INDECENT ASSAULT BY A DOCTOR ON HIS PATIENT, WHICH TOOK PLACE DURING A PRIVATE CONSULTATION WHERE ONLY HE AND THE VICTIM WERE PRESENT, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE OF STRONGER CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN EACH OF THE OTHER WITNESSES WAS CALLED TO GIVE EVIDENCE AT TRIAL AND THEIR RELIABILITY WAS TESTED BY CROSS-EXAMINATION.
157.  IT IS TRUE THAT THE JUDGE’S DIRECTION TO THE JURY WAS FOUND TO BE DEFICIENT BY THE COURT OF APPEAL. HOWEVER, THE COURT OF APPEAL ALSO HELD THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN CLEAR TO THE JURY FROM THAT DIRECTION THAT, IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE APPLICANT’S INABILITY TO CROSS-EXAMINE S.T. AND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO SEE AND HEAR HER, HER STATEMENT SHOULD CARRY LESS WEIGHT WITH THEM (SEE PARAGRAPH 22 ABOVE). HAVING REGARD TO THIS DIRECTION, AND THE EVIDENCE OFFERED BY THE PROSECUTION IN SUPPORT OF S.T.’S STATEMENT, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THE JURY WAS ABLE TO CONDUCT A FAIR AND PROPER ASSESSMENT OF THE RELIABILITY OF S.T.’S ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE FIRST APPLICANT.
158.  AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, AND VIEWING THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS AS A WHOLE, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFICULTIES CAUSED TO THE DEFENCE BY ADMITTING THE STATEMENT AND THE DANGERS OF DOING SO, THERE WERE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS TO CONCLUDE THAT THE ADMISSION IN EVIDENCE OF S.T.’S STATEMENT DID NOT RESULT IN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D).
(B)  THE TAHERY CASE
159.  THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT APPROPRIATE ENQUIRIES WERE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE WERE OBJECTIVE GROUNDS FOR T.’S FEAR. THE TRIAL JUDGE HEARD EVIDENCE FROM BOTH T. AND A POLICE OFFICER AS TO THAT FEAR. THE TRIAL JUDGE WAS ALSO SATISFIED THAT SPECIAL MEASURES, SUCH AS TESTIFYING BEHIND A SCREEN, WOULD NOT ALLAY T.’S FEARS. EVEN THOUGH T.’S IDENTITY AS THE MAKER OF THE INCRIMINATING STATEMENT WAS PUBLICLY DISCLOSED, THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRIAL JUDGE THAT T. HAD A GENUINE FEAR OF GIVING ORAL EVIDENCE AND WAS NOT PREPARED TO DO SO EVEN IF SPECIAL MEASURES WERE INTRODUCED IN THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS PROVIDES A SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION FOR ADMITTING T.’S STATEMENT.

HAD A GENUINE FEAR OF GIVING ORAL EVIDENCE AND WAS NOT PREPARED TO DO SO EVEN IF SPECIAL MEASURES WERE INTRODUCED IN THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS PROVIDES A SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION FOR ADMITTING T.’S STATEMENT.
160.  THE COURT NOTES THAT WHEN THOSE PRESENT AT THE SCENE OF THE STABBING WERE ORIGINALLY INTERVIEWED, NO ONE CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN THE APPLICANT STAB S, AND S HIMSELF HAD NOT SEEN WHO HAD STABBED HIM, ALTHOUGH INITIALLY HE PRESUMED IT WAS THE SECOND APPLICANT. T. HAD MADE HIS STATEMENT IMPLICATING THE APPLICANT TWO DAYS AFTER THE EVENT. HE WAS THE ONLY WITNESS WHO HAD CLAIMED TO SEE THE STABBING. HIS UNCORROBORATED EYEWITNESS STATEMENT WAS, IF NOT THE SOLE, AT LEAST THE DECISIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE APPLICANT FOR THAT REASON. IT WAS OBVIOUSLY EVIDENCE OF GREAT WEIGHT AND WITHOUT IT THE CHANCES OF A CONVICTION WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY RECEDED. EVEN THOUGH THE TESTIMONY MAY HAVE BEEN COHERENT AND CONVINCING ON ITS FACE IT CANNOT BE SAID TO BELONG TO THE CATEGORY OF EVIDENCE THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS “DEMONSTRABLY RELIABLE” SUCH AS A DYING DECLARATION OR OTHER EXAMPLES GIVEN BY THE COURT OF APPEAL AND SUPREME COURT IN THEIR HORNCASTLE AND OTHERS JUDGMENTS (SEE PARAGRAPHS 53 AND 60 ABOVE).
161.  SUCH UNTESTED EVIDENCE WEIGHS HEAVILY IN THE BALANCE AND REQUIRES SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE CONSEQUENTIAL DIFFICULTIES CAUSED TO THE DEFENCE BY ITS ADMISSION. RELIANCE IS PLACED BY THE GOVERNMENT ON TWO MAIN COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS: THE FACT THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE CONCLUDED THAT NO UNFAIRNESS WOULD BE CAUSED BY THE ADMISSION OF T.’S STATEMENT SINCE THE APPLICANT WAS IN A POSITION TO CHALLENGE OR REBUT THE STATEMENT BY GIVING EVIDENCE HIMSELF OR CALLING OTHER WITNESSES WHO WERE PRESENT, ONE OF WHOM WAS HIS UNCLE; AND THE WARNING GIVEN BY THE TRIAL JUDGE TO THE JURY THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO APPROACH THE EVIDENCE GIVEN BY THE ABSENT WITNESS WITH CARE.
162.  HOWEVER, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT NEITHER OF THESE FACTORS, WHETHER TAKEN ALONE OR IN COMBINATION, COULD BE A SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCE TO THE HANDICAP UNDER WHICH THE DEFENCE LABOURED. EVEN IF HE GAVE EVIDENCE DENYING THE CHARGE, THE APPLICANT WAS, OF COURSE, UNABLE TO TEST THE TRUTHFULNESS AND RELIABILITY OF T.’S EVIDENCE BY MEANS OF CROSS-EXAMINATION. THE FACT IS THAT T. WAS THE SOLE WITNESS WHO WAS APPARENTLY WILLING OR ABLE TO SAY WHAT HE HAD SEEN. THE DEFENCE WAS NOT ABLE TO CALL ANY OTHER WITNESS TO CONTRADICT THE TESTIMONY PROVIDED IN THE HEARSAY STATEMENT.
163.  THE OTHER EVIDENCE WAS THAT GIVEN BY THE VICTIM S WHO DID NOT KNOW WHO HAD STABBED HIM, ALTHOUGH INITIALLY HE PRESUMED IT WAS THE APPLICANT. HIS EVIDENCE WAS CIRCUMSTANTIAL IN NATURE AND LARGELY UNCONTESTED BY THE APPLICANT. HE GAVE EVIDENCE OF THE FIGHT AND THE APPLICANT’S ACTIONS AFTER THE STABBING (SEE PARAGRAPH 32 ABOVE). WHILE THIS EVIDENCE CORROBORATED SOME OF THE DETAILS OF T.’S TESTIMONY, IT COULD ONLY PROVIDE AT BEST INDIRECT SUPPORT FOR THE CLAIM BY T. THAT IT WAS THE APPLICANT WHO HAD STABBED S.
164.  IT IS TRUE THAT THE DIRECTION IN THE JUDGE’S SUMMING UP TO THE JURY WAS BOTH FULL AND CAREFULLY PHRASED, DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE DANGERS OF RELYING ON UNTESTED EVIDENCE. HOWEVER, THE COURT DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT SUCH A WARNING, HOWEVER CLEARLY OR FORCIBLY EXPRESSED, COULD BE A SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCE WHERE AN UNTESTED STATEMENT OF THE ONLY PROSECUTION EYEWITNESS WAS THE ONLY DIRECT EVIDENCE AGAINST THE APPLICANT.
165.  THE COURT THEREFORE CONSIDERS THAT THE DECISIVE NATURE OF T.’S STATEMENT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY STRONG CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE MEANT THE JURY IN THIS CASE WAS UNABLE TO CONDUCT A FAIR AND PROPER ASSESSMENT OF THE RELIABILITY OF T.’S EVIDENCE. EXAMINING THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS AS A WHOLE, THE COURT CONCLUDES THAT THERE WERE NOT SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DIFFICULTIES TO THE DEFENCE WHICH RESULTED FROM THE ADMISSION OF T.’S STATEMENT. IT THEREFORE FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D) IN RESPECT OF MR TAHERY.
II.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION
166.  ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION PROVIDES:
“IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION OR THE PROTOCOLS THERETO, AND IF THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTY CONCERNED ALLOWS ONLY PARTIAL REPARATION TO BE MADE, THE COURT SHALL, IF NECESSARY, AFFORD JUST SATISFACTION TO THE INJURED PARTY.”
167.  AS NO VIOLATION HAS BEEN FOUND IN RESPECT OF THE FIRST APPLICANT, JUST SATISFACTION NEED ONLY BE CONSIDERED IN RESPECT OF THE SECOND APPLICANT.
168.  THE SECOND APPLICANT MAINTAINED HIS SUBMISSION THAT, UNLIKE THE MAJORITY OF ARTICLE 6 CASES, IT COULD PROPERLY BE SAID THAT HIS CONVICTION FOR THE OFFENCE IN QUESTION AND HIS SUBSEQUENT SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE VIOLATION. BASED ON THE ADDITIONAL TIME HE SERVED IN PRISON AND WITH REFERENCE TO COMPARABLE DOMESTIC AWARDS FOR UNLAWFUL DETENTION, THE SECOND APPLICANT CLAIMED 65,000 POUNDS STERLING (GBP) (APPROXIMATELY 83,830 EUROS (EUR)). THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THEIR SUBMISSIONS THAT THERE WAS NO CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ALLEGED VIOLATION AND THE CONVICTION OF THE APPLICANT, THAT DOMESTIC CASE-LAW WAS OF LIMITED RELEVANCE AND THAT ANY FINDING OF A VIOLATION AMOUNTED TO SUFFICIENT JUST SATISFACTION. ALTERNATIVELY, A MUCH LOWER SUM, SUCH AS THE EUR 6,000 AWARDED IN VISSER V. THE NETHERLANDS (NO. 26668/95, § 56, 14 FEBRUARY 2002), WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
169.  IN ITS JUDGMENT, THE CHAMBER ACCEPTED THAT DOMESTIC CASE-LAW WAS OF LIMITED RELEVANCE TO THE QUESTION OF NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE IN PROCEEDINGS BEFORE IT. IT FOUND, HOWEVER, THAT THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE SECOND APPLICANT, AT LEAST IN RESPECT OF THE CHARGE WHICH WAS BASED ON T.’S STATEMENT, WAS NOT CONDUCTED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CONVENTION AND THAT THE APPLICANT HAD INEVITABLY SUFFERED A DEGREE OF DISTRESS AND ANXIETY AS A RESULT. IT AWARDED THE SUM OF EUR 6,000 BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE.
170.  THE GRAND CHAMBER SEES NO REASON TO DEPART FROM THE CHAMBER’S ASSESSMENT AND ACCORDINGLY MAKES THE SAME AWARD OF EUR 6,000.
171.  BEFORE THE CHAMBER, THE SECOND APPLICANT CLAIMED A TOTAL OF GBP 7,995 FOR COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY EUR 9,079. THIS COMPRISED GBP 5,571.47 (INCLUSIVE OF VALUE-ADDED TAX (VAT)) FOR APPROXIMATELY 45 HOURS’ WORK BY MS TROWLER, WHICH INCLUDED ATTENDANCE AT THE CHAMBER HEARING AND TRAVELLING TIME TO STRASBOURG. SOLICITOR’S COSTS AND EXPENSES WERE GBP 2,423.56 (INCLUSIVE OF VAT) WHICH COVERED COSTS OF GBP 1,734.16 FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 HOURS’ WORK AND GBP 689.40 IN EXPENSES.
172.  BEFORE THE GRAND CHAMBER, THE SECOND APPLICANT CLAIMED A TOTAL OF GBP 3,614.82 IN RESPECT OF SOLICITOR’S COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH COVERED THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE CHAMBER AND THE GRAND CHAMBER. HE ALSO CLAIMED AN ADDITIONAL GBP 3,643 (INCLUSIVE OF VAT) FOR A FURTHER 37 HOURS’ WORK BY MS TROWLER. THIS INCLUDED 17 HOURS’ WORK TO COVER HER ANTICIPATED ATTENDANCE AT THE GRAND CHAMBER HEARING AND TRAVELLING TIME TO STRASBOURG. SHE WAS, IN THE EVENT, UNABLE TO ATTEND THE HEARING.
173.  THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED THE HOURLY RATES WHICH HAD BEEN CHARGED TO BE EXCESSIVE.
174.  THE COURT FINDS THAT THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED ARE NOT EXCESSIVE IN THE LIGHT OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CASE. THUS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 17 HOURS’ ATTENDANCE AND TRAVELLING TIME TO THE GRAND CHAMBER HEARING (WHICH WERE NOT ACTUALLY INCURRED), THE REMAINDER OF THE SECOND APPLICANT’S COSTS AND EXPENSES SHOULD BE MET IN FULL. IT THEREFORE AWARDS EUR 13,150, INCLUSIVE OF VAT, LESS EUR 1,150 ALREADY RECEIVED IN LEGAL AID FROM THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, TO BE CONVERTED INTO POUNDS STERLING ON THE DATE OF SETTLEMENT.
175.  THE COURT CONSIDERS IT APPROPRIATE THAT THE DEFAULT INTEREST RATE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE MARGINAL LENDING RATE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, TO WHICH SHOULD BE ADDED THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS.
FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT
1.  HOLDS, BY FIFTEEN VOTES TO TWO, THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D) IN RESPECT OF MR AL-KHAWAJA;
2.  HOLDS, UNANIMOUSLY, THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D) IN RESPECT OF MR TAHERY;
3.  HOLDS, UNANIMOUSLY,
(A)  THAT THE RESPONDENT STATE IS TO PAY THE SECOND APPLICANT, MR TAHERY, WITHIN THREE MONTHS, THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS, TO BE CONVERTED INTO POUNDS STERLING AT THE RATE APPLICABLE AT THE DATE OF SETTLEMENT:
(B)  THAT FROM THE EXPIRY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED THREE MONTHS UNTIL SETTLEMENT SIMPLE INTEREST SHALL BE PAYABLE ON THE ABOVE AMOUNTS AT A RATE EQUAL TO THE MARGINAL LENDING RATE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK DURING THE DEFAULT PERIOD PLUS THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS;
4.  DISMISSES, UNANIMOUSLY, THE REMAINDER OF THE APPLICANTS’ CLAIM FOR JUST SATISFACTION.
"
27,001-58287,Grand Chamber,"7.Mr Selmouni, a Netherlands and Moroccan national, was born in 1942 and is currently in prison in Montmédy (France).>On 20 November 1991 the police arrested Géray Tarek, DominiqueKeledjian and Mr Keledjian’s girlfriend in connection with a drug-trafficking investigation, on the instructions of Mr de Larosière, an investigating judge at the Bobigny tribunal de grande instance. DominiqueKeledjian made a voluntary statement, telling the police that he had bought his heroin in Amsterdam from a certain “Gaby”, who had helped him conceal it in order to bring it into France over a number of trips. He gave the police a telephone number in Amsterdam which enabled them to identify the applicant.>On 25 November 1991 Mr Selmouni was arrested following surveillance of a hotel in Paris. After being identified by DominiqueKeledjian and his girlfriend, Mr Selmouni explained that he had had business dealings with Dominique Keledjian in the clothes trade. He denied any involvement in drug trafficking. 10.Mr Selmouni was held in police custody from 8.30 p.m. on 25November 1991 until 7 p.m. on 28 November 1991. He was questioned by police officers from the Seine-Saint-Denis Criminal Investigation Department (“SDPJ 93”) in Bobigny. 11.Mr Selmouni was first questioned from 12.40 a.m. to 1.30 a.m. on 26November 1991 by the police officers against whom he later made a complaint. Having been questioned and taken back to the court cells, MrSelmouni had a dizzy spell. The court cell officers took him to the casualty department at Jean Verdier Hospital in Bondy at 3.15 a.m. The medical observations made by the casualty department read as follows: “Date of examination: 26 November 1991. 3.15 a.m. Attends casualty complaining of assault. On examination, several superficial bruises and injuries found on both arms. Bruises on outer left side of face. Bruise on left hypochondrium. Marks of bruising on top of head. Chest pains increase with deep respiration. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities.” 12.On 26 November 1991 the investigating judge extended police custody by forty-eight hours. Mr Selmouni was questioned from 4.40 p.m. to 5.10 p.m., at 7 p.m., from 8 p.m. to 8.15 p.m. and from 10.25 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. On the same day Mr Selmouni was examined by a Dr Aoustin, who made the following observations: “Bruising to the left eyelid, left arm, lower back. Scalp painful.” 13.On 27 November 1991 Mr Selmouni was questioned from 11 a.m. to 11.40 a.m. On examining him again, Dr Aoustin made the following notes: “Substantial bruising to the left eyelid, left arm, lower back. Bruising to the scalp. Ate nothing yesterday … Complaints forwarded.” 14.After being questioned from 9.30 a.m. to 10.15 a.m. on 28November 1991, Mr Selmouni was again examined by Dr Aoustin, who noted on his medical certificate: “Bruising to the left eyelid, left arm, lower back. Bruising to the scalp. No current treatment.” 15.At 11.30 a.m. on 29 November 1991 the applicant was examined by Dr Edery, a general practitioner. He drew up a certificate, at Mr Selmouni’s request, to the effect that Mr Selmouni claimed to have been assaulted. The certificate stated: “Headaches, bruises under left and right eyes, on left and right arms, back, thorax, left and right thighs and left knee. All areas painful.” 16.On the same day the applicant was brought before the investigating judge, who charged him with offences against the dangerous drugs legislation and remanded him in custody. On Mr Selmouni’s first appearance before the investigating judge, the latter, on his own initiative, appointed Dr Garnier, an expert in forensic medicine on the Paris Court of Appeal’s panel, to examine Mr Selmouni, “who claim[ed] to have been illtreated while in police custody”, and another person, Mr Abdelmajid Madi, arrested on 26 November 1991 and charged with the same offences. 17.On 2 December 1991 the applicant was examined by Dr Nicot from the medical department of Fleury-Mérogis Prison. In a medical certificate drawn up at Mr Selmouni’s request the doctor made the following observations: “… extensive bruising to the trunk and thighs and substantial bruising round the eyes. Presents conjunctival bruises. Says sight impaired in left eye.” 18.On 7 December 1991 Dr Garnier, the expert appointed by the investigating judge, examined the applicant at the prison. Mr Selmouni made the following statement to the doctor: “I was stopped in the street on 25 November 1991 at about 9 a.m. There were no problems at that stage. I was taken to the hotel where I was living. One of the six plain-clothes policemen then hit me in the area of my left temple. I was then taken to Bobigny police station. At about 10 a.m. I was taken up to the first floor, where about eight people started hitting me. I had to kneel down. One police officer pulled me up by my hair. Another policeman hit me repeatedly on the head with an instrument resembling a baseball bat. Another one kept kicking and punching me in the back. The interrogation continued non-stop for about an hour. In the night I asked to be examined. I was taken to hospital, where I had head and chest X-rays. I was hit again at about 9 p.m. the following day during a further interrogation and this went on until 2 a.m. When I arrived at Fleury, I underwent a medical examination.” 19.The doctor noted in his report: – “sub-orbital haematoma extending 2 cm below the left lower eyelid, purplish, almost completely healed, – thin linear scar, approximately 1 cm long, continuing the line of the left eyebrow, – one right sub-orbital haematoma, almost completely healed, – multiple skin abrasions (six of which are large), almost completely healed, on the left arm, – two 5 cm linear skin abrasions – possibly scratches – on the right arm, – 0.5 cm skin lesion on the back of the right hand, – haematoma on the back of the thorax, over the right shoulder blade, – one haematoma on the right side, – severe (10 cm by 5 cm) haematoma on the left side of the thorax, – three haematomas on the left side, – severe (5 cm by 3 cm) haematoma on the front of the thorax, purplish, in the epigastric region, – haematoma in the right prehepatic region, – haematoma on the left of the ribcage 5 cm below the nipple, – 5 cm by 3 cm haematoma on the left side on the axillary line, – haematoma in the right subclavian region, – haematoma on the right buttock, – 10 cm by 5 cm haematoma on the left buttock, – 5 cm by 1 cm linear haematoma on the outer front part of the left thigh, – skin abrasion corresponding to a wound, now healing, on the front of the right ankle, – swelling on the back of the right foot and a skin abrasion on the back of the foot, – five superficial wounds, now healing, on the lower front part of the right leg, – skin abrasions and bruised swelling on the back of the first two metacarpals of the left hand. The patient states that on his arrival at Fleury he was treated with skin cream and given painkillers. No injuries to the scalp or left eyeball …” 20.The conclusion of the report is as follows: “CONCLUSION Mr Selmouni states that he was subjected to ill-treatment while in policy custody. He presents lesions of traumatic origin on his skin that were sustained at a time which corresponds to the period of police custody. These injuries are healing well.” 21.That report was attached to the investigation file opened in respect of the applicant. On 11 December 1991 the investigating judge sent it to the public prosecutor’s office. 22.In an order of 8 September 1992 the investigating judge committed the applicant for trial at the Criminal Court and ordered him to be kept in detention on remand. 23.On 17 February 1992 the public prosecutor’s office at the Bobigny tribunal de grande instance instructed the National Police Inspectorate to question the police officers concerned. 24.When questioned at Fleury-Mérogis Prison by an officer of the National Police Inspectorate on 1 December 1992, the applicant confirmed his earlier statement as follows: “… At about 8.30 p.m. on 25 November 1991 I was arrested in the vicinity of my hotel, the Terminus Nord, near the Gare du Nord in Paris by two or three plain-clothes policemen. They pushed me against a wall while pressing the barrels of two guns against my neck. I offered no resistance to my arrest and did not struggle. You remind me that during questioning on 27 November 1992 I admitted that I had attempted to escape arrest. I dispute that. First of all, I maintain that I did not make such a statement to the police officer who questioned me and, moreover, I signed the records of interview without having read them. The policeman told me on my release from police custody that he had got me to sign that I had resisted arrest and that they were covered. I was alone when I was arrested and immediately afterwards I was taken to my hotel room, which was searched in my presence. Two other policemen were already there. While they were searching my room, the youngest police officer of the group punched me on the left temple. When they had finished searching my room I was taken to the Drugs Squad station in Bobigny and to an office on the first or second floor. After I had been subjected to a body search, during which everything in my possession was taken, my interrogation by five police officers began. One of them, who appeared to be in charge, made me kneel on the floor and began pulling my hair while another one hit me in the ribs with a stick resembling a baseball bat. He then kept tapping me on the head with the bat. The three other police officers were also actively involved, punching me and some of them standing on my feet and crushing them. I seem to recall arriving at Bobigny police station at about 10 p.m. The treatment I have described continued until 1 a.m. Following that first interrogation I was handed over to uniformed policemen on the ground floor of the building in which I was detained. As my ribs and head were hurting from the blows I had received, I informed these policemen and was taken in the night to a hospital in the area, but cannot say which one. There I underwent several examinations, including X-rays, and was later taken to a police station, but not the one to which I had first been taken. The uniformed police officers treated me decently. The following morning, before being questioned a second time, I was examined on the premises of the Drugs Squad by a doctor, who was able to see the marks on my body caused by the policemen’s brutality. On 26 November 1992 I was questioned again by several police officers – three or four – at some point in the day. I believe it was at about 10 a.m. On that occasion they pulled my hair, punched me and hit me with a stick. In the evening of the same day, when there were fewer staff on the first floor, I was questioned again by six police officers, who were particularly brutal to me. I was punched, and beaten with a truncheon and a baseball bat. They all carried on assaulting me until 1 a.m. I think that this session of ill-treatment had begun at about 7p.m. At one point they made me go out into a long office corridor where the officer I presumed was in charge grabbed me by the hair and made me run along the corridor while the others positioned themselves on either side, tripping me up. They then took me into an office where a woman was sitting and made me kneel down. They pulled my hair, saying to this woman ‘Look, you’re going to hear somebody sing’. I remained there for about ten minutes. I cannot describe this woman to you, but she looked young. I was then taken back out into the corridor, where one of the police officers took out his penis and came up to me saying ‘Here, suck this’; at that point I was on my knees. I refused, keeping my mouth closed because he had brought his penis up to my lips. When I refused, that officer urinated over me at the suggestion of one of his colleagues. After that, I was taken to an office and threatened with burns if I did not talk. When I refused, they lit two blowlamps which were connected to two small blue gas-bottles. They made me sit down and placed the blowlamps about one metre away from my feet, on which I no longer had shoes. At the same time they were hitting me. Following that ill-treatment, they brandished a syringe, threatening to inject me with it. When I saw that, I ripped open my shirt-sleeve, saying ‘Go on, you won’t dare’; as I had predicted, they did not carry out their threat. My reaction prompted a fresh outburst of violence from the policemen and I was illtreated again. The police officers left me in peace for about fifteen minutes, then one of them said ‘You Arabs enjoy being screwed’. They took hold of me, made me undress and one of them inserted a small black truncheon into my anus. NB. When Mr Selmouni relates that scene, he starts crying. I am aware that what I have just told you is serious, but it is the whole truth, I really did suffer that ill-treatment. After the sexual assault, I was put into a cell again. The next day I was examined by a doctor, who was able to observe my condition. I had informed the doctor that the policemen had been assaulting me and I had even asked him to tell them to stop torturing me. The violence I have just described was committed during the nights of 25 to 26 and 26 to 27 November 1991. Thereafter, until I was brought before the investigating judge, I was occasionally punched. Before bringing me before the investigating judge, the policemen were very kind, even going so far as to offer me coffee. When I signed the papers concerning my belongings, I noticed that 2,800 guilders and a Dupont lighter had disappeared. I informed a policeman about this – the one I thought was in charge – who replied ‘Shit, again’, and the matter was left at that. The lighter bears the initials A.Z. I can identify the six policemen who hit me. I can also describe the part played by each one. The officer in charge is slightly balding. The one who showed me his penis and then sodomised me with a truncheon is of medium height, fairly thickset, aged 30 to 35, and fair-haired. As soon as I was brought before the investigating judge, I told him that I had been assaulted, and a few days later I was examined at the prison. However, on the actual day I was brought before the investigating judge I had seen a doctor at the Bobigny law courts. I have had a lawyer for one month and have informed him of the manner in which I was treated while in police custody. When I arrived at the prison, the marks left by the assault were all over my body. I now have trouble with my eyes. I am lodging a complaint against the policemen.” 25.The record of the interview was sent to the Bobigny public prosecutor on 2December 1992 as part of the proceedings numbered B.92.016.5118/4. 26.In a judgment of 7 December 1992 the Thirteenth Division of the Bobigny Criminal Court sentenced the applicant to fifteen years’ imprisonment and permanent exclusion from French territory and, as to the civil action by the customs authorities, ordered him to pay, jointly and severally with his co-accused, an aggregate sum of twenty-four million French francs. In a judgment of 16 September 1993 the Paris Court of Appeal reduced the prison sentence to thirteen years and upheld the remainder of the judgment. On 27 June 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal. 27.Mr Selmouni attended Hôtel-Dieu Hospital for treatment at regular intervals during his detention. 28.On 1 February 1993 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint together with an application to join the criminal proceedings as a civil party with the senior investigating judge at the Bobigny tribunal de grande instance for “assault occasioning actual bodily harm resulting in total unfitness for work for more than eight days; assault and wounding with a weapon (namely a baseball bat); indecent assault; assault occasioning permanent disability (namely the loss of an eye); and rape aided and abetted by two or more accomplices, all of which offences were committed between 25 and 29 November 1991 by police officers in the performance of their duties”. 29.On 22 February 1993, in the proceedings numbered B.92.016.5118/4, the Bobigny public prosecutor requested that an investigation be opened into the complaint lodged by Mr Selmouni and a similar complaint lodged by a co-defendant, Mr Madi, concerning offences committed by a person or persons unknown of assault and wounding, with a weapon, of a defenceless person and indecent assault. The complaint lodged by the applicant on 1February 1993 was registered on 15 March 1993. These new proceedings were given the reference number B.93.074.6000/9. 30.On 27 April 1993 Mrs Mary, the investigating judge at the Bobigny tribunal de grande instance to whom the case had been allocated, issued formal instructions to the Director of the National Police Inspectorate to take all necessary steps to establish the truth. She set 15 June 1993 as the date for filing his reports. 31.On 9 June 1993 Dr Garnier re-examined Mr Selmouni, at MrsMary’s request. In his report, which he filed on 21 June 1993, he made the following observations: “When I first examined Mr Selmouni, he stated that he had been assaulted while in police custody. He has told me today that he did not mention the sexual assault on that occasion because he felt ashamed of it. An examination of the anal sphincter does not reveal any lesion such as to corroborate or invalidate the patient’s statements, mainly owing to the amount of time which has elapsed since the alleged acts. The somatic lesions recorded in the previous medical certificate are healing well with no complications. As regards the alleged sexual assault, in the absence of any functional repercussion or visible injury, no sick-leave on grounds of total unfitness for work [‘ITTP’] is necessary as a direct result of the alleged acts. TOTAL UNFITNESS FOR WORK The lesions recorded in the first medical certificate and observed when I prepared my first expert report are traumatic lesions with no serious features (haematomas and bruises) and necessitate an ITTP of 5 days. CONCLUSION Mr Selmouni states that he was sexually assaulted and beaten while in police custody. The traumatic lesions necessitated an ITTP of 5 days. The patient states that his sight in his left eye is impaired. An examination by an eye specialist is necessary if a causal link with the alleged acts is to be established. As regards the sexual assault, in the absence of any visible injury and any functional repercussions, an ITTP is not necessary.” 32.In an order of 15 June 1993 the investigating judge decided to join the two complaints relating to the same offences under the single reference B.92.016.5118/4. 33.She interviewed the applicant on 14 May 1993, instructed an expert on 9 June 1993 and served the parties with the expert’s medical report on 15September 1993. 34.On 7 July 1993 the applicant sent the investigating judge a copy of the medical certificates of 29 November and 2 December 1991 and reiterated the terms of his complaint. 35.In a letter of 3 September 1993 to the President of the Tenth Division of the Paris Court of Appeal, which was to hear the applicant’s appeal against his conviction for offences against the dangerous drugs legislation, the applicant said that he had been raped with the baseball bat and added that a police officer had urinated over him. The applicant stated that, before sending that letter, he had also informed the President of the thirteenth division of the Bobigny Criminal Court of the ill-treatment inflicted on him while he was in police custody. 36.In a formal instruction of 8 October 1993 the investigating judge reiterated her request of 27 April 1993 as the 15 June 1993 time-limit for sending in the police inspectorate’s reports had not been complied with. She also ordered Mr Selmouni’s medical files to be seized at Fresnes Prison Hospital, Fleury-Mérogis Prison and Hôtel-Dieu Hospital. 37.The investigating judge interviewed the civil parties again on 6December 1993, after receiving on 2 December 1993 the evidence taken by the police inspectorate on her instructions. On 26 January 1994 a lawyer was officially appointed to represent the applicant under the legal aid scheme. In letters of 23 June and 27 October 1994 the lawyer in question told the applicant that she was having difficulties obtaining a visiting permit. 38.The civil parties were interviewed again on 10 February 1994, on which date an identity parade was organised in order to identify the police officers against whom the allegations had been made. Mr Selmouni picked out four police officers from the ten who took part in the identity parade. They were Mr Jean-Bernard Hervé, Mr Christophe Staebler, MrBrunoGautier and Mr Patrice Hurault. 39.With a view to charging the police officers identified by the civil parties, the investigating judge sent the case file to the public prosecutor’s office on 1 March 1994. 40.The Bobigny public prosecutor referred the case to the Paris Principal Public Prosecutor who, in turn, referred it to the Court of Cassation. 41.In a judgment of 27 April 1994 the Court of Cassation decided to remove the case from the Bobigny investigating judge and transfer it to a judge of the Versailles tribunal de grande instance, in the interests of the proper administration of justice. On 21 June 1994 the public prosecutor at the Versailles tribunal de grande instance reopened the investigation, under the reference V.94.172.0178/3, into offences of “assault by public servants occasioning total unfitness for work for more than eight days and sexual assault by several assailants or accomplices, against any persons identified as a result of the investigation”. 42.On 22 June 1994 the case was allocated to Mrs Françoise Carlier-Prigent, the Vice-President of the Versailles tribunal de grande instance in overall charge of judicial investigations. 43.On 8 August 1994 the investigating judge requested that both of MrSelmouni’s medical files that had been placed under seal by the National Police Inspectorate be sent to her. The sealed documents were sent to her on 12April 1995. 44.On 19 September 1995 Mr Selmouni underwent an operation on his left eye at Hôtel-Dieu Hospital. 45.In an order of 22 September 1995 the investigating judge appointed an eye specialist, Dr Biard, to examine Mr Selmouni. 46.On 5 January 1996 the medical expert was granted an extension of time in which to file his report. He filed it on 18 January 1996. In it he made the following findings: “1. Mr Selmouni’s eyesight has deteriorated since he was operated on in September 1995. It cannot be said with certainty that it really deteriorated between 25 November 1991 and the end of September 1995.> The assault of which he complains, namely the blows to the left periorbital region of his face, could have caused eye injuries, but apart from subjective symptoms of metamorphopsia, or even reduced vision, and of an isolated problem with the epiretinal membrane, no mark on the eye, in particular the anterior chamber, has ever been found, nor has any sign of haemorrhaging in the retina occurring contemporaneously with the blows complained of and enabling a link to be established between them. However, signs of degeneration were found in relation to a constitutional disorder (short-sightedness in both eyes).” 47.On 6 February 1996 the medical report was served on Mr Selmouni, who also gave evidence. He maintained his allegations against the four police officers he had named. On 7 March 1996 evidence was also heard from the other civil party, Mr Madi. Mr Madi named a fifth police officer, Mr Alexis Leclercq. 48.In a letter of 2 May 1996 the investigating judge asked the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department (“CID”) for the names and addresses of the police officers against whom the complaints had been filed. He replied on 23 May 1996. 49.On 21 October 1996 the investigating judge officially informed the five police officers implicated by the applicant that they were being placed under investigation. 50.The five police officers against whom Mr Selmouni and Mr Madi had lodged their complaints, namely Mr Hervé, Mr Staebler, Mr Gautier, MrLeclercq and Mr Hurault, were questioned on their first appearance on 10, 24 and 31 January, 28 February and 7 March 1997. They were placed under investigation for assault by public servants occasioning total unfitness for work for more than eight days. Mr Hervé, Mr Staebler, Mr Gautier and Mr Hurault were also placed under investigation for sexual assault committed by a number of assailants or accomplices. 51.On 24 April 1998, in view of the denials by the police officers, who maintained that a “struggle” had ensued when Mr Selmouni was arrested, the investigating judge appointed Dr Garnier as expert again, instructing him to examine all Mr Selmouni’s medical files and certificates and give his opinion as to whether the injuries found could have been caused in a “struggle” when he was arrested at approximately 8.30 p.m. on 25November 1991 or whether they supported the applicant’s allegations. 52.On the same day the applicant requested that a number of investigative measures be carried out, including a further confrontation between witnesses and further medical reports in order to determine the damage he had suffered, and an inspection by the judge of the premises on which he had been held in police custody. In an order of 7 May 1998 the investigating judge dismissed the requests, on the ground that some of them had been partly satisfied. 53.On 4 June 1998 a confrontation was held between the applicant and the four police officers. He described the part each of them had played while he had been in their custody. 54.Dr Garnier’s report was filed on 3 July 1998. The expert concluded his report in the following terms: “An examination of the medical file shows that doctors found a progression of injury marks on the patient’s body during the period in police custody. A number of them could certainly have been caused during a ‘struggle’ when the patient was arrested at approximately 8.30 p.m. on 25 November 1991, as described by the CID officers in question. The injuries, particularly those on the lower limbs and buttocks, which were not seen on the first examination, would certainly have been sustained after that arrest and support the patient’s statements. As regards the acts of sodomy described by the patient, the negative result of the test carried out on 9 June 1993, that is one and a half years after the initial facts, neither disproves nor proves that they occurred.” 55.On 25 August 1998 the investigating judge served notice on MrSelmouni that the investigation was complete. The investigation file was sent to the public prosecutor’s office on 15 September 1998. 56.On 19 October 1998 the public prosecutor submitted his written statement of how he wished the investigating judge to proceed with the case. He submitted, inter alia: “ … the denials by the police officers concerned do not stand up to examination any more than does their reference to a ‘struggle’ when effecting the arrest or to forceful resistance during questioning. The absence of any variation or inconsistency in the statements made by AhmedSelmouni and Abdelmajid Madi justifies taking them into consideration. They are, moreover, corroborated by medical findings and therefore amount to sufficient evidence against the five persons in question for the allegations to be examined by the trial court …” 57.In an order of 21 October 1998 the investigating judge committed the five police officers in question for trial at the Versailles Criminal Court. In respect of Mr Selmouni’s allegations, the judge committed the four police officers concerned for trial at that court on charges of assault occasioning total unfitness for work for less than eight days and indecent assault committed collectively and with violence and coercion. 58.The trial was held at the Versailles Criminal Court on 5February 1999. The applicant filed pleadings in support of an objection that the court had no jurisdiction to try the case and that it should be transferred to the Assize Court. He submitted that the sexual assault had in fact been rape; that he had been the victim of assault occasioning permanent disability, namely loss of visual acuity, committed by public servants; and, lastly, that the illtreatment he had suffered should be classified as acts of torture inflicted before or during the commission of a crime. The court joined that objection to the merits. At the end of the trial the public prosecutor requested that MrHervé be sentenced to four years’ imprisonment and Mr Staebler, MrHurault and Mr Gautier to three years’ imprisonment. The Criminal Court reserved judgment until 25 March 1999. 59.In a judgment of 25 March 1999 the Versailles Criminal Court dismissed the objection to jurisdiction raised by Mr Selmouni, on the following grounds in particular: (a)as to classification of the sex offence as rape: “ … The Court must, however, conclude that neither the medical certificates nor the expert reports support the allegation of anal penetration. Furthermore, Selmouni was unable to identify the police officer who had allegedly raped him. Accordingly, the offence cannot be classified as rape.” (b)as to classification of the assault as assault occasioning permanent disability: “ … The Court observes that the expert report prepared by Dr Biard does not allow a causal link to be established between Mr Selmouni’s loss of visual acuity and the blows he received. This point of his objection therefore cannot be allowed.” (c)as to classification of the ill-treatment as acts of torture inflicted before or during the commission of a crime: “Apart from the fact that those acts were not so classified in the former Criminal Code applicable at the material time, in the instant case the acts of violence inflicted on Ahmed Selmouni which he alleges should be classified as acts of torture or barbarism were not inflicted before or during the commission of a crime. The Court therefore considers that the acts in question cannot be classified as a crime …” 60.In determining whether or not the police officers were guilty, the Criminal Court noted that “two completely contradictory arguments [had been] submitted to it” and decided to examine “in turn” “a number of explanations” given by the police officers. Assuming that “it [had been] established … that [the applicant’s] injuries [had been] caused during – or within a very short time before or after – police custody”, the court considered that the attempts made by the civil parties to resist arrest did not suffice to explain the extent of the injuries found; that the “inconsistencies”, if any, in the civil parties’ statements were not decisive and that, in general, “the civil parties had been consistent in their account of events and the timing of them”; that even where there is strong evidence, “any police officer knows well that a confession is preferable and very difficult for a defendant to contest later”; and that “there [was] ample evidence to disprove the allegation that the civil parties [had] conferred when filing their complaints against the police officers”. 61.The Versailles Criminal Court found that “the evidence gathered during the investigation and produced at the trial show[ed] that events [had] indeed occur[red] in the manner described by the victims” and convicted the police officers of the offences charged. The court considered itself bound to “apply the criminal law in a way that [would] serve as an example to others” and sentenced Mr Hurault, Mr Gautier and Mr Staebler to three years’ imprisonment. With regard to the fourth police officer, the court held: “ … in his capacity as Detective Chief Inspector in charge of the group of police officers, Bernard Hervé was responsible for the methods used to conduct the investigation under his control and direction. In addition, he had been directly involved in the assault since he had pulled the civil parties’ hair. The civil parties had unequivocally identified him as the officer in charge. The Court therefore deems it necessary to punish Bernard Hervé more severely for his actions and sentences him to four years’ imprisonment. As Mr Hervé is still in a position of responsibility, it is necessary, as a matter of public policy, that sentence be executed immediately. The Court issues a warrant for Bernard Hervé’s arrest.” 62.The Versailles Criminal Court declared admissible Mr Selmouni’s application to join the proceedings as a civil party. It noted that he had not quantified his claims for damages and that he had reserved the right to apply to the civil courts. 63.The police officers appealed. 64.In a judgment of 8 April 1999 the Versailles Court of Appeal dismissed an application for release made by Mr Hervé, on the following grounds: “… the offences in question, because of their exceptionally serious nature having regard to the status of senior police officer [officier de police judiciaire], responsible for enforcing the laws of the Republic, possessed by the accused, who was convicted at first instance, have resulted in serious and continuing prejudice to public order …” 65.In a judgment of 1 July 1999, following hearings on 20 and 21 May 1999, after which Mr Hervé was released, the Versailles Court of Appeal acquitted the policemen for lack of evidence on the charge of indecent assault, but held them to be guilty of “assault and wounding with or under the threat of the use of a weapon, occasioning total unfitness for work for less than eight days in the case of Selmouni and more than eight days in the case of Madi, by police officers in the course of their duty and without legitimate reason”. It sentenced Mr Hervé to eighteen months’ imprisonment, of which fifteen months were suspended, Mr Gautier and MrStaebler to fifteen months’ imprisonment suspended and Mr Hurault to twelve months’ imprisonment suspended. The Court of Appeal gave, inter alia, the following reasons for its decision: “As to guilt As to the assaults In absolute terms the word of a policeman, a fortiori that of a senior one [officier de police judiciaire] is more credible than that of a drug trafficker. That premiss, however, is weakened, and even made unsound, where statements by offenders are supported by external evidence such as medical findings. It is put even more in doubt where the explanations provided by the policemen vary significantly during the course of the proceedings; and the presumption in favour of the police is destroyed if it is shown, as in the instant case, that the police reports do not reflect the truth. As to the medical findings The accusations made by the civil parties are supported by unequivocal medical findings. In the first place, as regards Selmouni, the expert Professor Garnier noted in his report of 5 May 1998 that all the doctors who had examined him while he was in police custody had found lesions of traumatic origin on the left arm, in the left orbital region, on the scalp and on the back. On 29 November 1991 further lesions were seen on the lower limbs. He added that during his examination on 7 December 1991 he had again found lesions that had been described earlier and that he found others on the buttocks and on the right ankle. The extent of the injuries on Selmouni’s person increased as the uninterrupted police custody continued. The bruising to the left eyelid, the thin linear scar one centimetre long continuing the line of the left eyebrow, the left and right sub-orbital haematomas found on 29November 1991 by Dr Edery, and then described on 2 December 1991 by Dr Nicot as being ‘round the eyes’, are consistent with the punching mentioned by Selmouni. The various haematomas found on the thorax, the left and right sides and the abdomen are consistent with the punching and kicking in his statement of 7 December 1991. The pain in the scalp and the headaches mentioned by Drs Aoustin and Edery are likewise of a kind to support Selmouni’s statements, according to which his hair was pulled and he was repeatedly tapped on the head with an instrument which could have been a baseball bat. The haematomas found on the buttocks and the thighs could only have come from blows from a blunt instrument. Similarly, the lesions apparent on the legs, ankles and feet are consistent with the blows or crushing that Selmouni complained of. It follows from the foregoing that the objective injuries, as recorded in successive examinations, match the blows described by Selmouni. As regards Madi, the medical certificates and the expert medical opinions attest to the reality and intensity of the blows he sustained. Further, as set out by the expert, the time that elapsed between the appearance of the objective injuries and the events in issue strongly suggests repeated small injuries. The scalp abrasions are absolutely consistent with his statement that on numerous occasions he was repeatedly struck on the head with a blunt instrument. The rectangular shape of the large haematoma on the right thigh and of the three haematomas on the left thigh corresponds exactly to blows struck with a blunt instrument, as described by the complainant. As to the accounts given by the defendants The defendants’ explanations of how the injuries found came about totally lack credibility. Moreover, on these points as on others, their explanations varied. JeanBernard Hervé, for instance, initially stated that he had acted as a reinforcement to arrest Selmouni (D57) but subsequently said that he was not in the street where the arrest took place but inside the hotel. The defendants maintain that the accusations against them are the result of orchestrated, concerted action. It should be noted at this point that throughout the seven years of inquiries and judicial investigation no evidence was found to substantiate that allegation. The complainants’ interests differed appreciably. The successive descriptions of the ill-treatment they alleged that they had suffered do not disclose any connivance, and it should be pointed out that Selmouni himself was hardly ever assisted by a lawyer in the proceedings concerning drug trafficking. It is not without relevance to note that Madi and Selmouni, who had never been in police custody before, could not have made use of previous experience of it to fabricate a completely false story. The mere fact of Selmouni’s arrest near his hotel, even if it is assumed to have entailed something of a struggle, cannot explain either the seriousness of the injuries or their gradual onset as confirmed by the photographs in the file, seeing that, immediately afterwards, the policemen concerned did not record any suspicious signs either on their own persons or on that of Selmouni, signs that would have warranted a thorough medical examination, which would have been in their own interest. As regards Madi, the policemen’s account, according to which he had deliberately banged his head against a wall and a cupboard, is not consistent with the findings of the medical examinations. The expert noted that in this type of occurrence it is normal to find, at the time of the events, unequivocal injuries and even bleeding wounds, which was not the case here. Taken as a whole, these factors persuade the Court that the alleged resistance to arrest was invented by the accused to justify the seriousness and location of the haematomas and the lesions found on the detainee. As to the reliability of the police reports The policemen from SDPJ 93, in particular Jean-Bernard Hervé, admitted in court that several reports drawn up during the detention of Selmouni and Madi in police custody contained inaccurate statements both as to times and as to the identity of those who had written them. No persuasive logical explanation of this was given to the Court. Hurault, for example, drew up a report (D114) on the search which he made at Gonesse from 5.30 p.m. to 6.55 p.m. on 26 November, and ‘recorded’ at 6.45 p.m. – that is to say at the same time – in another report (D158) that Madi had resisted arrest, and also told the Court that he had intervened to calm him. The complete unreliability of the documents drawn up by the investigators is extremely serious in that the entire functioning of the criminal justice system rests on the reliance that may be placed on the reports of senior police officers and their assistants [officiers et agents de police judiciaire]. In view of all the foregoing, the brutality of which the defendants are accused is patent and the trial court rightly held that during the proceedings they had done nothing but conceal the truth about their behaviour. … As to the sentence The offences of which the defendants are guilty are exceptionally serious ones, and that precludes their benefiting from the provisions of the amnesty of 3 August 1995. They must be regarded as instances of particularly degrading treatment. Having been committed by senior officials responsible for enforcing the laws of the Republic, they must be punished firmly as such conduct cannot be justified, irrespective of the personality of the offenders in their charge and the degree of their corruption and dangerousness. The seriousness of the offences, however, cannot be compared with what it would have been if the sexual assaults had been made out against the defendants. Nor do the offences appear to have been the result of a concerted plan. In view of the part played by each, the absence of any previous criminal record and the administrative files on the defendants, the Court considers that it must accordingly reduce the length of the prison sentences as indicated in the operative provisions of the judgment and leave it to the discretion of the defendants’ superiors to determine what disciplinary consequences are necessary in the case, the prison sentences being suspended, only in part as regards Hervé, whose responsibility appears greater, regard being had to his being the officer in charge. ...”",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

20,001-58226,Grand Chamber,"7.Mr Pélissier was born in 1944 and lives at Sanary-sur-Mer; Mr Sassi was born in 1935 and lives at . Both are French nationals.>On 16 October 1975 Mr Fernand Cortez and Mr Claude Cortez formed a private limited company (société à responsabilité limitée – Sàrl), Bleu Marine, whose object was the sale of pleasure craft. Fernand Cortez was appointed manager. In 1976 Bleu Marine started to trade with a public company, Chantiers Beneteau S.A., whose object was boat-building. On 8October 1981, Bleu Marine became Chantiers Beneteau’s exclusive distributor for the Var département coast.>On 31 March 1980 both applicants became shareholders in Bleu Marine, each holding 250 of a total of 1,000 shares (the remaining 500 belonged to the promoters, Fernand and Claude Cortez). 10.On 29 September 1982 Fernand Cortez, the applicants and MrDominique Stizi formed a private limited company, Station Service du Bateau Sàrl, which was run by Fernand Cortez and Dominique Stizi. Its objects were the development of port infrastructures, harbour building and the sale and outfitting of boats. The share capital was held by FernandCortez (48 shares), the applicants (24 shares), and Dominique Stizi (104shares). On 29 February 1984 the declared the company insolvent and ordered its judicial reorganisation. 11.By agreements made with Station Service du Bateau and another company, Cortez et Cie, Bleu Marine was granted a licence allowing it to launch its boats on the sea front. 12.In 1983 relations between Bleu Marine and Chantiers Beneteau started to deteriorate, the former owing the latter nearly three million French francs (FRF). Chantiers Beneteau then terminated the distribution agreement with Bleu Marine. 13.On 30 May 1983 Bleu Marine filed for insolvency. On 1 June 1983 the held that the company was insolvent and ordered its judicial reorganisation. 14.On 4 July 1984 the , finding that Bleu Marine had debts of almost FRF 10 million, ordered its liquidation under the supervision of the court. 15.On 20 June 1983 Chantiers Beneteau lodged a complaint with the senior investigating judge against a person or persons unknown for forgery of commercial documents and fraud by the falsification of a balance sheet and its use with a view to obtaining a rescheduling of debt which would never be honoured. On 16 December 1983 the investigating judge sent instructions to the Marseilles Regional Police Department. 16.On 27 June 1984 Fernand Cortez, the manager of Bleu Marine, was charged by the investigating judge assigned to the case. On 8October an additional charge of negligent and fraudulent bankruptcy was brought against him. On 22 January 1985 the investigating judge’s instructions of 16 December 1983 were carried out. The results revealed in particular the existence of a property holding company (société civile immobilière), SCI Le Ponant, which had been set up by Fernand Cortez, MrPélissier and Mr Sassi’s wife, in order to acquire land for letting to Bleu Marine. 17.On 15 October 1984 Mr and Mrs Grouzet lodged a complaint against Fernand Cortez and any other person having managerial responsibility for Bleu Marine, alleging misappropriation and, subsequently, fraud, in connection with the purchase and payment for a boat that was never delivered. On 4 October 1985 a Mr Louis Dreyer lodged a complaint against Fernand Cortez for misappropriation and applied to be joined to the proceedings as a civil party claiming damages. 18.On 14 September 1984, after appearing before the investigating judge on 20 and 21 August and 13 September 1984, the first applicant was charged with the offences set out in the complaint of 20 June 1983 and with negligent and fraudulent bankruptcy and misappropriation. 19.On 12 June 1985 the second applicant was charged with the same offences. 20.After Law no. 85-98 of 25 January 1985, which reformed insolvency law, came into force, the public prosecutor, considering there to be “strong evidence of criminal bankruptcy”, lodged an additional application to have Fernand Cortez, Dominique Stizi and the applicants charged with that offence under the new law. In so doing, he relied on the provisions relating to criminal bankruptcy and aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy. 21.In a letter of 14 November 1985 to the investigating judge, the lawyer acting for Chantiers Beneteau argued that a charge of aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy might lie against the applicants. On 17 July 1986 Chantiers Beneteau applied to be joined to the criminal bankruptcy proceedings as a civil party claiming damages. 22.On 1 December 1986 the investigating judge preferred an additional charge of “criminal bankruptcy” against Fernand Cortez under sections 196 and 197 of the Law of 25 January 1985 and Articles 402 and 403 of the Criminal Code. On 4, 16 and 19 December 1986 he preferred identical additional charges of “criminal bankruptcy” against the first applicant, the second applicant and Dominique Stizi respectively. 23.On 15 June 1987 the investigating judge appointed two accounting experts to audit the accounts. 24.On 30 June 1988 they submitted their report to the investigating judge. 25.On 10 January 1989 the investigating judge made an order transmitting the file to the public prosecutor for submissions (ordonnance de soit-communiqué). 26.On 27 June 1990 the investigating judge made a discharge order on the charges of forgery and using forged commercial documents, negligent and fraudulent bankruptcy and fraud; ultimately, the only charge on which the applicants were committed to stand trial at the Criminal Court was that of criminal bankruptcy under the Law of 25 January 1985. A discharge order was also made in the case of Fernand Cortez on the same charges and on the complaint lodged by Mr and Mrs Grouzet. He was committed to stand trial at the Criminal Court alone (on certain charges for which he was the sole defendant), with Dominique Stizi (on charges relating to the management of Station Service du Bateau), and with the applicants. In his order, the investigating judge cited Articles 402, 406 and 408 of the Criminal Code and sections 196 and 197 of the Law of 25 January 1985. 27.On 12 March 1991 the Toulon Criminal Court sentenced Fernand Cortez to one year’s imprisonment and a fine of FRF 20,000 for fraudulent bankruptcy, concealment of assets and misappropriation. It acquitted Dominique Stizi of the charges against him. Of the civil parties, Chantiers Beneteau’s application to be joined to the criminal bankruptcy proceedings was declared inadmissible and the court noted that Mr and Mrs Grouzet had withdrawn their application to be joined as civil parties; the only person to be awarded compensation was Louis Dreyer (in respect of the misappropriation by Fernand Cortez). 28.In the same judgment, the Toulon Criminal Court held with regard to the bankruptcy charges against the applicants: “It should firstly be noted that under the Law only de jure or de facto managers, not, as suggested by the prosecution, members, can commit the offence. Without it being necessary to consider whether the indictment is bad for failure to allege that the members [the applicants] were de facto managers, that being an essential element of the offence, it need only be observed that [the applicants] have not performed any acts of management, the de jure manager cannot be regarded as having been a ‘replaceable’, compliant manager and it does not appear that he gave the other two the right to sign on his behalf. ... Thus, as they cannot properly be described as de jure managers, the defendants Sassi and Pélissier must be acquitted of these offences.” 29.On 14 March 1991 Chantiers Beneteau appealed against that judgment. The public prosecutor and Fernand Cortez did likewise on 22March 1991. On 2 April 1992 Chantiers Beneteau lodged additional submissions with the registry of the Court of Appeal in which they proposed, in the alternative, recharacterising the acts the applicants were alleged to have committed as “aiding and abetting” criminal bankruptcy. 30.On 26 November 1992, after hearings on 16 April and 25 June 1992, the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal held that although the applicants could not be regarded as having been de facto managers of the company, they had nonetheless been informed of the serious difficulties it was in and had “wilfully performed positive, material acts that had facilitated, aided or abetted Cortez in the concealment of assets to the detriment of Bleu Marine”. It appears from the judgment that the applicants were regarded as appearing before the Court of Appeal as “defendants on criminal bankruptcy charges”. 31.The Court of Appeal consequently held that the applicants were guilty, not of the offences charged, but of the separate offence of aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy through the concealment of assets. As regards the first applicant in particular, the Court of Appeal found, inter alia, that he had furnished a false certificate in order to justify the payment of a sum of money in a suspect operation. It referred in its judgment to Chantiers Beneteau’s main submissions requesting the applicants’ conviction for criminal bankruptcy, but made no mention of the additional submissions lodged on 2 April 1992 concerning the accusation that they had aided and abetted criminal bankruptcy. There is a dispute as to whether that request was brought to the attention of the applicants; however, it is common ground that it was mentioned, as an ancillary point, by the civil party at the hearing. 32.The Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal sentenced each of the applicants to a suspended term of eighteen months’ imprisonment and to a fine of FRF 30,000. While upholding the conviction of Fernand Cortez and the partial discharge order made in his favour by the Toulon Criminal Court, it nonetheless increased the term of imprisonment to eighteen months, while suspending it, and the fine to FRF 30,000. Lastly, the Court of Appeal upheld Dominique Stizi’s acquittal, the award of damages to Louis Dreyer and the declaration that Chantiers Beneteau’s application to be joined as a civil party was inadmissible. 33.On 26 and 27 November 1992 the applicants appealed against that decision to the Court of Cassation on points of law. In their pleadings they denied the offence and contended on the basis of Article 6 of the Convention that the Court of Appeal’s decision to convict them of an offence different from that charged had not been the subject of adversarial argument and had infringed the rights of the defence. In addition, the first applicant submitted that when referring to alleged irregularities on his account the Court of Appeal had relied on allegations that had never been put to him and were incapable of showing that he had aided and abetted criminal bankruptcy. 34.In a judgment of 14 February 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants’ appeal on the grounds that: “... the reasons given in the impugned judgment enable the Court of Cassation to satisfy itself that the court below sufficiently made out, within the limits of its jurisdiction, all the constitutive elements of the actus reus and mens rea of both the principal offence of criminal bankruptcy committed by Fernand Cortez through the concealment of assets and the offence committed by Philippe Sassi and FrançoisPélissier of aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy through the concealment of assets. The grounds of appeal, which merely contest the findings which the court below, in its unfettered discretion, came to on the facts and circumstances of the case after hearing the parties’ submissions, cannot be upheld.” 35.The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide: Article 388 “The Criminal Court shall be seised of offences within its jurisdiction on the voluntary appearance of the parties, a summons accompanied by a statement of the charges, an immediate summary trial or, lastly, a committal by the investigating judge or judges.” Article 509 “The case is transferred to the Court of Appeal to the extent determined in the notice of appeal ...” 36.The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code in force at the material time were as follows: Article 59 “Accessories to a serious crime (crime) or other major offence (délit) shall be liable to the same penalties as the principals, except where statute provides otherwise.” Article 60 “A person who, by gifts, promises, threats, abuse of authority or power, scheming or contrivance, has incited the commission of a serious crime (crime) or other major offence (délit) or given instructions for its commission; has procured weapons, implements or any other means of assisting in the commission of an offence knowing that such weapons, implements or other means were intended for that purpose; or has knowingly aided or abetted the principal or principals in acts preparatory to the commission of the offence or facilitating its commission or in carrying out the offence, shall be guilty of an offence as accessories, without prejudice to the penalties specially imposed by this Code on persons conspiring to commit or inciting breaches of State security, even if the crime intended by those conspiring or inciting is not committed.” Article 402 “Persons found guilty of criminal bankruptcy shall be liable on conviction to between three months’ and five years’ imprisonment and a fine of between FRF10,000 and FRF 200,000 or to either of those penalties. In addition, an order may be made barring them from exercising the rights referred to in Article 42.” Article 403 “Accessories to criminal bankruptcy shall be liable to the same penalties as those laid down in the preceding Article, even if they are not merchants, craftsmen or farmers and do not directly or indirectly, de facto or de jure, manage a private-law legal entity having an economic activity.” 37.The relevant provisions of this law read as follows: Section 196 “The provisions of this Chapter are applicable to: (1)all traders and craftsmen; (2)anyone who has directly or indirectly, whether de jure or de facto, managed or liquidated a private-law entity having an economic activity; and (3)individuals who are permanent representatives of entities managing entities as defined in subsection 2 above.” Section 197 “Where judicial reorganisation proceedings are commenced, the persons referred to in section 196 shall be guilty of criminal bankruptcy if they are found to have done any of the following: (1)with the intention of avoiding or delaying the commencement of judicial reorganisation proceedings, made purchases with a view to resale at less than market value or used ruinous means to procure funding; (2)misappropriated or concealed all or part of the debtor’s assets; (3)fraudulently increased the debtor’s liabilities; or (4)held fictitious accounts or caused accounting documents of the undertaking or entity to disappear or failed to keep any accounts.”",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

84,001-67818,Grand Chamber,"10.The applicants were two television journalists. At the relevant time they were employed by one of the two national television stations in , Danmarks Radio. They produced two television programmes which were broadcast at 8 p.m. on 17 September 1990 and 22 April 1991 respectively. It was estimated that approximately 30% of all viewers above the age of 12 saw the programmes. The programmes, described as documentaries, were called “Convicted of Murder” (Dømt for mord) and “The Blind Eye of the Police” (Politiets blinde øje) respectively and dealt with a murder trial in which on 12 November 1982 the High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret) had convicted a person, hereafter called X, of murdering his wife on 12 December 1981 between approximately 11.30 a.m. and 1 p.m. X was sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment. On appeal, the Supreme Court (Højesteret) upheld the sentence in 1983. On 13 September 1990, following his release on probation, X requested the Special Court of Revision (Den Særlige Klageret) to reopen the case. The applicants had started to prepare the programmes in March 1989, establishing contact with witnesses through advertising in the local paper and via police reports. 11.Both programmes began with a statement of the premise on which they had been produced: “In this programme we shall provide evidence by way of a series of specific examples that there was no legal basis for X’s conviction and that, by imposing its sentence, the High Court of Western Denmark disregarded one of the fundamental tenets of the law in Denmark, namely that the accused should be given the benefit of the doubt. We shall show that a scandalously bad police investigation, in which the question of guilt was prejudged right from the start, and which ignored significant witnesses and concentrated on dubious ones, led to X being sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment for the murder of his wife. This programme will show that X could not have committed the crime of which he was convicted on 12 November 1982”. 12.At an early stage in the first programme, “Convicted of Murder”, the following comment was made: “In the case against X, the police investigation involved about 900 people. More than 4,000 pages of reports were written – and thirty witnesses appeared before the High Court of Western Denmark. We will try to establish what actually happened on the day of the murder, 12December 1981. We shall critically review the police investigations and evaluate the witnesses’ statements regarding the time of X’s wife’s disappearance.” When preparing this first programme, the applicants had invited the police of Frederikshavn district, who had been responsible for the investigation of the murder case, to take part. Having corresponded with the applicants on this subject for some time, the chief of police informed them by a letter of 19 April 1990 that the police could not participate in the programme as certain conditions for granting the interview, inter alia, that the questions be sent in writing in advance, had not been met. 13.Following the broadcast of the first programme on 17 September 1990, the applicants were charged with defamation on the ground that they had unlawfully connected the friend of X’s wife (“the schoolteacher”) with the death of two women referred to, one being X’s wife. The defamation case ended on 14 December 1993 before the High Court with a settlement according to which the applicants were to pay the schoolteacher 300,000Danish kroner (DKK), apologise unreservedly, and give an undertaking never to broadcast the programme again. 14.The applicants alleged that the chief superintendent, in a telephone conversation with Mr Pedersen at some unknown time before the broadcast of the second programme, had declined to participate in the programme. 15.In the introduction to the second programme, the following comment was made: “It was the police of Frederikshavn district who were responsible at that time for the investigations which led to X’s conviction. Did the police assume right from the start that X was the killer, and did they therefore fail to investigate all the leads in the case, as required by the law? We have investigated whether there is substance in X’s serious allegations against the police of Frederikshavn district.” 16.A little later in the programme, the second applicant interviewed a taxi driver, who explained that she had been questioned by two police officers a few days after the disappearance of X’s wife, and that she had mentioned on that occasion two observations she had made on 12 December 1981: she had seen a Peugeot taxi (which was later shown to have no relevance to the murder), and before that she had seen X and his son at five or ten minutes past noon. She had driven behind them for about one kilometre. The reason she could remember the date and time so clearly was because she had to attend her grandmother’s funeral on that day at 1 p.m. 17.The following comment was then made: “Commentator: So in December 1981, shortly after X’s wife disappeared and X was in prison, the Frederikshavn police were in possession of the taxi driver’s statement, in which she reported that shortly after noon that Saturday she had driven behind X and his son for about a kilometre ... So X and his son were in Mølleparken [residential area] twice, and the police knew it in 1981.” 18.The interview went on: “Second applicant: What did the police officers say about the information you provided? Taxi driver:Well, one of them said that it couldn’t be true that X’s son was in the car, but in fact I am a hundred percent certain it was him, as I also know the son because I have driven him to the day-care centre. Second applicant:Why did he say that to you? Taxi driver:Well, he just said that it couldn’t be true that the son was there. Second applicant:That it couldn’t be true that you saw what you saw. Taxi driver: No, that is, he didn’t say that I hadn’t seen X, it just couldn’t be true that the son was with him. Second applicant:These were the two police officers who questioned the taxi driver in 1981 and who wrote the police report. We showed the taxi driver her statement of 1981, which she had never seen before. Taxi driver:It’s missing, the bit about – there was only ... about the Peugeot, there was nothing about the rest, unless you have another one. Second applicant:There is only this one. Taxi driver: But it obviously cannot have been important. Second applicant: What do you think about that? Taxi driver:Well it says, I don’t know, well I think when you make a statement, it should be written down in any case, otherwise I can’t see any point in it, and especially not in a murder case. Commentator:So the taxi driver claims that in 1981 she had already told two police officers that she had seen X and his son. Not a word of this is mentioned in this report. Second applicant:Why are you so sure that you told the police this at the time, which was 1981? Taxi driver:Well I am a hundred percent sure of it and also, my husband sat beside me in the living room as a witness so... , so that is why I am a hundred percent certain that I told them. Second applicant:And he was there throughout the entire interview? Taxi driver:Yes, he was. Second applicant:Not just part of the interview? Taxi driver:No, he was there all the time. Commentator:It was not until 1990, nine years later, that the taxi driver heard of the matter again, shortly after the ‘Convicted of Murder’ programme had been shown; even though the taxi driver’s report had been filed as a so-called 0 report, she was phoned by a chief inspector of the Flying Squad [Rejseholdet] who had been asked by the public prosecutor to do a few more interviews. Taxi driver:The chief inspector called me and asked whether I knew if any of my colleagues knew anything they had not reported, or whether I had happened to think of something, and I then told him on the phone what I said the first time about the Peugeot and that I had driven behind X and his son up to Ryets Street, and then he said that if he found anything out, or if... or if there was anything else, then... then he would get in touch with me again, which he didn’t, not until a while afterwards, when he called me and asked whether I would come for another interview. Second applicant:When you told the chief inspector in your telephone call that you followed X, and that his son was in the car, what did he say about that? Taxi driver:Well, he didn’t say anything. Second applicant:He did not say that you had never reported this? Taxi driver:No, he didn’t.” 19.The second applicant then conducted a short interview with X’s new counsel: “Second applicant:Have you any comment on the explanation the taxi driver has given now? X’s new counsel:I have no comment to make at this time. Second applicant:Why not? X’s new counsel:I have agreed with the public prosecutor, and the President of the Special Court of Revision, that statements to the press in this matter will in future only be issued by the Special Court of Revision. Commentator:Even though X’s new counsel does not wish to speak about the case, we know from other sources that it was he who, in February this year, asked for the taxi driver to be interviewed again. So in March she was interviewed at Frederikshavn police station in the presence of the chief superintendent, which is clearly at odds with what the public prosecutor previously stated in public, namely that the Frederikshavn police would not get the opportunity to be involved in the new inquiries.” 20.The interview with the taxi driver continued: “Second applicant:And what happened at the interview? Taxi driver:What happened was that I was shown into the office of the chief inspector of the Flying Squad and the chief superintendent was there too. Second applicant:Was any explanation given about why he was present? Taxi driver:No. Second applicant:So what did you say in this interview? Taxi driver:I gave the same explanations as I had done the first time when I was interviewed at home. Second applicant:Ten years before, that is. Taxi driver:Yes. Second applicant:And that was? Taxi driver:Well, that I had driven behind X and his son up to . Second applicant:What did they say about that? Taxi driver:They didn’t say anything. Second applicant:The report which was made in 1981, did you see it? Taxi driver:No. Second applicant:Was it there in the room? Taxi driver:There was a report there when I was being interviewed, but I wasn’t allowed to see it. Second applicant:Did you expressly ask whether you could see the old report? Taxi driver:I asked whether I could see it but the chief inspector said I couldn’t ...” 21.After the interview with the taxi driver the commentator said: “Now we are left with all the questions: why did the vital part of the taxi driver’s explanation disappear and who, in the police or public prosecutor’s office, should bear the responsibility for this? Was it the two police officers who failed to write a report about it? Hardly, sources in the police tell us they would not dare. Was it [the named chief superintendent] who decided that the report should not be included in the case file? Or did he and the chief inspector of the Flying Squad conceal the witness’s statement from the defence, the judges and the jury? ...” Pictures of the two police officers, the named chief superintendent and the chief inspector of the Flying Squad, were shown on the screen simultaneously and parallel with the above questions. The questions went on: “Why did the chief inspector phone the taxi driver shortly after the television programme ‘Convicted of Murder’? After all, the police had taken the view that the taxi driver had no importance as a witness and had filed her statement among the 0 reports. Why did the chief inspector not call her in for an interview when she repeated her original explanation on the telephone? Why was the taxi driver interviewed at the Frederikshavn police station in the presence of the chief superintendent, which was completely at odds with the public prosecutor’s public statement? On 20 September last year [a named] Chief Constable stated to [a regional daily]: ‘All the information connected to the case has been submitted to the defendants, the prosecution and the judges.’ Did the Chief Constable know about the taxi driver’s statement, when he made this statement? Did the State Prosecutor know already in 1981 that there was a statement from a witness confirming that X had been in Mølleparken twice, and that X’s son had been with him both times? Neither of them have agreed to make any statement at all about the case.” 22.In the meantime, on 11 March 1991, before the broadcast of the second programme, the taxi driver had again been interviewed by the police, at the request of X’s new counsel. She stated that on 12 December 1981 she had attended her grandmother’s funeral at 1 p.m. and that on her way there, around five or ten minutes past noon, she had driven behind X and his son. She had arrived at the funeral just before 1 p.m. She also explained that she had told the police about this when first interviewed in 1981. Later on 11March 1991 the police carried out a check which revealed that the funeral of the taxi driver’s grandmother had indeed taken place on 12December 1981, but at 2 p.m. Subsequently, the police held three interviews with the taxi driver, during which she changed her explanation, in particular as follows. On 24 April 1991 she maintained having seen X shortly after noon but agreed that the funeral had taken place at 2 p.m. On her way there she realised she had forgotten a wreath. She had had to return home and had consequently arrived at the funeral just before 2 p.m. On 25 April 1991 she stated that she was not sure about the date or the time she had seen X and his son. Moreover, she was uncertain whether, shortly after the murder, she had told the police about having seen X. She also explained that, during the shooting of her interview with MrBaadsgaard on 4 April 1991, he had suggested that she say something like “where is the other report?” when he showed her the 1981 report. On 27 April 1991 she initially stated that she had not seen X and his son on 12 December 1981. She had never before connected this episode to the funeral. She also admitted having made up the story about the forgotten wreath, but had wanted “things to fit”. Later during the interview she maintained that she had seen X and his son on 12 December 1981, but at around 1 p.m. 23.On 23 May 1991 the chief superintendent reported the applicants and the television station to the police for defamation. It appears, however, that the prosecution’s decision as to whether or not to charge the applicants was adjourned pending the decision whether to reopen X’s case. 24.This was decided in the affirmative by the Special Court of Revision on 29 November 1991 after two hearings and the examination of ten witnesses, including the taxi driver. Two judges (out of five) in the Special Court of Revision found that new testimonial evidence had been produced on which X might have been acquitted, had it been available at the trial. Two other judges found that no new testimonial evidence had been produced on which X might have been acquitted, had it been available at the trial. The fifth judge agreed with the latter, but found that in other respects special circumstances existed which made it overwhelmingly likely that the available evidence had not been judged correctly. Accordingly, the court granted a retrial. 25.In the meantime, following the television programmes, an inquiry had commenced into the police investigation of X’s case. The inquiry resulted in a report of 29 July 1991 by the Regional State Prosecutor, according to which the police in Frederikshavn had not complied with section 751(2) of the Administration of Justice Act (Retsplejeloven). This provision, introduced on 1 October 1978, provides that a witness must be given the opportunity to read through his or her statement. The non-compliance had not been limited to the investigation in X’s case. Instead, allegedly in order to minimise errors or misunderstandings, the police in Frederikshavn usually interviewed witnesses in the presence of two police officers and made sure that crucial witnesses repeated their statements before a court as soon as possible. In this connection, the Regional State Prosecutor noted that the High Court, before which X had been convicted in 1982, had not made any comments on the failure to comply with section751(2) of the Administration of Justice Act with regard to the witnesses who were heard before it in 1982. Finally, the Regional State Prosecutor noted that the Frederikshavn district police were apparently not the only district police failing to comply with the said provision. The Regional State Prosecutor considered it unjustified to maintain that the taxi driver, when interviewed in December 1981, had stated that she had seen X on the day of the murder. During the inquiry this had been contradicted by the two police officers who had interviewed her in 1981. Moreover, the inquiry did not indicate that anyone within the Frederikshavn police had suppressed any evidence in X’s case, or in any other criminal case for that matter. Consequently, on 20 December 1991, the Prosecutor General (Rigsadvokaten) stated in a letter to the Ministry of Justice that it was unfortunate and open to criticism that the police in Frederikshavn had not implemented the above provision as part of their usual routine, and informed the Ministry that he had agreed with the State Police Academy that he would produce a wider set of guidelines concerning the questioning of witnesses, which could be integrated into the Police Academy’s educational material. 26.X’s retrial ended with his acquittal in a judgment of 13 April 1992 by the High Court of Western Denmark, sitting with a jury. 27.A lawyer who represented the applicants in another case had become aware of a letter of 18 May 1992 from the Prosecutor General to the Legal Affairs Committee (Retsudvalget) of the Danish parliament mentioning that, subsequent to the broadcast of the programme “The Blind Eye of the Police”, the applicants had been reported to the police by three police officers from Frederikshavn. By a letter of 10 July 1992, the lawyer requested that the Prosecutor General state whether the applicants had been charged, and if so with what offence. By a letter of 17 July 1992, he was told that no charge had been brought against the applicants. 28.On 19 January 1993 the Chief Constable in Gladsaxe informed the applicants that they were charged with defaming the chief superintendent. On 28 January 1993 the applicants were questioned by the police in Gladsaxe. 29.A request of 11 February 1993 by the prosecution to seize the applicants’ research material was examined at a hearing in the Gladsaxe City Court (Retten i Gladsaxe) on 30 March 1993, during which the applicants’ counsel, claiming that the case concerned a political offence, requested that a jury in the High Court – instead of the City Court – try the case. Both requests were refused by the Gladsaxe City Court on 28 May 1993. In June 1993 the prosecution appealed against the decision on seizure and the applicants appealed against the decision on venue. At the request of one of the applicants’ counsel, an oral hearing was scheduled to take place in the High Court of Eastern Denmark (Østre Landsret) on 15 November 1993. However, on 7 October 1993 counsel challenged one of the judges in the High Court, alleging disqualification, and requested an oral hearing on the issue. The High Court decided on 15 October 1993 to refuse an oral hearing and on 11 November 1993 it decided that the judge in question was not disqualified. It appears that counsel requested leave to appeal against this decision to the Supreme Court (Højesteret), but to no avail. As to the appeal against non-seizure and the question of venue, hearings were held in the High Court on 6 January and 7 March 1994, and by a decision of 21March 1994 the High Court upheld the City Court’s decisions. The applicants’ request for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was refused on 28 June 1994. 30.On 5 July 1994 the prosecution submitted an indictment to the City Court. A preliminary hearing was held on 10 November 1994 during which it was agreed that the case would be tried over six days in mid-June 1995. However, as counsel for one of the parties was ill, the final hearings were rescheduled to take place on 21, 24, 28 and 30 August and 8 September 1995. 31.On 15 September 1995 the Gladsaxe City Court delivered a sixty-eight-page judgment, finding that the questions put in the television programme concerning the named chief superintendent amounted to defamatory allegations, which should be declared null and void. However, the court did not impose any sentence on the applicants as it found that they had had reason to believe that the allegations were true. The court also ruled in favour of the applicants regarding a compensation claim by the widow of the named chief superintendent, who had died before the trial. The judgment was appealed against by the applicants immediately, and by the prosecution on 27 September 1995. 32.On 15 April 1996 the prosecutor sent a notice of appeal to the High Court, and on 30 April 1996 he invited counsel for the applicants and the attorney for the widow of the chief superintendent to a meeting concerning the proceedings. Counsel for one of the parties stated that he was unable to attend before 17 June 1996, and accordingly the meeting was held on 25June 1996. The High Court received the minutes of the meeting, from which it appeared that counsel for one of the parties was unable to attend the trial before November 1996, and that he preferred the hearings to take place in early 1997. On 16 August 1996 the High Court scheduled the hearings for 24, 26 and 28 February and 3 and 4 March 1997. 33.On 6 March 1997 the High Court gave judgment convicting the applicants of tarnishing the honour of the chief superintendent by making and spreading allegations of an act likely to disparage him in the eyes of his fellow citizens, under Article 267 § 1 of the Penal Code. The allegations were declared null and void. The applicants were each sentenced to twenty day-fines of DKK 400 (or twenty days’ imprisonment in default) and ordered to pay compensation of DKK 75,000 to the estate of the deceased chief superintendent. 34.On 6, 16 and 25 March 1997 the applicants sought leave from the Leave-to-Appeal Board (Procesbevillingsnævnet) to appeal to the Supreme Court. Before deciding, the Board requested an opinion from the prosecuting authorities, namely the Chief of Police, the State Prosecutor and the Prosecutor General. On 27 June 1997 they submitted a joint opinion opposing leave to appeal. However, in the meantime, it appears that a lawyer representing the television station Danmarks Radio had contacted the State Prosecutor, proposing that the public prosecution assist in bringing the case before the Supreme Court as, according to the television station, the High Court’s judgment was incompatible with the Media Responsibility Act (Medieansvarsloven). Consequently, the public prosecutors initiated a new round of consultation on this question, and their joint opinion was forwarded to the Board on 3 September 1997. On 29 September 1997, having heard the applicants’ counsel on the prosecution’s submissions, the Board granted the applicants leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. 35.The Prosecutor General submitted a notice of appeal and sent the case file to the Supreme Court on 3 October and 6 November 1997 respectively. 36.As counsel for the applicants wanted to engage yet another counsel, on 20 November 1997 they asked the Supreme Court whether costs in this respect would be considered legal costs. Moreover, they stated that their pleadings could not be submitted until early January 1998. On 17 March 1998 the Supreme Court decided on the question of costs, and on 19 March 1998 scheduled the hearing for 12 and 13 October 1998. 37.By a judgment of 28 October 1998, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court’s judgment, but increased the compensation payable to the estate to DKK 100,000. The majority of judges (three out of five) held: “In the programme ‘The Blind Eye of the Police’, [the applicants] not only repeated a statement by the taxi driver that she had already explained to the police during their inquiries in 1981 that shortly after noon on 12 December 1981 she had driven behind X for about one kilometre, but also, in accordance with the common premise for the programmes ‘Convicted of Murder’ and ‘The Blind Eye of the Police’, took a stand on the truth of the taxi driver’s statement and presented matters in such a way that viewers, even before the final sequence of questions, were given the impression that it was a fact that the taxi driver had given the explanation as she alleged she had done in 1981 and that the police were therefore in possession of this statement in 1981. This impression was strengthened by the first of the concluding questions: ‘... why did the vital part of the taxi driver’s explanation disappear and who, in the police or public prosecutor’s office, should bear the responsibility for this?’. In connection with the scenes about the two police officers [the applicants] include two questions in the commentator’s narrative, to which the indictment relates; irrespective of the fact that they were phrased as questions, viewers undoubtedly received a clear impression that a report had been made about the taxi driver’s statement that she had seen X at the relevant time on 12 December 1981; that this report had subsequently been suppressed; and that such suppression had been decided upon either by the named chief superintendent alone or by him and the chief inspector of the Flying Squad jointly. The subsequent questions in the commentator’s narrative do not weaken this impression, and neither does the question whether the Chief Constable or the public prosecutor were aware of the taxi driver’s statement. On this basis we find that in the programme ‘The Blind Eye of the Police’ [the applicants] made allegations against the named superintendent which were intended to discredit him in the eyes of his peers, within the meaning of Article 267 § 1 of the Penal Code [Straffeloven]. We find further that it must have been clear to [the applicants] that they were, by way of their presentation, making such allegations. [The applicants] have not endeavoured to provide any justification but have claimed that there is no cause of action by virtue of Article 269 § 1 of the Penal Code – [which protects] a party who in good faith justifiably makes an allegation which is clearly in the general public interest or in the interest of other parties ... As laid down in Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland (judgment of 25 June 1992), there is a very extensive right to public criticism of the police. As in that decision there is, however, a difference between passing on and making allegations, just as there is a difference between criticism being directed at the police as such and at individual named officers in the police force. Even though being in the public eye is a natural part of a police officer’s duties, consideration should also be given to his good name and reputation. As stated, [the applicants] did not limit themselves in the programme to referring to the taxi driver’s statement or to making value judgments on this basis about the quality of the police investigations and the chief superintendent’s leadership thereof. Nor did [the applicants] limit themselves to making allegations against the police as such for having suppressed the taxi driver’s explanation; they alleged that the named chief superintendent had committed a criminal offence by suppressing a vital fact. When [the applicants] were producing the programme, they knew that an application had been made to the Special Court of Revision for the case against X to be reopened and that, as part of the Court of Revision’s proceedings in dealing with the said application, the taxi driver had been interviewed by the police on 11 March 1991 at the request of X’s defence as part of the proceedings to reopen the case. In consequence of the ongoing proceedings for reopening the case, [the applicants] could not count on the chief superintendent and the two police officers who had interviewed the taxi driver in 1981 being prepared to participate in the programme and hence possibly anticipate proceedings in the Court of Revision. Making the allegations cannot accordingly be justified by lack of police participation in the programme. [The applicants’] intention, in the programme, of undertaking a critical assessment of the police investigation was legitimate in relation to the role of the media as public watchdog, but this does not apply to every allegation. [The applicants] had no basis for making such a serious allegation against a named police officer, and [the applicants’] opportunities for achieving the aims of the programme in no way required the questions upon which the charges are based to be included. On this basis, and even though the exemptions provided in Article 10 § 2 of the Convention must be narrowly interpreted and Article 10 protects not only the content of utterances but also the manner in which they are made, we agree that the allegation made was not caught by the exemption in Article 269 § 1 of the Penal Code. Indeed, as a result of the seriousness of the allegation, we agree that there is no basis for the punishment to be remitted in accordance with Article 269 § 2 of the Penal Code. We agree further that there are no grounds for a remittal of penalty under Article 272. We also concur with the findings on defamation. We agree with the High Court that the fact that the allegation was made in a programme on the national television station Danmarks Radio and hence could be expected to get widespread publicity – as indeed it did – must be regarded as an aggravating factor for the purposes of Article 267 § 3. Considering that it is more than seven years since the programme was shown, we do not find, however, that there are sufficient grounds for increasing the sentence. For the reasons given by the High Court, we find that [the applicants] must pay damages to the heirs of the chief superintendent. In this connection, it should be noted that it cannot be regarded as crucial that the nature of the claim for damages was not stated in the writ of 23 May 1991, since the chief superintendent’s claim for financial compensation could not relate to anything other than damages. Due to the seriousness of the allegation and the manner of its presentation, we find that the compensation should be increased to DKK 100,000.” 38.The minority of two judges who argued for the applicants’ acquittal held, inter alia: “We agree that the statements covered by the indictment, irrespective of their having been phrased as questions, have to be regarded as indictable under Article 267 § 1 of the Penal Code and that [the applicants] had the requisite intention. As stated by the majority, the question of culpability must be decided in accordance with Article 269 § 1, taken together with Article 267 § 1, interpreted in the light of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights’s restrictive interpretation of the exemptions under Article 10 § 2. In reaching a decision, consideration must be given to the basis on which [the applicants] made their allegations, their formulation and the circumstances under which they were made, as well as [the applicants’] intentions in the programme. ... We find that [the applicants] had cause to suppose that the taxi driver’s statement that she had seen X on 12 December 1981 shortly past noon was true. We further find ... that [the applicants] had reason to assume that the taxi driver, when interviewed in 1981, had told the two police officers that she had seen X ...We accordingly attach weight to the fact that it is natural for such an observation to be reported to the police; that it is also apparent from her explanation in the police report of 11 March 1991 that she had already told the police about her observations in 1981; and that her explanation about the reaction of the police to her information that X’s son had been in the car strengthened the likelihood of her having reported the observation at the interview in 1981. ... It is apparent from the television programme that [the applicants] were aware that the Frederikshavn police had not at that time complied with the requirement to offer a person interviewed an opportunity to see the records of his or her statements. [The applicants] may accordingly have had some grounds for supposing that the December report did not contain the taxi driver’s full statement or that there was another report thereon ... We consider that [the applicants], in putting the questions covered by the indictment, did not exceed the limits of the freedom of expression which, in a case such as the present one, which relates to serious matters of considerable public interest, should be available to the media. We also attach some weight to the fact that the programme was instrumental in the Court of Revision’s decision to hear witnesses and we attach some weight to X’s subsequent acquittal. Overall, we accordingly find that [the allegation] is not punishable by virtue of Article 269 § 1 of the Penal Code ... [We agree that] the allegation should be declared null and void since its veracity has not been proved ...” 39.The relevant provisions of the Danish Penal Code applicable at the time read as follows: Article 154 “If a person in the exercise of a public office or function has been guilty of false accusation, an offence relating to evidence ... or breach of trust, the penalty prescribed for the particular offence may be increased by not more than one-half.” Article 164 “1.Any person who gives false evidence before a public authority with the intention that an innocent person shall thereby be charged with, convicted of, or subject to the legal consequence of, a punishable act shall be liable to mitigated detention [hæfte] or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six years.>Similar punishment shall apply to any person who destroys, distorts or removes evidence or furnishes false evidence with the intention that any person shall thereby be charged with, or convicted of, a criminal act ...” Article 267 “1.Any person who tarnishes the honour of another by offensive words or conduct or by making or spreading allegations of an act likely to disparage him in the eyes of his fellow citizens shall be liable to a fine or to mitigated detention. ...>When imposing sentence it shall be considered an aggravating circumstance if the insult was made in printed documents or in any other way likely to give it wider circulation, or in such places or at such times as greatly to aggravate the offensive character of the act.” Article 268 “If an allegation has been maliciously made or disseminated, or if the author has no reasonable ground to regard it as true, he shall be guilty of defamation and liable to mitigated detention or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. If the allegation has not been made or disseminated publicly, the punishment may, in mitigating circumstances, be reduced to a fine.” Article 269 “1.An allegation shall not be punishable if its truth has been established or if the author of the allegation has in good faith been under an obligation to speak or has acted in lawful protection of an obvious public interest or of the personal interest of himself or of others.>The punishment may be remitted where evidence is produced which justifies the grounds for regarding the allegations as true.” Article 272 “The penalty prescribed in Article 267 of the Penal Code may be remitted if the act has been provoked by improper behaviour on the part of the injured person or if he is guilty of retaliation.” 40.Section 751 of the Administration of Justice Act read as follows: “(1)The relevant parts of the given testimonies must be included in the reports and particularly important parts of the testimonies should as far as possible be reported using the person’s own words. (2)The person interviewed shall be given the opportunity to acquaint himself with the report. Any corrections or supplementary information shall be included in the report. The person interviewed shall be informed that he is not obliged to sign the report. (3)Audio recordings of the interview may only take place after informing the person interviewed.”",2004,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

190,001-58211,Grand Chamber,"8.The applicants, all of whom are British citizens, live in the United Kingdom, except Mr McDaid who lives in Germany.>At the time of the events in question, the following applicants were serving in the Royal Air Force: Mr Cable, Mr Elliott, Mr Poinen, Mr Birnie, MrPascoe, Mr Jarrett, Mr Frame, Mr R.M. Smith, Mr Hunt, Mr Billing, MrBarron, Mr Rodgers, Mr Young, Mr G.E. Smith, Mr Evans, Mr Potter, Mr Boullemier, Mr Graham, Mr Ledger, Mr Wardle, Mr Lewis, Mr Wilson, Mr Curran and Mr Bruce. The other eleven applicants, namely Mr Partoon, MrBattle, Ms Hiley, Mr McDaid, Mr Campbell, Mr Finch, Mr Gooch, MrSmart, Mr Roberts, Mr Nash and Ms Powell, were serving in the Army. 10.Each applicant was charged with one or more civilian criminal offences or armed forces’ disciplinary offences and tried, convicted and sentenced by a court martial under either the Air Force Act 1955 or the Army Act 1955 (see paragraphs 11 to 12 below). All the applicants pleaded not guilty, except MrRodgers and Mr Lewis who pleaded guilty. 11.The relevant provisions of the Army Act 1955 and the Air Force Act 1955 are set out respectively in the Court’s Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, pp. 272-75, §§ 32-51, and its Coyne v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 September 1997, Reports 1997-V, pp. 1848-52, §§ 20-44. 12.Central to the system under the 1955 Acts was the role of the “convening officer”. This officer (who had to be of a specified rank and in command of a body of the regular forces or of the command within which the person to be tried was serving) assumed responsibility for every case to be tried by court martial. He or she had the final decision on the nature and detail of the charges to be brought and the type of court martial required, and was responsible for convening the court martial. The convening officer would draw up a convening order, which would specify, inter alia, the date, place and time of the trial, the name of the president and the details of the other members, all of whom he could appoint. Failing the appointment of a judge advocate by the Judge Advocate General’s Office, the convening officer could appoint one. He also appointed, or directed a commanding officer to appoint, the prosecuting officer. Prior to the hearing, the convening officer was responsible for sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and to the judge advocate, and could indicate the passages which might be inadmissible. He procured the attendance at trial of all witnesses to be called for the prosecution. When charges were withdrawn, the convening officer’s consent was normally obtained, although it was not necessary in all cases, and a plea to a lesser charge could not be accepted from the accused without it. He had also to ensure that the accused had a proper opportunity to prepare his defence, legal representation if required and the opportunity to contact the defence witnesses, and was responsible for ordering the attendance at the hearing of all witnesses “reasonably requested” by the defence. The convening officer could dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial, when required in the interests of the administration of justice. In addition, he could comment on the proceedings of a court martial. Those remarks would not form part of the record of the proceedings and would normally be communicated in a separate minute to the members of the court, although in an exceptional case, where a more public instruction was required in the interests of discipline, they could be made known in the orders of the command. The convening officer usually acted as confirming officer also. A court martial’s findings were not effective until confirmed by the confirming officer, who was empowered to withhold confirmation or substitute, postpone or remit in whole or in part any sentence. 13.Since the applicants’ trials, the law has been amended by the Armed Forces Act 1996 (see the above-mentioned Findlay judgment, p. 276, §§5257). 14.In their applications to the Commission (see paragraph 1 above), the applicants submitted that they had been denied fair hearings by independent and impartial tribunals established by law, contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. 15.The Commission declared the applications admissible on 9 April 1997, except those of Mr Bruce, Mr Nash and Ms Powell, which it declared admissible on 2 July 1997. In its thirty-five reports of 4 March 1998 (former Article 31 of the Convention), it expressed the unanimous opinions that in each case there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1, in that the applicant had not received a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, and that it was not necessary to examine other complaints raised by the applicants concerning specific aspects of the fairness of the court-martial proceedings. The full text of the Commission’s opinions is reproduced as an annex to this judgment1.",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

26,001-58847,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicant, who was born in 1958 in Tunisia, entered France in 1980 at the age of 22. On 14 September 1992 he married a French national, an invalid whose disability had been assessed at 80%, with whom he had been living since 1983. 10.On 1 December 1988 the Alpes-Maritimes Assize Court sentenced the applicant to six years’ imprisonment for armed robbery and armed assault with intent for offences committed in 1985. He was released on 14April 1990. 11.On 8 August 1991 the Minister of the Interior made a deportation order against him. The order was served on the applicant, who had been unaware of its existence, on 6 October 1992, when he attended the Nice Centre for Administrative Formalities in order to regularise his status. 12.He refused to travel to Tunisia and was prosecuted for failing to comply with a deportation order. On 19 November 1992 the Nice Criminal Court sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment and made an order excluding him from French territory for ten years. That decision was upheld on appeal by the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal on 7 June 1993. An appeal on points of law was dismissed by the Court of Cassation on 1 June 1994 on the ground that the applicant had failed to challenge the legality of the deportation order in the courts below. 13.On 22 July 1994 the applicant applied to the Criminal Cases Review Board of the Court of Cassation for a review of the criminal proceedings that had resulted in his being imprisoned for one year and banned from French territory for ten years. In a judgment of 28 April 1997, which was served on 22 September 1997, the Court of Cassation dismissed that application. 14.In December 1992 the applicant sought judicial review of the deportation order. In a judgment of 14 February 1994 the Nice Administrative Court quashed the deportation order of 8 August 1991, inter alia, on the ground that no notice had been served on the applicant requiring him to appear before the Deportation Board. That judgment became final on 14March 1994 after being served on the Minister of the Interior. 15.On the strength of the administrative court’s judgment of 14 February 1994 quashing the deportation order, the applicant applied to the Principal Public Prosecutor’s Office at the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal on 12 August 1994 for rescission of the ten-year exclusion order made by the Nice Criminal Court on 19 November 1992. He contended that he was married to a French national and held a provisional residence permit. 16.In a letter of 6 July 1995 the applicant reminded the Principal Public Prosecutor’s Office of the terms of his application for rescission. Noting that the application had been outstanding for some time, he asked the office to arrange for it to be heard and a ruling given. On 12 July 1995 the Principal Public Prosecutor’s Office requested the Public Prosecutor’s Office at the Nice tribunal de grande instance for its opinion on the merits of the application and any information that would assist the court in deciding whether the exclusion order should be rescinded. On 19 September 1995 Nice Central Police Station sent the Principal Public Prosecutor’s Office the results of an inquiry concerning the applicant. 17.On 3 November 1997 the Principal Public Prosecutor’s Office at the Court of Appeal informed the applicant that the case would be heard on 26January 1998. On that date the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal granted the applicant’s application and rescinded the exclusion order on the ground that the Nice Administrative Court had quashed the deportation order. 18.The applicant also sought to regularise his status with the immigration authorities. He initially obtained acknowledgment forms for applications for provisional residence permits (not work permits) for renewable three-month periods. On 4 September 1995, however, he was given a new three-month residence permit incorporating the right to seek employment. 19.On 14 September 1995 the applicant applied to the prefect for the Alpes-Maritimes département for a residence permit allowing him to live and work in France for a prolonged period, as he was married to a French citizen. On 9 April 1996 the applicant received notice of a decision dated 2April 1996 refusing him a residence permit. He appealed to the Nice Administrative Court, but his appeal was dismissed on 27 September 1996. 20.The applicant appealed on 24 December 1996 to the Lyons Administrative Court of Appeal. On 29 August 1997 the President of that court ordered the transfer of the file to the Marseilles Administrative Court of Appeal – the court with jurisdiction – where the case is currently pending. 21.On 21 July 1998 the applicant obtained a temporary residence permit valid for one year (from 13 July 1998 to 12 July 1999). Recently he obtained a ten-year residence permit with the right to seek employment. 22.Article 27 of the Ordinance of 2 November 1945 as amended, concerning the conditions of entry and residence of aliens in France reads as follows: “Any alien who has evaded or attempted to evade the execution of an order refusing him leave to enter France, a deportation order or a removal order or who, having been deported or being subject to an exclusion order, re-enters the national territory without authorisation shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of from six months to threeyears. The same penalty may be imposed on any alien who fails to present to the relevant administrative authority travel documents enabling any of the measures mentioned in the first sub-paragraph to be executed or who does not have such documents and fails to supply the information necessary to allow such execution. The court may in addition issue an order banning a person so convicted from re-entering the territory for a period not exceeding ten years. A ban on re-entering the territory automatically entails the convicted person’s removal from French territory, on completion of his prison sentence where appropriate.” 23.Article 702-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows: “Any person subject to a ban, forfeiture or incapacity or any measure whatsoever by operation of law following a criminal conviction or imposed as an additional penalty on sentencing may request the court which convicted him, or, if more than one, the last court to convict him, to end all or part of it, including provisions relating to the length of such ban, forfeiture or incapacity. ...” 24.Article 703 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows: “Applications by convicted persons for the ending of a ban ... shall contain particulars of the date of conviction and the places where the applicant has been living since his conviction or release. Applications shall be sent to the Public Prosecutor’s Office or, as the case may be, the Principal Public Prosecutor’s Office, which shall obtain all relevant information and, if appropriate, the opinion of the judge responsible for the execution of sentences, and shall refer the application to the relevant court. The court shall decide applications in private after considering the submissions of the prosecution. It shall hear the applicant or his or her lawyer, but may decide the application in their absence provided due notice has been served on them to attend ... A reference to the order ending all or part of a ban, forfeiture or incapacity ... shall be entered on the judgment of the court of trial or retrial and the convicted person’s criminal record.”",2000,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

45,001-58296,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicant, who was born in 1911, lives in Rome. 10.On 31 January 1990 she instituted proceedings in the Rome District Court against a local health clinic in Rome for payment of an adjustment for inflation and of statutory interest in respect of arrears of her widow’s pension which had been paid six years late. 11.At the first hearing, on 9 March 1990, the court noted that the defendant had failed to appear and the judge preparing the case for trial directed that the final submissions be made on 24 March 1990. That hearing was adjourned of the court’s own motion to 24 January 1991 because the judge had been transferred. The trial before the relevant division was held on 14 October 1991. In a judgment of 24 October 1991, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 9 December 1991, the court declined jurisdiction on account of the subject-matter of the case and indicated that the Rome magistrate (pretore), sitting as an employment judge, had jurisdiction to hear it. 12.On 13 February 1992 the applicant resumed the proceedings before the Rome magistrate. At the first hearing, on 25 November 1992, the court noted that the defendant had failed to appear and the magistrate appointed an expert, who took the oath on 15 February 1993. On 23 June 1993 the magistrate withdrew to consider the case. In a judgment of the same date, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 22 July 1993, the magistrate allowed the applicant’s claim in part. 13.On 20 July 1994 the applicant appealed to the Rome District Court. On 18 October 1994 the first hearing was set down for 4 December 1996. It was subsequently brought forward, at the applicant’s request, to 1 December 1995. It was then adjourned to 13 December 1995 because the judge preparing the case for trial was unable to attend, and then to 2 February 1996 because the registry had not sent the file relating to the first-instance proceedings. On 2 February 1996 the court appointed an expert and directed that he take the oath on 19 April 1996. That hearing was adjourned to 12 July 1996 because it had not been possible to summon the expert. On that date the court appointed a new expert because the first one had moved house and it had not been possible to summon him. The expert took the oath on 4 October 1996 and the case was adjourned to 11 June 1997. On that date the court listed the deliberations in the case for 17September 1997. In an order of 17 September 1997 the court re-opened the investigation and ordered the expert to appear at a hearing on 12November 1997 in order to clarify certain points in his report. 14.The court deliberated on 13 March 1998 and in a judgment of the same date, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 6August 1998, allowed the applicant’s appeal in part.",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

96,001-59886,Grand Chamber,"10.On 8 November 1993 the applicant commenced employment as an administrative assistant at the United States Embassy in London, in the Foreign Broadcasting Information Service, which is a subsidiary of the Central Intelligence Agency. She was dismissed from her employment in February 1995. Following her dismissal the applicant issued proceedings against the United States Government in the North London Industrial Tribunal, claiming that her dismissal had been the result of sex discrimination contrary to sections 1(1)(a), 4(1)(d) and 6(2)(b) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (see paragraph 15 below). In particular she alleged that she had been the victim of persistent sexual harassment from her supervisor and that working relationships had broken down in consequence. The United States Government defended the claim and did not, at any stage in these proceedings, claim State immunity. On 13 May 1996 the Tribunal upheld the applicant’s complaint. A compensation figure of GBP 12,000 was agreed between the parties. 11.In June 1995, whilst her first claim in the Industrial Tribunal was still pending, the applicant applied for and obtained a fixed term 12 month contract as an administrative assistant within the Foreign Building Operations section of the Embassy. The contract was due to expire in June 1996. In June 1996 and August 1996 (after the finding in her favour by the Industrial Tribunal), the applicant applied for at least two of the following posts at the Embassy of the United States: secretary with the Office of Foreign Litigation of the United States Department of Justice, temporary secretary with the above office and temporary secretary with the International Marketing Centre, which is operated by the United States Foreign Commercial Service. On each occasion her application was unsuccessful. 12.On 15 September 1996 the applicant issued a second application before the Industrial Tribunal. She claimed that the refusal of the Embassy to re-employ her in two of the above posts was a consequence of her previous successful sex discrimination claim, and accordingly constituted victimisation and discrimination within the meaning of sections 4 and 6 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. 13.By a letter of 10 January 1997, solicitors acting for the United States notified the Regional Secretary to the Industrial Tribunal that the United States Government intended to claim immunity from the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under sections 1 and 16(1)(a) of the State Immunity Act 1978 (“the 1978 Act”: see paragraph 16 below). The letter enclosed an affidavit sworn by the First Secretary at the Embassy, deposing to the fact that each of the posts for which the applicant had applied were part of the administrative and technical staff of the Embassy, and accordingly fell within the ambit of the immunity imposed by section16(1)(a) of the 1978 Act. 14.On 6 February 1997 the applicant received the advice of counsel, to the effect that the United States Government were entitled to claim immunity under the 1978 Act, and that once immunity was properly asserted there was no means by which a court or tribunal in the United Kingdom could accept jurisdiction to entertain the application. Accordingly, the applicant was advised that she had no remedy in domestic law. 15.The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (“the 1975 Act”) creates a statutory cause of action which arises when an employer treats an employee or a potential employee less favourably by reason of her sex (“sex discrimination”), or by reason of the fact that she has taken or intends to take proceedings against any person under the 1975 Act (“victimisation”). Section 1(1) of the Act defines “sex discrimination” as follows: “A person discriminates against a woman in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Act if: (a)on the ground of her sex he treats her less favourably than he treats or would treat a man ...” Section 4(1) of the Act defines “victimisation” as follows: “A person (‘the discriminator’) discriminates against another person (‘the person victimised’) in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Act if he treats the person victimised less favourably than in those circumstances he treats or would treat other persons, and does so by reason that the person victimised has: (a)brought proceedings against the discriminator or any other person under this Act, or ... (d)alleged that the discriminator or any other person has committed an act which ... would amount to a contravention of this Act or give rise to a claim under the Equal Pay Act 1970 ...” Section 6 of this Act defines the circumstances in which it is unlawful to discriminate against employees and applicants, on the grounds of sex discrimination or victimisation, as follows: “(1) It is unlawful for a person, in relation to employment by him at an establishment in Great Britain, to discriminate against a woman: (a)in the arrangements he makes for the purpose of determining who should be offered that employment, or ... (c)by refusing or deliberately omitting to offer her that employment.” (2)It is unlawful for a person, in the case of a woman employed by him at an establishment in Great Britain, to discriminate against her ... (b)by dismissing her, or subjecting her to any other detriment.” 16.The United Kingdom’s State Immunity Act 1978 provides, inter alia, as follows: “1(1)A State is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom except as provided in the following provisions of this Part of this Act. … 4(1)A State is not immune as respects proceedings relating to a contract of employment between the State and an individual where the contract was made in the United Kingdom or the work is to be wholly or partly performed there. 4(2)Subject to sub-sections (3) and (4) below, this section does not apply if-(a)at the time when the proceedings are brought the individual is a national of the State concerned; or (b)at the time when the contract was made the individual was neither a national of the United Kingdom nor habitually resident there; or (c)the parties to the contract have otherwise agreed in writing. 4(3)Where the work is for an office, agency or establishment maintained by the State in the United Kingdom for commercial purposes, sub-section (2)(a) and (b) above do not exclude the application of this section unless the individual was, at the time when the contract was made, habitually resident in that State. … 16(1)This Part of this Act does not affect any immunity or privilege conferred by the Diplomatic Privileges Act 1964 or the Consular Relations Act 1968; and:- (a)Section 4 above does not apply to proceedings concerning the employment of the member of a mission within the meaning of the Convention scheduled to the said Act of 1964 or of the member of a consular post within the meaning of the Convention scheduled to said Act of 1968. ...” 17.Article 1 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which is scheduled to the Diplomatic Privileges Act 1964 provides the following definitions: “(b)the ‘members of the mission’ are the head of the mission and the members of staff of the mission; (c)the ‘members of staff of the mission’ are the members of diplomatic staff or the administrative and technical staff, and of the service staff of the mission.... (f)the ‘members of the administrative and technical staff’ are the members of the staff of the mission employed in the administrative and technical service of the mission.” 18.The 1972 European Convention on State Immunity (“the Basle Convention”), entered into force on 11 June 1976 after its ratification by three States. It has now been ratified by eight States (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) and signed by one other State (Portugal). It entered into force in respect of the United Kingdom on 4 October 1979, and provides, inter alia: Article 5 “1.A Contracting State cannot claim immunity from the jurisdiction of a Court of another Contracting State if the proceedings relate to a contract of employment between the State and an individual where the work has to be performed in the territory of the State of the forum. >Paragraph 1 shall not apply where: (a)the individual is a national of the employing State at the time when the proceedings were brought; (b)at the time when the contract was entered into the individual was neither a national of the State of the forum nor habitually a resident in that State; or (c)the parties to the contract have otherwise agreed in writing, unless, in accordance with the law of the State of the forum, the Courts of that State have exclusive jurisdiction by reason of the subject-matter. >Where the work is done for an office, agency or other establishment referred to in Article 7, paragraphs 2(a) and (b) of the present article apply only if, at the time the contract was entered into, the individual had his habitual residence in the Contracting State which employs him.” Article 32 “Nothing in the present Convention shall affect privileges and immunities relating to the exercise of the functions of diplomatic missions and consular posts and of persons connected with them.” 19.The International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property, submitted to the General Assembly of the United Nations ((1991), II(2) YBILC 13), provides at Article 11, paragraph 1, that: “a State cannot invoke immunity ... in a proceeding which relates to a contract of employment between the State and an individual for work performed in the territory of [the host] State.” However, this provision is specifically disapplied where “the subject of the proceedings is the recruitment, renewal of employment or reinstatement of the individual” and where “the employee has been recruited to perform functions closely related to the exercise of governmental authority”. Although there is no explicit reference to employment at diplomatic or consular missions in these provisions, the commentary indicates that the latter exception was intended to apply in such a context and that all employees at such missions would be precluded from bringing suit on the basis of State immunity. 20.The Committee on State Immunity of the International Law Association adopted in 1982 its Draft Convention on State Immunity, Article IIIC of which dealt with contracts of employment and was similar in its terms to Article 5 of the Basle Convention. An amendment was added to Article IIIC at the ILA’s 1994 conference, providing for immunity to be granted where “the employee was appointed under the public (administrative) law of the foreign state such as, inter alia, members of the mission, diplomatic, consular or military staff”. In the explanatory commentary on the amendment the Committee stated that it wished “to make clear that the employment relationship of any and all diplomatic and consular staff and other members of the mission should be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the forum state”.",2001,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

138,001-110986,Grand Chamber,"8.The applicant was born in 1967 and is currently serving a prison sentence in correctional facility no.IK-19 in Tavda, in the region. A.The criminal proceedings against the applicant A.The criminal proceedings against the applicant>On 11June 1999 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of abduction involving an organised criminal group and he was placed in detention. Three days later, the relevant prosecutor ordered his detention pending trial. On 18June 1999 the applicant was officially charged. 10.On 6January 2000 he was further charged with abduction, extortion, and illegal acquisition and possession of firearms and drugs. 11.On 10March 2000 the case file was forwarded to the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow. The District Court returned the case file to the prosecutor’s office, noting that the bill of indictment was not translated fully into the Chechen language. 12.On 7April 2000 the prosecutor’s office forwarded the amended bill of indictment and the case file to the District Court, which received it on 10April 2000. A week later, it was transferred to the Kuntsevskiy District Court of Moscow. 13.The first trial hearing was scheduled for 22May 2000, but was adjourned owing to the failure of the other defendants’ counsel to appear in court, as was the following hearing, scheduled for 16June 2000. Of threesubsequent hearings, two were adjourned at the applicant’s request and one owing to the failure of the victim and witnesses to appear in court. 14.By a decision of 12September 2000 the Kuntsevskiy District Court remitted the case to the Moscow Prosecutor’s Office for an additional investigation. 15.On 9July 2001 the case file was sent to the Khamovnicheskiy District Court of Moscow for trial. The hearing scheduled for 24August 2001 was adjourned owing to the failure of the witnesses and the applicant’s counsel to appear in court. Of eight subsequent hearings scheduled between 24August 2001 and 20May 2002, two were adjourned because the applicant, who in the meantime had been released on bail (on 6July 2001), failed to appear in court, three owing to the same failure on the part of the defendants, their counsel and certain witnesses and three because the presiding judge was involved in the examination of another case. 16.By a decision of 21May 2002 the Khamovnicheskiy District Court remitted the case to the Moscow Prosecutor’s Office for further investigation. On 24July 2002, upon an appeal by the prosecutor, the Moscow City Court quashed that decision and remitted the case to the Khamovnicheskiy District Court. 17.The first hearing after the case file was returned to the Khamovnicheskiy District Court was scheduled for 13September 2002. It did not take place because the presiding judge was involved in the examination of another case. Of twenty-three subsequent hearings scheduled between 13September 2002 and 3November 2003 (the last court hearing), two did not take place because the judge was, once again, involved in the examination of another case and four because either the prosecutor or some of the defendants were ill. Requests by the parties – five by the defence, including the applicant’s counsel, and one by the prosecutor – caused another six adjournments. Nine hearings were postponed owing to the failure of several participants to appear in court. The applicant, who was back in custody at the time, did not appear on two occasions. Another adjournment occurred because the applicant’s lawyer left the courtroom without permission. One hearing was postponed for reasons not evident from the file. In February 2003 the court set aside the cases of twodefendants for independent assessment and proceeded with the examination of the applicant’s case. By a decision of 29August 2003 the court disjoined the cases against two other co-defendants. 17.The first hearing after the case file was returned to the Khamovnicheskiy District Court was scheduled for 13September 2002. It did not take place because the presiding judge was involved in the examination of another case. Of twenty-three subsequent hearings scheduled between 13September 2002 and 3November 2003 (the last court hearing), two did not take place because the judge was, once again, involved in the examination of another case and four because either the prosecutor or some of the defendants were ill.

In February 2003 the court set aside the cases of twodefendants for independent assessment and proceeded with the examination of the applicant’s case. By a decision of 29August 2003 the court disjoined the cases against two other co-defendants. 18.All the above hearings concerned procedural issues. The first hearing on the merits of the case took place on 17September 2003. At the beginning of this hearing the applicant repeatedly challenged the presiding judge by questioning her impartiality. The judge ordered that he be removed from the courtroom for improper behaviour. The applicant attempted to dismiss his lawyer. The judge, however, refused to recognise the dismissal and the applicant’s counsel continued to represent him. On 23September 2003, on 4,30and 31October 2003 and on 3November 2003 the court examined witnesses and studied the documents in the file. After the completion of the evidence and when the prosecutor and the applicant’s counsel had made their submissions, the applicant was readmitted to the courtroom to make his final statement. 18.All the above hearings concerned procedural issues.

After the completion of the evidence and when the prosecutor and the applicant’s counsel had made their submissions, the applicant was readmitted to the courtroom to make his final statement. 19.By a judgment of 24November 2003 the Khamovnicheskiy District Court convicted the applicant of abduction, extortion and illegal acquisition and possession of firearms and drugs. It sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment. The court further ordered the repayment of the bail to the applicant’s wife (see paragraph 29 below). 20.On 4 December 2003 the applicant’s counsel lodged an appeal against the trial court’s judgment. By a judgment of 18May 2004 the Moscow City Court allowed the appeal in respect of the charge of illegal acquisition and possession of drugs for lack of evidence. It upheld in substance the conviction in respect of the other charges and reduced the sentence to ten years’ imprisonment. 21.By a decision of 27November 2007 the Vyaznikovskiy Town Court of the Vladimir Region released the applicant on parole. 22.It appears that in July 2008 the applicant was again arrested on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence. He was subsequently convicted and is currently serving a prison sentence. 23.Following the applicant’s arrest on 11June 1999 (see paragraph 9 above), on 14 June 1999 the chief investigator authorised his detention pending investigation. In particular, the investigator noted that he had had regard “...to the fact that [the applicant] is suspected of having committed an extremely serious offence entailing a custodial sentence, and that, if released, he might abscond and, as a result, interfere with the establishment of the truth, or commit another offence.” 24.By a decision of 10August 1999 the prosecution authorities extended the detention of the applicant and his five co-accused until 11September 1999. The grounds invoked in the extension order were the gravity of the charges against them and the potential risks of their absconding, obstructing the course of justice, putting pressure on the witness and reoffending. 25.By decisions of 31August and 6December 1999 of the prosecution authorities, the custodial measure, in relation to all six co-accused, was prolonged until 11December 1999 and 11March 2000 respectively. The wording of the decisions was identical to that used in the decision of 10August 1999. 26. It appears that there was no formal order authorising the applicant’s detention during the period between 11March and 10May 2000. On 10May 2000 the Kuntsevskiy District Court of Moscow received the casefile fixed the trial for 22May 2000 and ruled that the defendants’ “measure of restraint should remain unchanged.” 27.On 12September 2000 the Kuntsevskiy District Court of Moscow, when remitting the case to the prosecutor’s office, ordered that the applicant and five other defendants remain in custody. The court cited no reasons for ordering such detention. On 25January 2001 the Moscow City Court upheld the decision of 12September 2000 on appeal. 28.On 26February and 23March 2001 the prosecution authorities, having reproduced the reasoning contained in the decisions of 10August and 6December 1999, extended the detention of the applicant and his coaccused until 9April and 9July 2001 respectively. 28.On 26February and 23March 2001 the prosecution authorities, having reproduced the reasoning contained in the decisions of 10August and 6December 1999, extended the detention of the applicant and his coaccused until 9April and 9July 2001 respectively. 29.On 6 July 2001 the investigator in charge ordered the applicant’s release on bail. The relevant part of the decision reads: “In view of the completion of the investigation, [the applicant] will not be able to obstruct the course of justice and his appearance in court can be secured by bail in the amount of 100,000 roubles”. “In view of the completion of the investigation, [the applicant] will not be able to obstruct the course of justice and his appearance in court can be secured by bail in the amount of 100,000 roubles”. 30.By a decision of 29 October 2002 the Khamovnicheskiy District Court, during the trial proceedings, discontinued the bail and ordered the applicant’s detention. In particular, the court noted as follows: “As follows from the material in the case file, [the applicant] is charged with a number of very serious offences entailing a custodial sentence, [and has] repeatedly tried to delay the proceedings, which is viewed by the court as an attempt to interfere with establishment of the truth, and demonstrated insolent disrespect towards the court.” 31.On 30October 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of 29October 2002. On 22 January 2003 the Moscow City Court upheld the said decision on appeal. The applicant did not attend the hearing but his lawyer was present. 31.On 30October 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of 29October 2002. On 22 January 2003 the Moscow City Court upheld the said decision on appeal. The applicant did not attend the hearing but his lawyer was present. 32.On 24 April 2003 the District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 29 July 2003. The court referred to the gravity of the charges against the applicant. The applicant’s objection that his wife and two minor children were dependent upon him was not taken into account by the court. The applicant appealed on 25April 2003. On 16June 2003 the City Court, in the absence of the applicant and his lawyer, upheld the extension on appeal. 33.On 19June 2003 the District Court further extended the applicant’s detention until 29October 2003. The court noted as follows: “Having regard to the [applicant’s] strange behaviour, and his health condition and the gravity of the charges, [the court] has doubts as to the [applicant’s] ability to understand the circumstances relevant to the present case and to testify. Pursuant to the law, ... it is decisive for the correct consideration of the case to determine the [applicant’s] psychiatric and physical condition. The [applicant’s] detention expires on 29July 2003. However, the psychiatric forensic examination requires a significant amount of time. The court considers it necessary to extend the [applicant’s] detention.” 34.The applicant lodged an appeal on 24June 2003. On 6 August 2003 the City Court, in the applicant’s absence, quashed the detention order of 19June 2003 and remitted the case to the trial court for examination on the merits. 35.By a decision of 13 August 2003 the District Court once again extended the applicant’s detention. The reason given was the gravity of the charges. An appeal lodged by the applicant on 14August 2003 was dismissed by the City Court on 2October 2003. The applicant was not present at the appeal hearing but his lawyer attended it. 35.By a decision of 13 August 2003 the District Court once again extended the applicant’s detention. The reason given was the gravity of the charges. An appeal lodged by the applicant on 14August 2003 was dismissed by the City Court on 2October 2003. The applicant was not present at the appeal hearing but his lawyer attended it. 36.By a decision of 28 October 2003 of the District Court, the applicant’s detention was once again extended, with reference to the gravity of the charges, until 19January 2004. The arguments by the defence that the applicant had a permanent place of residence in and that the examination of the case had become dilatory were not taken into account by the court. The applicant appealed on 31October 2003. He was convicted on 24November 2003 (see paragraph 19 above). The extension order was upheld on appeal on 12February 2004. The applicant’s lawyer participated in the appeal hearing but the applicant did not attend. 37.The applicant was detained in remand prison no. IZ-77/2 in between 29October 2002 and 20December 2003. He was transferred between cells on many occasions. The Government and the applicant provided differing descriptions of the applicant’s conditions of detention. 38.The Government provided the following information concerning the conditions of the applicant’s detention in remand prison no.IZ-77/2 in : table-0 39.The Government further asserted that at all times while in detention the applicant had been provided with an individual sleeping place, bed sheets and cutlery. 40.The applicant accepted the data provided by the Government as regards the cell numbers and floor surfaces of those cells in which he had been detained. He did not challenge the accuracy of the Government’s submissions as concerned the number of bunk beds per cell either. However, he claimed that at all times the cells in which he had been detained were seriously overcrowded. The number of inmates per cell had exceeded its capacity by two to three times. Each cell had housed at least thirty-five persons at any given time. The applicant had never been provided with an individual sleeping place and he had to take turns with other inmates to sleep. Some people had to sleep on the floor under the beds. Apart from one hour per day of exercise, the applicant had been confined in such conditions for the rest of each day, with the exception of the rare occasions when he had met with his lawyer or the fifteen minutes per week which were set aside for showering. 41.According to the Government, the applicant had been allowed to exercise for one hour per day. The remand prison was equipped with sixtyeight exercise yards measuring 10 square metres (sq.m) and 52.8sq.m for small and large cells respectively. The yards were arranged in such a way as to provide the inmates with the possibility of doing physical exercise. They were equipped with benches and were sheltered from the rain. 42.According to the applicant, the one-hour daily exercise took place in a yard measuring 30 sq.m. Thirty-five to one hundred inmates were taken to the yard at the same time. The yard was covered with metal bars and iron sheets which significantly limited access to daylight. 43.According to the Government, the applicant could take a shower once a week. On the same occasion he received clean bed sheets. The shower facilities functioned properly without breaking down. All the inmates were provided with buckets and detergent to do laundry. The applicant received three meals a day of adequate quality. 44.The cells were equipped with natural and artificial ventilation which was in good working order. The temperature and the humidity in the cells were in compliance with the applicable housing and hygiene standards. The cells were equipped with central heating and a cold water supply. The inmates could use electric kettles or heaters to boil water. 45.The artificial lighting in the cells was in compliance with the applicable specifications and was on from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. At night lowvoltage bulbs were used to maintain lighting in the cell. 46.In cells nos.134, 140, 141, 155, 159 and 160 the toilet was completely separated from the living area of the cell by a brick wall and a door. The distance between the toilet and the dinner table was at least two metres. The closest sleeping place was located some 1.5 m away from the toilet. 47.In cells nos. 50, 36, 43, 52 and 298 the toilet was separated from the rest of the cell by a brick wall which was 1.35 m high. The distance between the toilet and the dinner table was at least one metre. The closest sleeping place was located some 0.5 m away from the toilet. 48.The cells were disinfected once every three months or more often, if necessary. During the period of the applicant’s detention in the remand prison, there had been no complaints by him alleging, for example, the presence of rats, parasites or bedbugs. 49.The applicant contested the truthfulness of the Government’s submissions in so far as the description of the sanitary conditions of his detention was concerned. According to him, the ventilation was inadequate. Most of the inmates smoked and the applicant was exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke. There was so little oxygen in the cell that the flame of a match would go out immediately. It was practically impossible to breathe. 50.The cell windows were covered with metal sheets which prevented access to daylight. As a result, the lighting in the cell was insufficient for reading. 51.An electric light was on constantly. The cells were very noisy. The cells were also dirty and needed renovation. They were infested with cockroaches, bedbugs and lice. The toilet was located near the dinner table and offered no privacy. One had to queue to use the toilet. The food provided was scarce and of little variety. 52.The Government and the applicant disagreed as to most aspects of the conditions of detention at and transport to and from the Khamovnicheskiy courthouse. 53.The Government submitted the following information. 54.The Department of the Interior used three types of vans for transporting defendants to and from the courthouse. The ZIL van measured 4.7 m by 2.4 m by 1.64 m and had four compartments with seating capacity for thirty-six persons. The GAZ vans measured 3.8 m by 2.35 m by 1.6 m and had three compartments with seating capacity for twenty-five persons. The vans were ventilated through an opening in the door and by vents in the roof. They were equipped with heating and lighting. The vans were cleaned daily and disinfected on a weekly basis. 55.The distance between the remand prison and the courthouse was approximately seven kilometres and the travel time did not exceed one hour. 56.On the days of the court hearings, the applicant had to get up at 6a.m. and had breakfast. He was also provided with a lunch bag for the day spent at the courthouse. 57.The courthouse had six holding cells measuring 31sq.m in total. They had adequate ventilation and lighting and had metal doors with openings for surveillance purposes. The benches were secured to the floor. There was access to sanitary facilities. 58.The applicant provided the following description of the conditions of his detention in, and transport to and from, the courthouse. 59.On approximately fifteen occasions the applicant was transported from the remand prison to the courthouse and back. On those days he normally had to wake up at 5 a.m. and had no breakfast. The prison van had three compartments which measured 3.8 m by 2.35 m by 1.6 m in total. Twocompartments housed twelve persons each and the third one was for single occupancy. There were usually eighteen detainees held in each of the bigger compartments. There were not enough seats for everyone and some people had to stand or sit on someone else’s lap. The applicant was transported once in a single occupancy compartment on 24November 2003 following the delivery of the verdict in his case. 60.The natural ventilation of the van through the hatches was insufficient and it was stiflingly hot in the summer. During the winter the vans were not heated when the engines were off. The floor in the van was extremely dirty. It was covered with cigarette butts, food crumbs, plastic bottles and bags of urine. It was impossible to use the toilet during the journey. The vans had no windows or internal lighting. 60.The natural ventilation of the van through the hatches was insufficient and it was stiflingly hot in the summer. During the winter the vans were not heated when the engines were off. The floor in the van was extremely dirty. It was covered with cigarette butts, food crumbs, plastic bottles and bags of urine. It was impossible to use the toilet during the journey. The vans had no windows or internal lighting. 61.The van collected inmates from different prisons and made several stops at different courthouses. As a result, the journey from the remand prison to the courthouse for the applicant lasted between one and a half and two hours. The return journey took up to five hours. On the days of the court hearings, the applicant was not provided with any food. 62.The applicant submitted that the holding cells at the courthouse were overcrowded, dirty, poorly lit and unventilated. They measured no more than 5 sq.m. The applicant did not receive any food when he was held there. Nor was there a toilet in the cell. On at least two occasions, when the hearing of his case was adjourned, the applicant spent up to fifteen hours in such conditions. On other days he spent several hours in such cells before and after the hearing. D.Alleged ill-treatment 63.The applicant alleged that on 24November 2003 he was beaten up by the guards while he was detained at the courthouse. He attempted to bring his grievances to the attention of the trial judge but to no avail. 64.On 25January 2004 the applicant complained to the prosecutor’s office about the beating. 65.On 5April 2004 the prosecutor did not find a prima facie case of illtreatment and refused to institute criminal proceedings against the alleged perpetrator. The applicant did not appeal. 65.On 5April 2004 the prosecutor did not find a prima facie case of illtreatment and refused to institute criminal proceedings against the alleged perpetrator. The applicant did not appeal. 66.According to the applicant, on an unspecified date the decision of 5April 2004 was quashed by a superior prosecutor who ordered an additional inquiry into his allegations. On 26February 2007 the investigating prosecutor yet again dismissed the applicant’s allegations as unsubstantiated. The applicant did not appeal. 67.The applicant alleged that certain letters from the Court had been opened by the administration of correctional facility no.IK-6 in the Vladimir Region, where he was serving a prison sentence from 2004 to 2006. 68.The Government acknowledged that the Court’s letters of 8July 2005 and 11May 2006 addressed to the applicant had been opened by officials and stamped with the seal of correctional facility no.IK-6. 69.On 9August 2011 the applicant asked the administration of correctional facility no.IK-19, where he was serving a prison sentence, to send certain documents, including his just satisfaction claims and application for legal aid, to his representatives before the Court. The acting head of the internal service dispatched the documents accompanied by a covering letter, stating as follows: “Please find enclosed the [applicant’s] letter concerning a violation of his rights. ... Enclosure (11 pages). (signed)” In the applicant’s opinion, the Russian authorities, through the above acts, failed to comply with their obligations under Article34 and interfered with his right to respect for his correspondence. A.Conditions of pre-trial detention 70.Section 23 of the Detention of Suspects Act of 15 July 1995 provides that detainees should be kept in conditions which satisfy sanitary and hygiene requirements. They should be provided with an individual sleeping place and given bedding, tableware and toiletries. Each inmate should have no less than four square metres of personal space in his or her cell. 71.Moreover, detainees should be given, free of charge, sufficient food for the maintenance of good health in line with the standards established by the Government of the (section 22 of the Act). 72.According to the Code of Criminal Procedure of Russia (hereinafter, “the CCP”), at any time during the judicial proceedings the court may order, vary or revoke any preventive measure, including pre-trial detention (Article255 § 1). 73.If pre-trial detention is applied to a defendant during the judicial proceedings, its term may not normally exceed six months. However, if the case concerns serious or particularly serious criminal offences, the trial court may approve one or more extensions of no longer than three months each (Article 255§§2 and 3). An appeal against such a decision lies to a higher court (Articles 255§4). C.Coercive powers of the court 74.Article 111 of the CCP provides that in order to ensure the proper administration of criminal proceedings, the court has the power to compel the parties to the proceedings to cooperate by means of measures such as escorting them to a courtroom or imposing fines. The former can be applied to witnesses if they fail to honour a court summons without valid reasons (Article 113). A fine can be imposed on a party in the event of his or her failure to fulfil procedural obligations (Article 117). 75.Pursuant to Article 258 of the CCP, the penalties which a judge may impose on any party, including a defendant, who acts in a manner that disturbs order in the courtroom are (1) a warning, (2) removal from the courtroom, or (3) a fine. Article258§3 provides that the trial, including the parties’ closing arguments, may be conducted in the defendant’s absence. In such a case, the defendant must be brought back to the courtroom to make the final submissions. The judgment must always be delivered in the defendant’s presence. 76.Article 373 of the CCP provides that the appellate court’s role is to review a conviction with a view to verifying its lawfulness, validity and fairness. 77.Article 374 of the CCP provides that an appellate court must commence the examination of a criminal case within one month of receiving an appeal in the case. 77.Article 374 of the CCP provides that an appellate court must commence the examination of a criminal case within one month of receiving an appeal in the case. 77.Article 374 of the CCP provides that an appellate court must commence the examination of a criminal case within one month of receiving an appeal in the case. 78.Article 377 of the CCP provides as follows: “4.The appellate court may directly examine evidence, if asked to do so by the parties, in accordance with [the rules of criminal procedure applicable to the trial proceedings].>In order to substantiate or negate the arguments put forward in a statement of appeal, the parties may submit additional materials for consideration by the appellate court”. Interpreting Article377, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, in Resolution no.1 of 5March 2004 (applicable at the material time), held that such consideration of evidence was limited to a review of the evidence already assessed by the trial court, such as the reading of witnesses’ testimonies. E.Prisoners’ correspondence E.Prisoners’ correspondence 79.Article 91§2 of the Code on the Execution of Sentences and Rule53 of the Internal Regulations of Correctional Facilities, adopted on 3November 2005 by Decree No.205 of the Russian Ministry of Justice, provide that all detainees’ incoming and outgoing correspondence is subject to censorship by the administration of the correctional facility, except for correspondence with courts, prosecutors, prison service officials, the Ombudsman, the public monitoring board and the European Court of Human Rights.",2012,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

184,001-57990,Grand Chamber,"9. On 1 April 1990 Mr Benham became liable to pay a community charge of £325. Since he did not pay it, on 21 August 1990 the Poole Magistrates' Court ordered the issue of a liability order, entitling Poole Borough Council (""the charging authority"") to commence enforcement proceedings against him (see paragraph 19 below, Regulations 29 and 39(1)). 10. Mr Benham did not pay the amount owed, and bailiffs visited his parents' house (where he was living), but were told that he had no goods of any value there or elsewhere which could be seized by them and sold in order to pay the debt. 11. Under Regulation 41 of the Community Charge (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1989 (""the Regulations"": see paragraph 19 below), if a person is found to have insufficient goods on which to levy outstanding community charge the charging authority may apply to a magistrates' court for an order committing him to prison. On such an application being made, the court must inquire in the presence of the debtor as to his present means and also whether his failure to pay which led to the liability order being made was due to wilful refusal or culpable neglect. The charging authority applied for such an order, and on 25 March 1991 Mr Benham appeared at the Poole Magistrates' Court for the inquiry required by the Regulations. He was not assisted or represented by a lawyer, although he was eligible for ""Green Form"" legal advice and assistance before the hearing (see paragraph 29 below), and the magistrates could have made an order for Assistance by Way of Representation (""ABWOR"") if they had thought it necessary (see paragraph 30 below). 12. The magistrates found that Mr Benham, who had 9 ""O"" level General Certificates of Secondary Education, had started a Government Employment Training Scheme in September 1989, but had left it in March 1990 and had not worked since. He had applied for income support, but had been turned down because it is not payable to those who are voluntarily unemployed, and he had no personal assets or income. On the basis of this evidence, the magistrates concluded that his failure to pay the community charge was due to his culpable neglect, ""as he clearly had the potential to earn money to discharge his obligation to pay"". Accordingly, they decided that he ought to be sent to prison for thirty days unless he paid what was owing. Mr Benham was taken to Dorchester prison on the same day. 13. On 27 March 1991 a solicitor went on the record as representing MrBenham and lodged a notice of appeal by way of case stated (see paragraph21 below) and an application for bail pending appeal (see paragraph 22 below). Legal aid was obtained for the appeal, but not for the bail application, because it is not available for such proceedings. In the event, the solicitor appeared without payment before the magistrates on 28March 1991 to apply for bail, but he was unsuccessful. 14. On 4 April 1991 Mr Benham's solicitor lodged an application for leave to apply for judicial review and for bail in the High Court. He was obliged to ask for judicial review, despite the fact that he had already lodged an appeal by way of case stated, because otherwise he could not have applied for bail in the High Court until the magistrates had stated a case (see paragraph 22 below). Bail was granted on 5 April 1991 and Mr Benham was thus released from prison, having served eleven days. 15. The Divisional Court heard the appeal by way of case stated and the application for judicial review together on 7 and 8 October 1991 (Regina v. Poole Magistrates, ex parte Benham, 8 October 1991, unreported). MrBenham was represented and legally aided. The court noted that it had been necessary to apply for judicial review in order to get bail, but that the case stated procedure was more appropriate. Accordingly no order was made on the judicial review application. 16. Mr Justice Potts in the held that the magistrates had been mistaken in concluding that Mr Benham's failure to pay the community charge had been due to culpable neglect: ""In my view this finding was wrong on the evidence available to the justices. In certain circumstances a failure on the part of the debtor to work and put himself in funds to pay the community charge might constitute culpable neglect. In my judgment, however, before such a finding could be sustained, at the very least there would have to be clear evidence that gainful employment, for which he was fit, was on offer to the debtor and that he had rejected or refused that offer. There was no such evidence in this case. In my judgment, the justices' finding of culpable neglect cannot be sustained on the evidence adduced before them."" 17. In addition, he found that the decision to commit Mr Benham to prison would have been wrong even if there had been evidence of culpable neglect, because he did not have any means with which to pay the debt at the time of the hearing before the magistrates, and because ""[s]uch an order is only to be made if payment can be made and there is no other way of inducing the [debtor] to do so"". In the circumstances it was incumbent upon them to consider the alternatives to immediate detention provided for by the Regulations: they could have suspended the term of imprisonment subject to such conditions as they thought fit, or refused to issue a warrant, since the local authority could have renewed their application at a later date if MrBenham's circumstances had changed (see paragraph 19 below). 18. Mr Benham was not able to apply for compensation in respect of the time he spent in prison, because he was unable to show bad faith on the part of the magistrates, as was required by section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 (see paragraph 28 below). 19. The relevant subordinate legislation is the Community Charge (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1989 (Statutory Instrument 1989/438) (""the Regulations""). The relevant provisions of Regulation 29 (""application for a liability order"") are as follows: ""(1) If an amount which has fallen due ... is wholly or partly unpaid ... the charging authority may ... apply to a magistrates' court for an order against the person by whom it is payable. ... (5) The court shall make the order if it is satisfied that the sum has become payable by the defendant and has not been paid."" Regulation 39 (1) provides for the seizure and sale of a debtor's property (""levying of distress""): ""Where a liability order has been made the authority which applied for the order may levy the appropriate amount by distress and sale of goods of the debtor against whom the order was made."" Regulation 41 is concerned with the committal to prison of a debtor, and provides, so far as is relevant: ""(1) Where a charging authority has sought to levy an amount by distress under Regulation 39, the debtor is an individual, and it appears to the authority that no (or insufficient) goods of the debtor can be found on which to levy the amount, the authority may apply to a magistrates' court for the issue of a warrant committing the debtor to prison. (2) On such application being made the court shall (in the debtor's presence) inquire as to his means and inquire whether the failure to pay which led to the liability order concerned being made against him was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect. (3) If (and only if) the court is of the opinion that his failure was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect it may if it thinks fit - ... (7) The order in the warrant shall be that the debtor be imprisoned for a time specified in the warrant which shall not exceed three months, unless the amount stated in the warrant is sooner paid ..."" The relevant part of Regulation 42 provides: (3) Where an application under regulation 41 has been made but no warrant is issued or term of imprisonment fixed, the application may be renewed ... on the ground that the circumstances of the debtor have changed."" 20. In v. Highbury Corner Magistrates, ex parte Watkins (9October 1992, unreported) Mr Justice Henry said in the High Court that ""The proceedings under Regulation 41 are plainly legal proceedings other than criminal proceedings. They are proceedings for the recovery of an unpaid tax."" However, in Regina v. Hebburn Justices, ex parte Martin (31July 1995, unreported), Mr Justice Sedley in the High Court held that although the initial obligation to pay community charge was a civil one, magistrates ""who have reached the point of committal are entertaining a criminal process"". 21. By virtue of section 111 of the Magistrates' Court Act 1980 a party to proceedings before a magistrates' court may ""question the proceeding on the ground that it is wrong in law or is in excess of jurisdiction by applying to the justices composing the court to state a case for the opinion of the High Court on the question of law or jurisdiction involved ..."". This is known as the ""case stated"" procedure. 22. Under section 113 of the 1980 Act, magistrates may grant bail to a party who applies to them to state a case; but if they refuse to do so, in cases categorised as ""civil"" under the domestic law, the High Court has no jurisdiction to grant bail until it is seized of some substantive proceedings to which the grant of bail can be ancillary. 23. Acts performed pursuant to an order made by a magistrates' court which is subsequently set aside by a superior court are not themselves inherently unlawful. It is at the discretion of the higher court whether these collateral acts are also invalid: Regina v. Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, ex parte Hague [1992] 1 Appeal Cases 58, 124D-G (per Lord Justice Taylor in the Court of Appeal); London and Clydeside Estates Ltd v.Aberdeen District Council [1980] 1 Weekly Law Reports 182, 189C-190C (per Lord Hailsham, Lord Chancellor, in the House of Lords); Regina v. Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex parte Datafin PLC [1987] Queen's Bench 815, 840A-C (per Sir John Donaldson, Master of the Rolls). 24. In English law, orders of a magistrates' court which are in excess of jurisdiction are void from the outset, whereas orders made within jurisdiction remain valid until set aside by a superior court. It is only in respect of the former type of error that a court can be held civilly liable in damages (under section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which replaced section 45 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1979 - see paragraphs 27-28 below). 25. The appropriate test for whether an order of a magistrates' court is void for lack of jurisdiction is that set out by the House of Lords in McC. v.Mullan [1985] Appeal Cases 528. In that case magistrates had made an order sending a 14-year-old boy to a training school after a hearing at which he was not legally represented, had not applied for legal aid and had not been informed of his right so to do. The order was quashed on judicial review on the ground that, by virtue of Article 15 (1) of the Treatment of Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1976, magistrates were not permitted to pass a custodial sentence for the first time on a juvenile who was not legally represented, unless he had applied for legal aid and been refused on grounds of means or had been informed of his right to apply for it but had refused or neglected to do so. The boy then applied for damages for false imprisonment against the magistrates. Since the case was decided prior to the enactment of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 and at a time when it was the law that magistrates were liable in damages for false imprisonment if they acted in excess of jurisdiction (see paragraph 26 below), the House of Lords was required to decide the jurisdictional question. In its judgment, a magistrates' court acted in excess of jurisdiction in three circumstances only: (1) if it acted without having jurisdiction over the cause, (2) if it exercised its powers in a procedural manner that involved a gross and obvious irregularity, or (3) if it made an order that had no proper foundation in law because of a failure to observe a statutory condition precedent. The instant case fell within the third limb of the rule: the magistrates were liable in damages because they had not observed the requirements of Article 15 (1) of the 1976 Order. During the course of his judgment speech, commented (at page 546 E-F), on the jurisdiction of magistrates in conducting a criminal trial: ""... once justices have duly entered upon a summary trial of a matter within their jurisdiction, only something quite exceptional occurring in the course of their proceeding to a determination can oust their jurisdiction ... [A]n error (whether of fact or law) in deciding a collateral issue on which jurisdiction depends will not do so. Nor will the absence of any evidence to support a conviction ..."" 26. The final limb of the rule formulated by the House of Lords in McC.v. Mullan (that is, that magistrates exceed their jurisdiction when they make an order which has no foundation in law because of a failure to observe a statutory condition precedent) was applied by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Manchester City Magistrates' Court, ex parte Davies [1989] 1 All England Reports 30, a case concerning rates (the predecessor to the community charge). Again, the issue was whether magistrates had acted in excess of jurisdiction and were therefore liable in damages for false imprisonment. The plaintiff had been unable to pay all of the rates for which he became liable in December 1984, and in January 1986 he failed to follow his accountant's advice to close his business and to go bankrupt. Applying legislation similar to Regulation 41 of the Community Charge Regulations, the magistrates found that his failure to follow the accountant's advice constituted culpable neglect and they committed him to prison. The Court of Appeal held that no causal connection had been established between the failure to follow advice in 1986 and the failure to pay the rates in 1984, and that the magistrates had not properly entered into the inquiry (as to whether the failure to pay was due to culpable neglect) required by the legislation as a condition precedent of the warrant of commitment. They were therefore acting in excess of jurisdiction and were liable in damages. The judges expressed their findings in slightly different terms. Lord Justice O'Connor observed that ""they never carried out the inquiry required [by the law]""; Lord Justice Neill found that ""some inquiry about the applicant's finances was made"", but that ""a clear and crucial distinction can be drawn between the inquiry required by the statute and the inquiry which was in fact carried out. The justices never examined the question whether the failure to pay was due to culpable neglect""; and SirRoger Ormrod (who dissented from the majority decision) said: ""... it is quite clear that the justices carried out an inquiry into means carefully and in detail ... It is equally plain that they misdirected themselves completely ... They ... failed to realise that the question they had to decide was whether the applicant's failure to pay his rates was `due either to his wilful refusal or to his culpable neglect'"" (see pp. 637 B, 642 H-643 G and 647 E). 27. Magistrates enjoy a statutory immunity from civil liability in certain circumstances. Before the coming into force of section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 on 1 January 1991, this immunity was provided for by sections 44 and 45 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1979. In brief, a magistrate was liable in damages for acts done by him in his official capacity if it could be proved either (1) that the act was done maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause or (2) that it was performed outside or in excess of jurisdiction (see paragraph 25 above for the meaning of the latter expression). 28. The position under section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 is now that an action lies against a magistrate only if it can be proved that he acted both in bad faith and in excess of jurisdiction: ""An action shall lie against any justice of the peace ... in respect of any act or omission of his - 29. The legal-aid scheme does not provide for full representation before magistrates for proceedings for committal to prison for non-payment of the community charge. The ""Green Form"" scheme provides at least two hours' worth of advice and assistance from a solicitor (the time limit can be extended), including preparation for a court case, but it does not provide for representation. 30. Assistance by Way of Representation (""ABWOR"") enables a magistrates' court, in certain circumstances, to appoint a solicitor who happens to be within the court precincts to represent a party who would not otherwise be represented. Regulation 7 (1) (b) of the Legal Advice and Assistance (Scope) Regulations 1989 provides that ABWOR may be given: ""at a hearing in any proceedings in a magistrates' court to a party who is not receiving and has not been refused representation in connection with those proceedings, where the court -",1996,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

73,001-58848,Grand Chamber,"7.On 15 March 1984, pursuant to Law no. 833/78, which created the National Health Service and required regional governments, inter alia, to adopt appropriate measures for the prevention, screening and treatment of disabilities, the Campania Regional Council enacted Regional Law no. 11 (“the Regional Law”). Article 26 of the Regional Law authorised local public health services (Unità Sanitarie Locali – “USLs”) to grant allowances for the first three years after its entry into force to families caring for disabled members of their household directly in their own homes.>On 5 December 1989 the Management Committee (Comitato di gestione) of Benevento USL no. 5, applying Article 26 of the Regional Law, decided that 134 persons, including the applicant's son, satisfied the conditions entitling their families to payment of the allowance. The decision authorised only distribution to qualifying beneficiaries, depending on the date when they had been recognised as 100% disabled, of the sum of 35,328,240 Italian lire (ITL) for the year 1985; the applicant received ITL84,720 in respect of the months of November and December 1985.>By a notice to pay served on 12 June 1993, the applicant asked Benevento USL no. 5 to grant him the allowance. He pointed out that the placing of his son's name on the list of persons who satisfied the conditions required by the Regional Law for entitlement to the allowance had not been followed by the payment provided for in Article 26 of the Regional Law. 10.As the USL did not reply, the applicant brought proceedings against it in the Campania Regional Administrative Court (“the RAC”) on 2 August 1993. Relying on Article 26 of the Regional Law, he sought a declaration that the lack of an answer from the USL – amounting to a refusal – had been unlawful and that he was entitled to the allowance in question for the years 1985, 1986 and 1987. 11.On 13 August 1993 the applicant requested that a date be fixed for the hearing. On 27 July 1995 he submitted an urgent request for a hearing date to be fixed, observing, inter alia, that the USLs were to be restructured on 31December 1995 and that Italian legislation made no provision for financial continuity between the old entities and the new ones. He was therefore asking for his case to be set down because after the end of 1995 he would no longer be able to obtain the allowance he sought. In a pleading filed on a date which has not been specified, USL no. 5 submitted, among other arguments, that it did not have capacity to defend the action (legittimazione passiva), on the ground that only the Region was required to make available the financial resources needed for payment of the allowance. It maintained that the applicant, who had received the allowance for the year 1985, within the limits of the budgetary appropriations, should have challenged the decision of 5 December 1989, but as he had not done so it had become final and the amount paid could no longer be called into question. 12.The case was heard on 14 January 1997. In a judgment of 14 January and 4 February 1997, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 3March 1997, the RAC observed in the first place that the applicant was not required to challenge the decision in issue as it did not contain a refusal to pay the full amount of the allowance. On the contrary, there had been two valid alternative ways of interpreting the USL's conduct. For example, the applicant could have thought the USL was making a payment on account, while reserving final determination of the amount to be paid for a later assessment, or that it had decided to pay a larger sum with an initial instalment to be followed by others. On the merits, the RAC held that, once it had been verified that the statutory conditions for entitlement to the allowance had been satisfied, it should be paid in the quantum provided for in Article 26. The administrative authority thus had no discretionary power and its role should have been restricted to making a purely arithmetical calculation. The applicant had duly established that he was the father of a 100% disabled civilian living with his family; moreover, his son's name was the 95th in the list included in the decision of 5 December 1989. The USL should therefore have ruled on his application. However, as the Court of Cassation had stated when determining a dispute over jurisdiction (judgment no. 8297 of 11 October 1994), the applicant could not claim to have a “personal right” (diritto soggettivo perfetto) but only a “legitimate interest” (interesse legittimo), that is to say an individual position indirectly protected as far as was consistent with the public interest, which would remain the case until such time as the administrative authority adopted a decision to award the allowance and specified the total amount to be paid. The RAC therefore dismissed the applicant's action in so far as it concerned recognition of his entitlement to the allowance in question. 13.On 20 June and 5 July 1997 respectively USL no. 5 and the Campania Regional Council appealed to the Consiglio di Stato. By a decision of 30 August 1997 the Consiglio di Stato stayed execution of the first-instance judgment. 14.On 14 November 1997 the Director-General of the ASL (Azienda Sanitaria Locale), the body which had taken the place of the USL, approved the text of a friendly settlement reached on 7 November between the administrative authority and the applicant, among others. Noting that in numerous similar cases the competent courts had nearly always recognised that the plaintiffs were entitled to the allowance for the years 1985-87, further noting that the settlement had been signed after it had been verified that the conditions required by the Regional Law had been satisfied, and having regard to the fact that the settlement was about to put an end to a high-profile case which would in all probability have gone against the administrative authority, given the line the courts had taken on the question, so that the public purse would be saved billions of lire, the Director-General ordered payment of the allowance. By a judgment of 25 November 1997, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 27 December 1997, the Consiglio di Stato took formal note of the friendly settlement the parties had reached and struck the case out of its list. 15.The allowance for the families of disabled civilians is governed by Article 26 of Regional Law no. 11 of 15 March 1984, the relevant parts of which provide: “For three years after the entry into force of the present Law, local public health services shall be authorised to grant an allowance to families who undertake to provide direct care for persons suffering from mental or physical disabilities who are incapable of attending to their own primary needs and require constant assistance. The allowance shall be granted in pursuance of the following objectives: (a)returning to their families disabled people formerly in full-time institutional care; (b)encouraging the practice of caring for disabled children within the family ...; (c)socialising the disabled person and improving his relations with those around him; (d)improving the lives of the families of disabled persons; (e)creating a favourable environment for the life of the disabled person; ... The amount of the family carers' allowance shall be 25% of the daily charge for attendance on persons hospitalised full-time.” 16.The Court of Cassation has given a number of rulings on the carers' allowance in connection with appeals on points of law concerning disputes over jurisdiction. 17.For example, in judgment no. 5386 of 12 May 1993 it held that, where the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts had been recognised in a decision which had become final, disputes concerning Article 26 of the Regional Law fell into the category of disputes over mandatory assistance, which came within the jurisdiction of the magistrate's court, sitting as an employment tribunal. In judgment no. 8297 of 11 October 1994 it held that the administrative courts had jurisdiction over disputes about entitlement to the allowance, ruling that the beneficiary could not claim to have a personal right but only a legitimate interest, that is to say an individual position indirectly protected as far as was consistent with the public interest, and that this would remain the case until such time as the administrative authority adopted a decision to award the allowance and specified the total amount to be paid. The appellants in these two cases were in a similar situation to MrMennitto, but had applied to the ordinary courts. 18.The Campania RAC has upheld on many occasions the claims of other persons caring for disabled relatives. In its judgment no. 251, deposited with the registry on 16 May 1995, it ruled: “[The Court] declares that the claimant is entitled to receive the allowance provided for in Article 26 of [the Regional Law] ...; Orders the respondent authority to pay the sum in question ...” In that decision and in others (such as judgment no. 310 of 4 July 1995 and judgments nos. 323 and 324 of 6 February and 11 June 1996) the RAC gave the following reasons for its ruling: “[Article 26 of the Regional Law] makes adoption of the decision to grant the allowance subject, among other requirements, to verification that beneficiaries satisfy the relevant qualifying conditions. When such verification had been made, determination of the amount to be paid should have required no more than a simple arithmetical calculation ... In the light of these principles ..., exercise of the discretionary power pleaded by the USL has no bearing on the case, since otherwise it would be possible for an administrative decision to replace an assessment already ineluctably made by the legislature ...” After finding that G.C. (the relative of the claimant in that case) was 100% disabled and required constant assistance, which was why, following tests carried out by the respondent authority, his name had been placed on the list of qualifying beneficiaries, the RAC ruled that there was an obligation to pay the allowance. 19.The Consiglio di Stato, ruling on the question of determination of the amount of the allowance, held that the Region could not be absolved from the obligation to make available to each USL a sum earmarked for families providing direct care to disabled persons and sufficiently large to ensure that each of these families would be able to receive the amount of allowance prescribed by law (judgment no. 766 of 3 October 1994). In its judgment no. 172 of 17 February 1999 the Consiglio di Stato ruled that the amount of the allowance for families caring directly for disabled persons, in so far as it was fixed by law, could not suffer any reduction by the administrative authority, which in this matter had no discretion whatever with regard to quantum, and that that conclusion was not in contradiction with the nature of the legitimate interest of the disabled person's family.",2000,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

181,001-80249,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicants were born in 1955, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1937, 1957, 1983 and 1981 respectively and live in Sonkakoski and Sonkajärvi. 10.The first five applicants and the late Mr Hannu Matti Lappalainen worked in the Sonkajärvi Police District. Under a collective agreement concluded in 1986, they were entitled to a remote-area allowance, which was added to their salaries as a bonus for working in a remote part of the country. The amounts of the allowance were calculated on the basis of a given area’s remoteness. By a collective agreement concluded on 15 March 1988, the remote-area allowance was abolished. This would have resulted in a reduction of the salary payable to civil servants whose duty station was Sonkajärvi. In order to prevent such a reduction, the collective agreement granted them monthly individual wage supplements from 1 March 1988. 11.On 1 November 1990 the Sonkajärvi Police District was incorporated into the Iisalmi Police District by a decision of the Ministry of the Interior (sisäasiainministeriö, inrikesministeriet). Following the incorporation, the applicants’ duty station changed. They also lost their individual wage supplements and the length of their commute allegedly increased by up to 50 km per day as they had to travel from Sonkajärvi to Iisalmi. 12.According to the applicants, following their request of 17 October 1990 to that effect, the Kuopio Provincial Police Command (läänin poliisijohto, länspolisledningen) promised that their loss would be compensated. 13.On 25 March 1991 the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior, at the request of the Provincial Police Command, submitted a request for authorisation for the payment of monthly individual wage supplements, amounting to between 500 and 700 Finnish marks (FIM) (84118 euros) per person, to those police officers and other personnel whose duty station had been changed from Sonkajärvi to Iisalmi. The request referred to an allegedly analogous case (the Mäntyharju case) in which the Ministry of Finance (valtiovarainministeriö, finansministeriet) had granted a request for individual wage supplements on 29 December 1989. On 3 July 1991 the Ministry of Finance replied that it could not grant such authorisation. It gave no reasons for its refusal. 14.On 1 October 1992 competence to decide on wage supplements in respect of local police forces was transferred to the County Administrative Boards (lääninhallitus, länsstyrelsen). 15.On 19 March 1993 the applicants lodged an application requesting that they be compensated for their loss. They referred to the above decision in the Mäntyharju case. They also relied on the principle of equality as laid down in Article 5 of the Constitution then in force (Suomen hallitusmuoto, Regeringsform för Finland; Law no. 94/1919). 16.Four years later, on 19 March 1997, the request was rejected by the Kuopio County Administrative Board. It reasoned: “The civil servants of the former Sonkajärvi Police District ... have ... requested compensation for the losses arising from the incorporation of police districts, in response to which the Provincial Police Command, endorsing the request, submitted documents to the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior. By a letter of 25March 1991, the Ministry of the Interior recommended to the Ministry of Finance the retroactive payment from 1 November 1990 of individual wage supplements to those civil servants whose duty station, after the incorporation, is Iisalmi. By a letter of 3 July 1991, [the Ministry of Finance] informed the Ministry of the Interior that it had found that it could not grant the request. Following the [Ministry of Finance’s] decision, competence to decide on individual wage supplements was transferred to the County Administrative Boards. On 28January 1993, in a negotiation meeting held by the Provincial Police Command at which the applicants were represented by Mr Lappalainen, it was noted that negotiations were pending with regard to the Askola Police District in , which was a corresponding case. As [the Ministry of Finance], which had the relevant competence, had already decided the claims concerning the Sonkajärvi Police District, it was concluded that, on grounds of fairness, the decision in Uusimaa would be adhered to in Kuopio County were it to depart from the view of the Ministry of Finance. The Uusimaa County Administrative Board rejected the application and the decision was upheld by the . No new grounds have been presented in the letter of 19 March 1993, or in Mr Pallonen’s [further and] separate claim of 17 August 1994, to support the claims which have already been decided [by the Ministry of Finance]. The County Administrative Board has not learned of any positive decisions regarding compensation in corresponding cases as regards the incorporation of police districts anywhere in the country following the above-mentioned [Ministry of Finance’s] decision. In 1990, when the incorporation took place, the Provincial Police Command lacked competence to make any binding promises as regards the compensation of costs. Its view had been shown through its support of the application. The County Administrative Board, using its discretion and basing itself on the earlier decision by the competent authority, considers that the decision has acquired a certain res judicata effect. Emphasising the principles of equality and fairness, the County Administrative Board also bases itself on the prevalent practice throughout the country.” 17.Meanwhile, in December 1996 one of the applicants lodged a complaint with the Chancellor of Justice (oikeuskansleri, justitiekanslern) who, in his decision of 24 January 1997, drew attention to the fact that the applicants had still not received any answer to their application. 18.On 25 April 1997 the applicants appealed against the County Administrative Board’s decision and requested an oral hearing which, they asserted, would make it possible to establish the facts of the case, in particular that a promise had been made by the Provincial Police Command. The Kuopio County Administrative Court (lääninoikeus, länsrätten) received replies to the appeal from the Provincial Police Command and the Provincial State Attorney (lääninasiamies, länsombudet), and these were communicated to the applicants for comment. 19.By a decision of 8 June 1998, the reasoned: “Rectification of wage increases affecting pensions falls outside the ’s competence. It is not necessary to receive oral testimony from the parties as regards the Provincial Police Command of the County Administrative Board’s promises concerning the incorporation of police districts, or on how the case has been otherwise handled, in order to clarify the case. In its letter of 25 March 1991, the Ministry of the Interior proposed to the Ministry of Finance that the Sonkajärvi Police District be incorporated into the Iisalmi Police District from 1 November 1990 [in fact, the Ministry of the Interior recommended payment, not incorporation] and that the inconvenience caused by the change of duty station be compensated in the form of a wage supplement of FIM 500 to 700 per month, retroactively from 1 November 1990. In its letter of 3 July 1991, the Ministry of Finance considered that it could not grant the request. Negotiations were held between the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior and the Police Association [Suomen Poliisiliitto ry] on 3 September 1992 and between the Provincial Police Command of the Kuopio County Administrative Board and the applicants’ representative on 28 January 1993. Pursuant to Article 9 § 2 of the State Collective Agreement Decree (as amended on 18 September 1992), the County Administrative Board has competence to decide on wage supplements in respect of ... civil servants in the local police forces. The County Administrative Board must be considered to have examined the applicants’ ... submission dated 19 March 1993 as a rectification request, referred to in section 84 of the State Civil Servants Act. The rectification request has been lodged within the time laid down by section 95(1) of the State Civil Servants Act, if calculated from the Ministry of Finance’s decision of 3 July 1991. In 1990 the Provincial Police Command of the County Administrative Board lacked competence to give any binding promises pertaining to compensation. Competence to decide the matter lay at that time with the Ministry of Finance, which in its letter of 3July 1991 had stated that it considered that it could not accede to the request. Since 1 October 1992 the County Administrative Board has had competence to decide on the wages of local police. The County Administrative Board has in its decision, subject to appeal, based itself on the decision by the former competent authority and on the fact that after 3 July 1991 no compensation had been awarded to personnel in other cases in which incorporation had taken place. The decision is therefore based on the prevalent practice at that time in the entire country. The decision cannot be considered unreasonable in those circumstances. It has been possible to dismiss the request for rectification.” 20.On 7 July 1998 the applicants appealed further, requesting an oral hearing and emphasising that similar wage supplements had been granted to personnel from other police districts in corresponding situations. They relied, for example, on a decision of 10 January 1997 by the Pohjois-Karjala County Administrative Board, granting a police officer an individual wage supplement from 1 December 1996 following incorporation of the Valtimo Police District into the Nurmes Police District. 21.On 27 April 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen), having received observations from the Provincial Police Command and the Provincial State Attorney and having communicated them to the applicants for comment, upheld the lower court’s decision. It reasoned: “The has examined the case. The promises made by the Provincial Police Command of the Kuopio County Administrative Board as regards compensation for costs arising from the incorporation of police districts have no legal relevance to the case. Thus, the holding of an oral hearing is manifestly unnecessary. Accordingly, the , having regard to section 38(1) of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act, refuses [the appellants’] request for an oral hearing. In their letter of 19 March 1993, [the appellants] requested compensation in the form of individual wage supplements of costs arising from the incorporation of their police district. On 1 October 1992 competence to decide on wages in respect of local police forces was transferred to the County Administrative Board pursuant to section 9(2) of the State Collective Agreement Decree (as amended on 18 September 1992). [The appellants] have no statutory right to the individual wage supplement in question. The Kuopio County Administrative Board has not overstepped its margin of appreciation. The County Administrative Board’s decision is not in breach of the law. Therefore, the , having regard to section 7(1) of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act, finds that there is no reason to amend the outcome of the County Administrative Board’s decision, which accordingly remains final.” 22.The implementing instruction of 26 April 1988 on the application of the collective agreement with regard to the payment of a cold-area allowance to civil servants provided: “A civil servant working (before 29 February 1988) in a municipality not covered by the new collective agreement is entitled to an individual wage supplement ... as long as he or she is working in the municipality giving rise to an entitlement to such an allowance. Where a civil servant entitled to an individual wage supplement is ordered, temporarily or as a substitute, to perform the duties of another civil servant, or where his or her duty station is transferred to a municipality in which the previous remote-area allowance has not been paid, the said civil servant will not be paid the individual wage supplement during the period he or she is performing those other duties because, in order to receive the wage supplement, the civil servant has to perform his or her duties in a municipality giving rise to entitlement to the wage supplement.” According to the applicants, this instruction was not relevant to the present case, in that it allegedly concerned only temporary transfers, whereas the transfer of the applicants’ place of duty had been of a permanent nature. 23.In its request of 25 March 1991, the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior referred to an allegedly analogous case in which the Ministry of Finance had on 29 December 1989 granted a request for individual wage supplements following the incorporation of the Pertunmaa Police District into that of the Mäntyharju Police District (the Mäntyharju case). 24.On 3 July 1991 the Ministry of Finance refused a request for compensation for commuting costs lodged by a civil servant whose duty station had changed following the incorporation of the Askola Police District into that of the Mäntsälä and Porvoo Police District. The decision was upheld by the Uusimaa County Administrative Board and the on 7 April 1993 and 7 December 1994 respectively. 25.By a decision of 10 January 1997, the Pohjois-Karjala County Administrative Board granted a police officer a cold-area allowance at level1 plus an individual wage supplement compensating for the difference between level 2 (Valtimo) and level 1 (Nurmes) of the cold-area allowance following the incorporation of the Valtimo Police District into the Nurmes Police District (the Nurmes case). 26.Section 38(1) of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act (hallintolainkäyttölaki, förvaltningsprocesslagen; Law no. 586/1996) provides that an oral hearing must be held if requested by a private party. An oral hearing may however be dispensed with if a party’s request is ruled inadmissible or immediately dismissed or if an oral hearing would be clearly unnecessary due to the nature of the case or other circumstances. 27.The explanatory report on the Government Bill (no. 217/1995) for the enactment of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act examines the right to an oral hearing as provided by Article 6 of the Convention and the possibility in administrative matters to dispense with the hearing when it would be clearly unnecessary, as stated in section 38(1) of the said Act. It notes that an oral hearing contributes to a focused and immediate procedure but since it does not always bring any added value, it must be ensured that the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the administrative procedure is not undermined. An oral hearing is to be held when it is necessary for the clarification of the issues and the hearing can be considered beneficial for the case as a whole. 28.The international law and practice from which the Court sought guidance in Pellegrin v. France ([GC], no. 28541/95, ECHR 1999VIII) has been outlined in that judgment (see §§ 37-41). 29.Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, proclaimed on 7 December 2000, on the right to an effective remedy and a fair trial, provides: “Everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the Union are violated has the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal in compliance with the conditions laid down in this Article. Everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal previously established by law. Everyone shall have the possibility of being advised, defended and represented. Legal aid shall be made available to those who lack sufficient resources in so far as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice.” 30.The Explanations relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, originally prepared under the authority of the Praesidium of the Convention which drafted the Charter and finally integrated in the Final Act of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, do not have equal authority to the Charter. However, they are a “valuable tool of interpretation intended to clarify the provisions of the Charter”. They read as follows (extract): “The second paragraph [of Article 47] corresponds to Article 6(1) of the ECHR which reads as follows: In Union law, the right to a fair hearing is not confined to disputes relating to civil law rights and obligations. That is one of the consequences of the fact that the Union is a community based on the rule of law as stated by the Court in Case 294/83, ‘Les Verts’ v. European Parliament (judgment of 23 April 1986, [1988] ECR 1339). Nevertheless, in all respects other than their scope, the guarantees afforded by the ECHR apply in a similar way to the Union.” It follows that Article 47, in the context of European Union law, is not confined to civil rights and obligations or to criminal matters within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. In this respect the Charter codified existing case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities (see Marguerite Johnston v. Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Case 222/84, [1986] ECR 1651, referred to in paragraph 60 below).",2007,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

"
128,001-59887,Grand Chamber,"7.The applicant is a police officer (garda). At 11 p.m. on 4 March 1991, when off-duty, the applicant and two passengers, in a private car (described in subsequent police reports as a “jeep”) towing a van on a trailer, crossed from Northern Ireland into Ireland at a United Kingdom permanent vehicle checkpoint in County Derry. Precisely what occurred that night is disputed between the parties. It is not, however disputed that the applicant accidentally drove his car into the checkpoint barrier. The check-point was manned by armed British soldiers, one of whom, a corporal in the British Royal Military Police, approached the applicant after the accident. The Government contend that he asked the applicant to stop and was ignored. The applicant alleges that he did stop and that the soldier then waved him on. In any event, it would appear that the soldier moved towards the car and was hit by the vehicle being towed. He was thrown forward on to the tow-bar and dragged for a short distance until he managed to pull himself up into a standing position on the tow-bar. The applicant maintains that he was unaware of the soldier’s position and continued driving into Ireland. According to the report completed by the Irish Police in April 1991 following their investigation into the incident (see paragraph 9 below), the soldier fired six shots, one of which entered the car’s exhaust pipe, another of which went through the back windscreen and exited through the roof. The Government claim that some, at least, of these shots were fired in Northern Ireland. According to the applicant he heard the shots and, fearing a terrorist attack, continued driving until he reached a police station, where he considered he would be safe. He stopped the car about two miles from the border, in the village of Muff, in County Donegal, Ireland. According to the police report, at this stage the soldier, described by witnesses as in a state of “blind panic”, ordered the applicant and the two passengers to get out of the car and stand against the wall with their hands in the air. The applicant alleges that he turned to face the soldier, intending to explain that he was a police officer and that there was no cause for alarm. Again, according to the applicant, the soldier then aimed his gun at him and pulled the trigger twice, although the shots did not fire because the gun jammed.>The Irish police had been notified of the incident at the border and soon arrived at Muff. The applicant was arrested on suspicion of driving having consumed excess alcohol. He refused to comply with police requests to provide blood and urine samples.>As mentioned above, the Irish Police carried out an inquiry into the incident in the course of which 71 witnesses were interviewed. In his report the investigating officer concluded that the applicant had shown “a regrettable degree of recklessness” in leaving the scene of the accident at the check-point. The report continued: “This was a most serious incident and one which could have resulted in the serious injury or death of one or more persons. First of all the soldier was at great risk, had he fallen off the draw-bar. The three occupants of the jeep may well have been shot by [the soldier] or his colleagues at the check-point. The safety of the bystanders at Muff was also put in jeopardy resulting from the presence of the armed and terrified soldier.This matter has been vigorously and thoroughly investigated and the only conceivable reason that I can find that would prompt Garda McElhinney to deliberately leave the scene of the accident would be because he was intoxicated ...”. The applicant was subsequently prosecuted and convicted in Ireland for his refusal to provide blood and urine samples. No disciplinary proceedings were taken against him, but he was transferred to another area. 10.The applicant alleges that he feared for his life and suffered severe post-traumatic shock as a result of the above incident. On 29 June 1993 he lodged an action in the Irish High Court against the individual soldier and the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. He claimed damages, including exemplary and punitive damages, in respect of his allegation that the soldier had wrongfully assaulted him by pointing a loaded gun at him and pulling the trigger. 11.On 5 November 1993 the United Kingdom Government’s solicitors wrote to the applicant’s solicitors as follows: “... The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland bears no responsibility for the actions of the first defendant who is a soldier in the British Armed Forces under the authority of the Secretary of State for Defence in the United Kingdom and accordingly the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is not a proper defendant to these proceedings. Even if the Secretary of State was the proper defendant, both it and [the soldier] contend that they are exempt from the jurisdiction of the Irish courts on the basis of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. If your client considers that he does have a valid claim there is nothing to prevent him from pursuing it in Northern Ireland against the proper body. ...” The applicant’s solicitors replied in a letter dated 3 December 1993: “... We have also sought advice on the issue of foreign sovereign immunity raised by you and have been advised that, in these circumstances, no such immunity would apply. That being so, our client prefers to seek his redress in the courts of this jurisdiction where the incident in question occurred. ...” 12.On 13 January 1994 the applicant applied for permission to substitute for the second defendant the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Defence. On 21 January 1994 the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, claiming sovereign immunity, applied for the summons to be set aside. 13.On 15 April 1994 a High Court judge granted the Secretary of State’s request, on the ground that the applicant was not entitled to bring an action in the Irish courts against a member of a foreign sovereign government. 14.The applicant appealed, arguing, first, that the doctrine of sovereign immunity did not apply to claims for damages for personal injury caused by torts taking place within the forum State’s jurisdiction. Secondly, he submitted that the principle of reciprocity should apply to prevent the Irish court granting immunity to the United Kingdom in circumstances in which British courts, applying the State Immunity Act 1978, would not grant immunity to Ireland. Thirdly, he put forward the argument that, even if the doctrine of state immunity applied, it should yield in his case since he alleged an infringement of the constitutionally protected right to bodily integrity. 15.The Supreme Court gave judgment on 15 December 1995, rejecting the applicant’s appeal. The applicant had relied on the Supreme Court’s judgment in Government of Canada v. the Employment Appeals Tribunal (1992) 2 IR 484, but the court held that that judgment was authority only for the proposition that the doctrine of immunity did not apply in respect of commercial or trading activities carried out by a foreign government. The facts alleged by the applicant did not relate to any commercial activity, and it was not established that, as a principle of public international law, immunity no longer applied in respect of personal injuries caused by the tortious act of a foreign State’s servant or agent acting within the sphere of sovereign activity (“de jure imperii”). In his judgment, Chief Justice Hamilton, with whom Justices O’Flaherty and Blayney agreed, observed: “There can be no doubt but that the first defendant [the soldier] in carrying out his duties at the said checkpoint was acting within the sphere of governmental or sovereign activity and the acts complained of must be regarded as ‘jure imperii’ even though alleged to have been committed within this jurisdiction. It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that, as the acts complained of were tortious and caused personal injuries to him, the principle of foreign sovereign immunity should not apply to such acts and that it was a near-universally recognised principle of international law that claims for personal injuries allegedly inflicted in the forum state by or on behalf of a foreign government constitute an exception to the sovereign immunity principle. In support of such submission, counsel for the plaintiff referred in particular to the United Kingdom State Immunity Act 1978; the Canadian State Immunity Act 1982; the Australian Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act 1985 and the European Convention on State Immunity 1972. ... The plaintiff relies on these statutes as indicative of a recognised principle of public international law. ... Distinction must be drawn between the provisions of legislation in a number of states and the provisions of public international law, and the principles set forth in individual state legislation cannot be regarded as establishing principles of public international law. The provisions of statutes cannot be used as evidence of what international law is: statutes are evidence of the domestic law in the individual states and not evidence of international law generally. Article 11 of the European Convention on State Immunity provides that:- ‘A Contracting Party cannot claim immunity from the jurisdiction of a court of another contracting party in proceedings which relate to redress for injury to the person or damage to tangible property, if the facts which occasioned the injury or damage occurred in the territory of the State of forum, and if the author of the injury or damage was present in that territory at the time when those facts occurred.’ I do not have to decide, in the circumstances of this case, whether the terms of the Convention are part of the domestic law of this State because even if it were, the plaintiff’s claim herein would fail by virtue of the terms of Article 31 of the said Convention, which provides that:- ‘Nothing in this Convention shall affect any immunities or privileges enjoyed by a Contracting Party in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by, or in relation to its armed forces when on the territory of another Contracting State.’ The terms of Article 31 recognise that, as a matter of international law, immunities and privileges in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by or in relation to armed forces, when on the territory of another Contracting State, exist. ... Despite the Herculean efforts of the plaintiff’s legal advisers in making available to the court copies of all relevant decisions, articles and draft Conventions, and the cogent arguments of counsel, I am not satisfied that it is a principle of public international law that the immunity granted to sovereign states should be restricted by making them liable in respect of tortious acts, committed on their behalf by their servant or agent, causing personal injuries to the person affected by such act or omission, when such act or omission is committed jure imperii and I would dismiss the appeal on this point ...” 16.The applicant did not pursue his action against the individual soldier who had allegedly assaulted him. 17.In his judgment in the Government of Canada case (cited in paragraph15 above), Justice Hederman described the position of sovereign immunity in Irish law as follows: “The doctrine of sovereign immunity is one of the generally recognised principles of international law, which, by Article 29, s.3 of the Constitution, Ireland has accepted as its rule of conduct in its relations with other states .... [T]he Oireachtas [the National Parliament] has never sought to qualify or modify this position ...”. 18.The 1972 European Convention on State Immunity (“the Basle Convention”), entered into force on 11 June 1976 after its ratification by three States. It has now been ratified by eight States (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) and signed by one other State (Portugal), but has not been signed or ratified by Ireland. It provides in Article 11: “A Contracting Party cannot claim immunity from the jurisdiction of a court of another Contracting Party in proceedings which relate to redress for injury to the person or damage to tangible property, if the facts which occasioned the injury or damage occurred in the territory of the State of the forum, and if the author of the injury or damage was present in that territory at the time when those facts occurred. ” Article 31 of the same Convention provides: “Nothing in this Convention shall affect any immunities or privileges enjoyed by a Contracting Party in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by or in relation to its armed forces on the territory of another Contracting State.” 19.The International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property, submitted to the General Assembly of the United Nations ((1991), II(2) YBILC 13), provides at Article 12 that: “... a State cannot invoke immunity from jurisdiction before a court of another State which is otherwise competent in a proceeding which relates to pecuniary compensation for death or injury to the person, or damage to or loss of tangible property, caused by an act or omission which is alleged to be attributable to the State, if the act or omission occurred in whole or in part in the territory of that other State and if the author of the act or omission was present in that territory at the time of the act or omission.” In its commentary on that passage, the ILC noted that the “physical injury ... appears to be confined to insurable risks. The areas of damage envisaged in Article 12 are mainly concerned with accidental death or physical injuries to persons ... involved in traffic accidents ... Essentially, the rule of non-immunity will preclude the possibility of the insurance company hiding behind the cloak of State immunity and evading its liability to the injured individuals.”",2001,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT
HOLDS BY TWELVE VOTES TO FIVE THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION.

42,001-58921,Grand Chamber,"9.Mr Fikri Sali Hasan (“the first applicant”) was Chief Mufti of the Bulgarian Muslims from 1992 until the events complained of. Mr Ismail Ahmed Chaush (“the second applicant”) was formerly a teacher at the Islamic Institute in Sofia. In his submissions to the Court the second applicant stated that from February 1995 he had also worked on a part-time basis as secretary to the Chief Mufti's Office (Главно мюфтийство), the national leadership of the Muslim religious organisation, and editor of Musulmanin, its newspaper. The Government disputed these assertions. 10.At the end of 1989 a process of democratisation commenced in Bulgaria. Soon thereafter some Muslim believers and activists of the Muslim religion in the country sought to replace the leadership of their religious organisation. They considered that Mr Gendzhev, who was the Chief Mufti at that time, and the members of the Supreme Holy Council (Висш духовен съвет) had collaborated with the communist regime. The old leadership, with Mr Gendzhev as Chief Mufti of the Bulgarian Muslims, also had supporters. This situation caused divisions and internal conflict within the Muslim community in Bulgaria. 11.Following general elections held in Bulgaria in October 1991 a new government, formed by the Union of Democratic Forces (СДС) and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (ДПС), took office towards the end of 1991. On 10 February 1992 the Directorate of Religious Denominations (Дирекция по вероизповеданията), a governmental agency attached to the Council of Ministers, declared the election of Mr Gendzhev in 1988 as Chief Mufti of the Bulgarian Muslims null and void and proclaimed his removal from that position. On 21 February 1992 the Directorate registered a threemember Interim Holy Council as a temporary governing body of the Muslims' religious organisation, pending the election of a new permanent leadership by a national conference of all Muslims. 12.Following these events Mr Gendzhev, who claimed that he remained Chief Mufti of the Bulgarian Muslims, challenged the decision of 10February 1992 before the Supreme Court. On 28 April 1992 the Supreme Court rejected his appeal. The court found that the decision of the Directorate of Religious Denominations was not subject to judicial appeal. The ensuing petition for review, submitted by Mr Gendzhev against the Supreme Court's decision, was examined by a five-member Chamber of the Supreme Court. On 7 April 1993 the Chamber dismissed the petition. While confirming the rejection of Mr Gendzhev's appeal, the Chamber also discussed the merits of the appeal. It found, inter alia, that the Directorate's decision to declare MrGendzhev's election null and void had been within its competence. In so far as the impugned decision had also proclaimed “the removal” of MrGendzhev from his position of Chief Mufti, this had been ultra vires. However, it was unnecessary to annul this part of the Directorate's decision as in any event it had no legal consequences. 13.The National Conference of Muslims, organised by the interim leadership, took place on 19 September 1992. It elected Mr Fikri Sali Hasan (the first applicant) as Chief Mufti of the Bulgarian Muslims and also approved a new Statute of the Religious Organisation of Muslims in Bulgaria (Устав за духовното устройство и управление на мюсюлманите в България). On 1October 1992 the Directorate of Religious Denominations registered the statute and the new leadership in accordance with sections 6 and 16 of the Religious Denominations Act. 14.While the leadership dispute between Mr Gendzhev and Mr Hasan continued, the official position of the Directorate of Religious Denominations, throughout 1993 and at least the first half of 1994, remained that the first applicant was the legitimate Chief Mufti of the Bulgarian Muslims. 15.On 29 July 1994 the Directorate of Religious Denominations wrote a letter to Mr Hasan urging him to organise a national conference of all Muslims to solve certain problems arising from irregularities in the election of local religious leaders. The irregularities in question apparently concerned alleged inconsistencies with the internal statute of the Muslim religious organisation, and not breaches of the law. 16.On 2 November 1994 the supporters of Mr Gendzhev held a national conference. The conference proclaimed itself the legitimate representative of Muslim believers, elected an alternative leadership and adopted a statute. MrGendzhev was elected President of the Supreme Holy Council. After the conference the newly elected leaders applied to the Directorate of Religious Denominations for registration as the legitimate leadership of the Bulgarian Muslims. 17.On 3 January 1995 the Supreme Holy Council presided over by the first applicant decided to convene a national conference on 28 January 1995. 18.At the end of 1994, parliamentary elections took place in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian Socialist Party (БСП) obtained a majority in Parliament and formed a new government, which took office in January 1995. 19.On 16 January 1995 the Directorate of Religious Denominations wrote a letter to the first applicant in his capacity of Chief Mufti urging him to postpone the conference. The letter stated, inter alia : “As the Directorate of Religious Denominations was concerned with [the] irregularities [as regards the election of local muftis] as early as the middle of 1994, it repeatedly ... urged the rapid resolution of the problems ... Unfortunately no specific measures were undertaken ... As a result the conflicts in the religious community deepened, and discontent among Muslims increased, leading to the holding of an extraordinary national conference on 2 November 1994. This brought to light a new problem, related to the shortcomings of the statute of the Muslim religious community... [The statute] does not clarify the procedure for convening a national conference ... Issues concerning the participants, and the manner in which they are chosen ..., are not regulated. Therefore, for the executive branch of the State it becomes legally impossible to decide whether the national conference is in conformity with the statute [of the Muslim religion] and, accordingly, whether its decisions are valid. These decisions, quite understandably, could be challenged by some of the Muslims in Bulgaria. Any other national conference, except one organised by a joint committee [of the rival leaderships], would raise the same problem. Moreover, the decision of 3 January 1995 of the Supreme Holy Council to hold an extraordinary national conference on 28January 1995 is signed only by six legitimate members of the Holy Council... [and] ... cannot be regarded as being in conformity with the statute. The Directorate of Religious Denominations cannot disregard the findings of the [Chamber of the] Supreme Court in its decision of 7 [April] 1993. It is mentioned therein that the Directorate had acted ultra vires when removing Mr Gendzhev from his position of Chief Mufti and that the decision of the Directorate of 10 February 1992 could not have legal consequences. Extremely worried as regards the current situation and deeply concerned over the well-being of the Muslims in Bulgaria, the Directorate of Religious Denominations supports the opinion of the Chief Mufti [the first applicant] that it is not advisable to rush ahead with the holding of an extraordinary conference before overcoming the conflicts in the religious community ... Firmly convinced that the disputed questions in the religious community should not be decided by administrative means by the executive branch of the State ... the Directorate appeals to you to show good will and reach a consensus for the holding of a united conference ...” 20.On 27 January 1995 the Supreme Holy Council presided over by MrHasan announced that it had postponed the national conference until 6March 1995. 21.On 22 February 1995 Mr Shivarov, Deputy Prime Minister of Bulgaria, issued Decree R-12, which reads as follows: “In accordance with Decree KV-15 of 6 February 1995 of the Council of Ministers read in conjunction with section 6 of the Religious Denominations Act, I approve the statute of the Muslim religion in Bulgaria, based in Sofia.” 22.The statute of the Muslim religion in Bulgaria mentioned in the decree was apparently the one adopted at the rival national conference, organised by Mr Gendzhev and held on 2 November 1994. Decree KV-15, referred to in Decree R-12, determined that Deputy Prime Minister Shivarov should be in charge of supervising the activity of the Directorate of Religious Denominations. 23.On 23 February 1995 the Directorate of Religious Denominations of the Council of Ministers issued a decision which stated that, in accordance with sections 6, 9 and 16 of the Religious Denominations Act and DecreeR12 of the Deputy Prime Minister, it had registered a new leadership of the Bulgarian Muslim community. The leadership thus registered included Mr Gendzhev as President of the Supreme Holy Council and, apparently, those elected at the conference of 2 November 1994. 24.Neither Decree R-12 nor the decision of the Directorate of Religious Denominations gave any reasons or any explanation regarding the procedure followed. The decisions were not formally served on Mr Hasan, who learned about them from the press. 25.On 27 February 1995 the newly registered leadership of the Muslim community accompanied by private security guards entered the premises of the Chief Mufti's Office in Sofia, forcibly evicted the staff working there, and occupied the building. The applicants submit that the police, who arrived after the surprise action, immediately stepped in to protect the new occupants of the building. Following the action of 27 February 1995 the new leadership took over all documents and assets belonging to the religious organisation of Bulgarian Muslims in Sofia and, in the months which followed, in various other towns in the country. The Directorate of Religious Denominations allegedly sent letters to the banks where the Muslim religious organisation had its accounts, informing them of the change of leadership. In the following weeks several municipalities, allegedly upon the instructions of the Directorate, registered new regional muftis. Also, the staff of the Chief Mufti's Office and ten Islamic teachers, the second applicant among them, were allegedly dismissed de facto as they were prevented from continuing their work. 26.On 27 February 1995, immediately after the take-over, the first applicant submitted to the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office (Главна прокуратура) a request for assistance, stating that there had been an unlawful mob action and that the persons who had occupied the building of the Chief Mufti's Office were squatters who had to be evicted. By decisions of 8 and 28March 1995 the prosecuting authorities refused to take action. They found, inter alia, that the new occupants of the building had legal grounds to stay there as they were duly registered by the Directorate of Religious Denominations and represented the religious leadership of the Muslim community in the country. 27.On 23 March 1995, apparently in reply to a request from the first applicant, the Directorate of Religious Denominations sent him, in his capacity as a private person, a letter which stated, inter alia: “The Muslim religious community in Bulgaria ... has, in 1888, 1891, 1919, 1949, 1986, 1992 and 1995, repeatedly changed its statute as concerns its organisational structure ..., but never as regards its religious foundation. Decree R-12 of 22 February 1995 ... sanctions an [organisational] change, which the religious community itself wished to undertake ...” This letter was apparently the first document originating from the competent State bodies which implied clearly that the statute of the Muslim religious community approved by Decree R-12 had replaced the previous statute and that the new registered leadership had replaced the first applicant. 28.On 18 April 1995 the first applicant, acting on behalf of the Chief Mufti's Office which he headed, lodged an appeal against Decree R-12 with the Supreme Court. He stated that, on the face of it, Decree R-12 stipulated nothing more than the registration of a new religious organisation. However, from the decisions and the letter of the Directorate of Religious Denominations which had followed, it had become clear that what had taken place was the replacement of the statute and the leadership of an existing religious denomination. Furthermore, it transpired that the motivation behind this act had been the understanding that the Muslim religion in Bulgaria could have only one leadership and one statute. The State did not have the right to impose such a view on Muslims, multiple religious organisations of one and the same religion being normal in other countries, as in Bulgaria. Therefore the Council of Ministers had acted beyond its powers. The resulting interference in the internal disputes of the Muslim religious community was unlawful. At the oral hearing held by the Supreme Court the first applicant also stated that there had been an unlawful interference with Muslims' religious liberties, as enshrined in the Constitution. 29.The first applicant also submitted that the conference of 2November1994 had been organised by people outside the Muslim religious organisation over which he presided. Accordingly, they could register their own religious organisation but could not claim to replace the leadership of another. The second applicant asked the Supreme Court either to declare Decree R-12 null and void as being against the law, or to declare that it constituted the registration of a new religious community, the existing Muslim organisation being unaffected. 30.On 27 July 1995 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. The court stated that under the Religious Denominations Act the Council of Ministers enjoyed full discretion in its decision as to whether or not to register the statute of a given religion. The Supreme Court's jurisdiction was therefore limited to an examination of whether the impugned decision had been issued by the competent administrative organ and whether the procedural requirements had been complied with. In that respect Decree R-12 was lawful. As regards the request for interpretation of Decree R-12, it was not open to the Supreme Court, in the framework of those particular proceedings, to state its opinion as to whether it had the effect of creating a new legal person, or introducing changes, and whether after this decision there existed two parallel Muslim religious organisations. 31.The national conference of Muslims in Bulgaria organised by MrHasan took place as planned on 6 March 1995. The minutes of the conference establish that it was attended by 1,553 persons, of whom 1,188 were official delegates with voting rights. These were representatives of eleven local chapters and of the central leadership. The conference adopted some amendments of the statute of the Muslim community and elected its leadership. The first applicant was re-elected Chief Mufti. 32.On 5 June 1995 the first applicant, acting as Chief Mufti, submitted a petition to the Council of Ministers requesting the registration of the new statute and leadership of Muslims in Bulgaria, as adopted by the conference of 6 March 1995. On 6 October 1995 he repeated the request. However, there was no response from the Council of Ministers. 33.On an unspecified date the first applicant appealed to the Supreme Court against the tacit refusal of the Council of Ministers to register the decisions of the March 1995 conference. 34.On 14 October 1996 the Supreme Court delivered its judgment. It noted that in 1992 the Chief Mufti's Office as represented by Mr Hasan had been duly registered as a religious denomination under section 6 of the Religious Denominations Act and had thus obtained legal personality of which it had not been subsequently deprived. Therefore the Council of Ministers was under an obligation, pursuant to sections 6 and 16 of the Act, to examine a request for registration of a new statute or of changes in the leadership in the existing religious denomination. Accordingly, the Supreme Court ruled that the tacit refusal of the Council of Ministers had been unlawful and ordered the transmission of the file to the Council of Ministers, which was required to examine it. 35.On 19 November 1996 Deputy Prime Minister Shivarov refused to register the 1995 statute and leadership of the Chief Mufti's Office as represented by Mr Hasan. He sent him a letter stating, inter alia, that the Council of Ministers had already registered a leadership of the Muslim community in Bulgaria, which was that elected by the November 1994 conference with Mr Gendzhev as President of the Supreme Holy Council. The Deputy Prime Minister concluded that the first applicant's request “[could not] be granted as it [was] clearly contrary to the provisions of the Religious Denominations Act”. 36.On 5 December 1996 the first applicant, acting as Chief Mufti, appealed to the Supreme Court against the refusal of the Deputy Prime Minister. 37.On 13 March 1997 the Supreme Court quashed that refusal on the ground that it was unlawful and contrary to Article 13 of the Constitution. The refusal constituted “an unlawful administrative intervention into the internal organisation of [a] religious community”. The Supreme Court again ordered the transmission of the file to the Council of Ministers for registration. 38.Despite these Supreme Court judgments the Council of Ministers did not grant registration to the religious leadership headed by Mr Hasan. 39.In February 1997 the government of the Bulgarian Socialist Party stepped down and an interim cabinet was appointed. At the general elections which followed in April 1997 the Union of Democratic Forces obtained a majority in Parliament and formed a new government. 40.On 24 March 1997 the first applicant again requested the Council of Ministers to register the 1995 statute and leadership. There followed informal contacts between the Muslim leadership of Mr Hasan and representatives of the government. The applicants were allegedly told that the government would only agree to register a new leadership of the Muslims if it was elected at a unification conference. 41.The Directorate of Religious Denominations urged the two rival leaderships of Mr Hasan and of Mr Gendzhev to negotiate a solution. On 12September 1997 the leadership headed by Mr Hasan decided to accept the holding of a unification conference under certain conditions. A five-member contact group was appointed to hold negotiations. On 30 September 1997 representatives of the two rival leaderships signed an agreement to convene a national conference of all Muslim believers on 23 October 1997. The agreement, which was also signed by Deputy Prime Minister Metodiev and the Director of Religious Denominations, provided, inter alia, that the parties would not obstruct the unification process, failing which the Directorate would take appropriate administrative measures. In addition, the leadership of MrGendzhev undertook not to dispose of any Muslim property or assets before the conference. 42.The Directorate of Religious Denominations took an active part in organising the national conference. The mayors in many localities distributed to the local chapters forms bearing the seal of the Directorate. These forms were filled out at the meetings of the local chapters which elected delegates to the national conference and were certified by the mayors' signatures. 43.On 23 October 1997, 1,384 delegates attended the conference. Only delegates whose election had been certified by the mayors were allowed to participate. The conference adopted a new statute of the Muslim denomination in Bulgaria and elected a new leadership comprising members of the leadership of Mr Hasan and others. Mr Hasan apparently attended the conference and approved of the new leadership. Six leaders of the group led by him were elected to the new Supreme Holy Council. Mr Hasan was not among them. On 28 October 1997 the government registered the newly elected leadership. 44.Although the religious community which accepted Mr Gendzhev's authority was involved in the unification process, Mr Gendzhev himself and some of his supporters did not sign the agreement of 30 September 1997 and did not attend the conference, considering that it was manipulated by the State. The conference voted a resolution authorising the new leadership to conduct an audit and seek the prosecution of Mr Gendzhev for alleged unlawful transactions. 45.Mr Gendzhev, who claimed that he remained the Chief Mufti, appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Върховен административен съд) against the government's decision to register the new leadership. By a judgment of 16 July 1998 the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the appeal as being inadmissible. It found that the Chief Mufti's Office of MrGendzhev had no locus standi to lodge an appeal as it had never been validly registered. Decree R-12 of 22 February 1995 had been signed by Deputy Prime Minister Shivarov, who had not been duly authorised by the Council of Ministers. Decree KV-15 did not contain an express authorisation for the Deputy Prime Minister to approve the statutes of religious denominations. As a result the Chief Mufti's Office of Mr Gendzhev had never legally existed and all its acts between 1995 and 1997 were null and void. 46.The relevant provisions of the 1991 Constitution read as follows: Article 13 “(1)Religions shall be free. (2)Religious institutions shall be separate from the State. (3)Eastern Orthodox Christianity shall be considered the traditional religion in the Republic of Bulgaria. (4)Religious institutions and communities, and religious beliefs shall not be used for political ends.” Article 37 “(1)The freedom of conscience, the freedom of thought and the choice of religion or of religious or atheistic views shall be inviolable. The State shall assist in the maintenance of tolerance and respect between the adherents of different denominations, and between believers and non-believers. (2)The freedom of conscience and religion shall not be exercised to the detriment of national security, public order, public health and morals, or of the rights and freedoms of others.” 47.The Constitutional Court's judgment no. 5 of 11 June 1992 provides a legally binding interpretation of the above provisions. It states, inter alia, that the State must not interfere with the internal organisation of religious communities and institutions, which must be regulated by their own statutes and rules. The State may interfere with the activity of a religious community or institution only in the cases contemplated in Articles 13 § 4 and 37 § 2 of the Constitution. An assessment as to whether there is such a case may also be undertaken at the time of registration of a religious community or institution. 48.The Religious Denominations Act came into force in 1949 and has been amended several times since then. The relevant provisions of the Act, as in force at the time of the events at issue, read as follows. Section 6 “(1)A religious denomination shall be considered recognised and shall become a legal person upon the approval of its statute by the Council of Ministers, or by a Deputy Prime Minister authorised for this purpose. (2)The Council of Ministers, or a Deputy Prime Minister authorised for this purpose, shall revoke the recognition, by a reasoned decision, if the activities of the religious denomination breach the law, public order or morals.” Section 9 “(1)Every religious denomination shall have a leadership accountable to the State. (2)The statute of the religious denomination shall establish its governing and representative bodies and the procedure for their election and appointment ...” Section 16 “(1)The national governing bodies of the religious denominations shall register with the Directorate of Religious Denominations of the Council of Ministers, and local governing bodies with the local municipalities, and they shall submit a list of the names of all members of these governing bodies.” 49.The Act also lays down rules regarding the activities of a religious denomination, imposes requirements as regards its clergy and gives the Directorate of Religious Denominations certain supervisory functions. In its judgment no. 5 of 11 June 1992 the Constitutional Court, while agreeing that certain provisions of the Religious Denominations Act were clearly unconstitutional, found that it was not its task to repeal legal provisions adopted prior to the entry into force of the 1991 Constitution, the ordinary courts being competent to declare them inapplicable. 50.The applicants contended that as a consequence of the provisions of section 6 of the Act, and since there is no public register for recognised religious denominations, in practice a religious community can establish its existence as a legal entity only by producing a copy of a letter or a decision to that effect issued by the Directorate of Religious Denominations. The same applies to the leader of a religious denomination when he needs to provide accreditation. 51.Under Decree no. 125 of the Council of Ministers of 6December1990, as amended, the competence of the Directorate of Religious Denominations includes “contacts between the State and religions denominations”, assistance to central and local administrative authorities in solving problems which involve religious matters and assistance to religious organisations as regards education and publications. 52.There are no procedural provisions under Bulgarian law specifically applicable to the examination by the Council of Ministers, or by a deputy prime minister, of a petition for authorisation of a religious denomination. Section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act (Закон за административното производство), which contains a general legal regime on the procedure for the issuing of and appeal against administrative decisions, provides that the Act is not applicable as regards decisions of the Council of Ministers.",2000,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

142,001-58913,Grand Chamber,"7.The applicant, David Hood, is a British national born in 1970. He resides in the United Kingdom. At the relevant time, he was a soldier with the regular forces of the British army.>Prior to the events in question, the applicant went absent without leave from his unit in Germany three times. Prior to his third absence, he had been remanded for trial by court martial on an assault charge (later abandoned), he remained absent for almost two and a half years and he gave himself up to the civilian police in December 1993.>On 11May1994 the applicant did not return after two weeks’ leave (his fourth absence without leave). On 27 November 1994 he was arrested at his home by the civilian police and on 28November1994 he was taken by army escort to Brompton Barracks. Before the Court, the parties disputed whether the applicant was then brought before his commanding officer on 29 November 1994 pursuant to Rule 4 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 (see paragraph 29 below). 10.The applicant remained in close arrest until his court martial. He was detained in a cell in a guardroom under the supervision of a guard apart from certain occasions when he was taken to hospital for psychiatric care. 11.In or about December 1994 the applicant was informed that he would have to appear before the unit adjutant after Christmas. He retained a solicitor prior to Christmas, who advised him until 17 January 1995. On 4January1995 the applicant appeared before the unit adjutant and was given the abstract of evidence. He was told that he should read the abstract and check that it was accurate. The applicant was cautioned pursuant to Rule 10 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 (see paragraph 32 below). 12.Acting on his original solicitor’s advice, the applicant prepared his own statement and obtained a statement from his girlfriend, which statements were completed on 4 and 19 January 1995 respectively. The applicant submitted both statements to the adjutant on 20 January 1995, which statements were then attached to the abstract of evidence. The applicant was then remanded for trial by court martial by his commanding officer and he applied for legal aid from the military authorities. The charge sheet, dated 25January1995 and signed by his commanding officer and on behalf of the convening officer, recorded two charges of absence without leave and two of desertion contrary to the Army Act 1955. 13.Although the applicant instructed his present solicitor in early February, the latter did not commence work for the applicant until legal aid was granted by the Ministry of Defence by letter dated 14 February 1995. 14.By notice dated 17March1995 a district court martial was convened to try the applicant on the charges. The court martial took place on 3and4April1995. The assistant prosecuting officer was the unit adjutant. The applicant, who was legally represented, pleaded not guilty. 15.During the court-martial hearing, the applicant’s solicitor challenged (under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984) the admission into evidence of the statements of the applicant and his girlfriend. The judge advocate (having heard evidence from the unit adjutant and the applicant’s representative) found that Rule 10 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 had been followed. Given the applicant’s legal representation at the relevant time and the procedures followed, the judge advocate could not see “how a fairer situation could have arisen” and, accordingly, he rejected the applicant’s challenge. The judge advocate also clarified during the court martial that “we can take it as an agreed fact that the adjutant or the assistant adjutant will either be the prosecuting or assistant prosecuting officer in any court martial”. The applicant was convicted on the two charges of absence without leave and on one of the charges of desertion, and the remaining charge of desertion was reduced to one of “absent without leave”. He was sentenced to be imprisoned for eight months and to be dismissed from the service, the sentence expressly taking account of the period of close arrest immediately preceding the court martial. 16.After confirmation and promulgation of the conviction and sentence, the applicant petitioned the Army. By letter dated 13July1995 the applicant was informed that his petition to the Army Board had been rejected. His leave application to the single judge of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court was rejected on 13 September 1995 and his further appeal to the full Courts-Martial Appeal Court was also refused on 18March1996. 17.The seventy-second day of the applicant’s detention fell on or around 7February 1995. Accordingly, and pursuant to Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 and paragraph 6.045(c) of the Queen’s Regulations (see paragraphs 31 and 38 below), a direction from the convening officer was completed on 3 February 1995 attaching an authorisation from the Commander in Chief, the latter of whom directed the applicant’s continued detention “to prevent him absconding” before trial (“the delay report”). 18.Having requested a copy of the delay report and informed the authorities of his intention to apply for a writ of habeas corpus, the applicant’s solicitor issued those proceedings on 17February1995 challenging mainly the regularity of the delay report. That report was received by the applicant’s solicitor on 20February1995, following which further submissions were made to the High Court. 19.On 21 February 1995 the High Court rejected the application. The court found, inter alia, that the delay report had been properly completed in a timely fashion. It noted that the expressed reason for the applicant’s continued detention was to prevent his absconding and found that “perfectly understandable” given the charges against him. 20.At the relevant time the provisions governing the detention and trial of members of the army were contained in the Army Act 1955 (“the 1955 Act”), in the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 (“the 1972 Rules”) and in the Queen’s Regulations for the Army 1975 (“the Queen’s Regulations”). 21.Since the applicant’s court martial, the law has been amended by, inter alia, the Armed Forces Act 1996 (see the Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, p. 276, §§ 52-57) and by the Investigation and Summary Dealing (Army) Regulations 1997 (“the 1997 Regulations”). The provisions detailed below are those applicable at the time of the applicant’s arrest, detention and court martial. 22.A warrant for the arrest of a person subject to military law and considered to have deserted or to be absent without leave may be issued by the commanding officer and any such warrant must be addressed to the civilian police. A person arrested pursuant to that warrant must be handed over as soon as is practicable to the military (section 190A of the 1955 Act). 23.The relevant rules vary depending on whether the accused is a non-commissioned officer or soldier or, on the other hand, an officer or warrant officer. In the former case (described below), the commanding officer’s powers are generally broader as regards the investigation and pursuit of charges against an accused. 24.Desertion and absence without leave constitute offences under the 1955 Act. The punishment for the offence of desertion is imprisonment for an unlimited term (subject to the sentencing power of the court martial in question) and that for absence without leave is imprisonment for a maximum of two years. 25.Section 75 of the 1955 Act provides that the allegations against a person subject to military law who is under arrest shall be duly investigated without unnecessary delay and that as soon as may be, either proceedings shall be taken for punishing the offence or he shall be released from arrest. In addition, should that detention last longer than eight days without a court martial being convened, a report (a “delay report”) on the necessity for further delay shall be made by the person’s commanding officer to the prescribed authority in the prescribed manner and a similar report shall be made to the same authority and in the same manner every eight days until a court martial is assembled or the offence is dealt with summarily or the accused is released from detention. 26.Any allegation that the person subject to military law has committed an offence under the 1955 Act must be reported in the form of a charge to that person’s commanding officer and, before any action is taken, the commanding officer must investigate the charge (section 76). 27.After investigation, a charge (which cannot be dealt with summarily) may be dismissed by a commanding officer if he is of the opinion that it ought not to be proceeded with. Moreover, if it appears to the commanding officer that proceedings in respect of the matters to which the charge relates could be, and in the interests of the better administration of justice ought to be, taken against the accused otherwise than under the 1955 Act, the commanding officer may stay further proceedings (sections 77 and 77A). 28.If the commanding officer has not stayed the charge and if the charge is not one which can be dealt with summarily and it has not been dismissed or if it is a charge which can be dealt with summarily but the commanding officer is of the opinion that it should not be so dealt with, he shall take the “prescribed steps” with a view to the charge being tried by court martial (section 78(1) and (2)). Dealing summarily with a charge includes taking evidence, reducing it to writing, deciding as to the guilt or innocence of the accused and rendering sentence (section 78(3)). However, where the commanding officer has taken steps to have the charge tried by court martial, any higher authority to whom the case is forwarded may refer the charge back to the commanding officer to be tried summarily if the charge is one that can be dealt with summarily (section 78(6)) or with a direction to dismiss the charge or to stay all further proceedings therein. 29.Rule 4 of the 1972 Rules provides that when a person is detained by a military authority, his commanding officer shall, unless it is impracticable, within forty-eight hours of becoming aware that he is so detained have such person brought before him, inform him of the charge against him and begin to investigate it. If the investigation has not begun within the forty-eight hours, the commanding officer must report the case to a higher authority together with the reasons for the delay in commencing the investigation (Rule 4(2)). 30.The report to which section 75 of the 1955 Act refers shall be signed by the commanding officer of the person detained and shall be sent to the person who would be responsible for convening the court martial (Rule 5). According to Schedule 1 to the 1972 Rules the report must, inter alia, specify whether the accused is in close or open arrest, the reasons for his detention, certain details about the progress of the investigations and of the preparation for trial together with the reasons for the delay since the last report. 31.The accused shall not be held in arrest for more than seventy-two consecutive days without a court martial having been convened unless the convening officer directs in writing, citing reasons, that the accused shall not be released from detention (Rule 6). 32.Rule 10(1) provides that an abstract of evidence shall be made by the commanding officer or by another officer on the direction of the commanding officer. The accused shall not be present while the abstract of evidence is being made and it shall consist of a signed statement by, or a précis of the evidence of, each witness whose evidence is necessary to prove the charge. Once compiled, the accused is given (normally by the officer who compiled the abstract) a copy and the accused is cautioned as follows: “This is a copy of the abstract of evidence in your case; you are not obliged to say anything with regard to it unless you wish to do so, but you should read it and, when you have read it, if you wish to say anything, what you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.” (Rule 10(2) of the 1972 Rules) 33.Statements submitted by the accused (including those of witnesses which he wishes to be included in the abstract) shall be attached to the abstract of evidence and shall thereafter form part of it (Rule 10(4)). The pamphlet entitled “Rights of a Soldier” (which is given to accused persons and which is available in the cells in the guardroom) describes the purpose of the extract of evidence as, inter alia, to “provide a brief for the prosecutor at trial” and to inform the accused of the evidence which will be given at trial. 34.The prescribed steps to be taken by a commanding officer for sending a case for trial by court martial include, in accordance with Rule 13, sending to higher authority a draft charge sheet (signed by the commanding officer), the abstract of evidence, a statement of character together with the service record of the accused and a recommendation as to how the charge should be proceeded with (for example, by district or general court martial). It is the convening officer who finally decides on the charges to be retained against an accused and he generally does so by countersigning the draft charge sheet submitted by the commanding officer. 35.Paragraph 6.005 of the Queen's Regulations states that the mere allegation that a person subject to military law has committed an offence does not, of itself, necessarily warrant placing that person under arrest of any description. If the offence is trivial, the offender is to be informed of the charge and required to report to the unit orderly room at a specific date and time. If arrest is necessary, the category of arrest is to be determined in the interests of the service and by the nature of the alleged offence. Generally, a person is to be placed under close arrest only when confinement is necessary to ensure his safe custody or to maintain discipline. 36.The circumstances which would warrant placing an accused under close arrest include those where the accused is deliberately trying to undermine discipline, is likely to injure himself or others or is likely to suborn witnesses; where he has not surrendered but has been apprehended as an illegal absentee or has habitually absented himself; and where, having regard to the nature or prevalence of the alleged offence which is under investigation, it is undesirable in the interests of discipline that he should be at large or allowed to consort with his comrades (also paragraph 6.005). 37.Paragraph 6.007 provides that (subject to, inter alia, the general principle that the accused is not to be unnecessarily held under arrest) commanding officers are responsible for ensuring that in each case the need to keep an accused under arrest, together with the form of that arrest, is kept under constant review. As necessary, the form of arrest may be changed or the accused released. 38.Paragraph 6.045(c) provides that the person into whose custody the accused is committed is to inform the accused of the rank, name and unit of the person by whom he is alleged to have committed the offence and the nature of the allegation. Paragraph 6.047 provides that a charge preferred against an officer or soldier is to be dealt with at the earliest opportunity. Accordingly, it is provided, inter alia, that on the receipt of every delay report the convening officer is to satisfy himself (if the accused is in detention) as to the necessity of the ongoing detention (subsections (a) and (b)). On receipt of the fourth delay report, or, in any event, after forty days’ detention, the convening officer is to make a special report to his/her superior officer outlining the reasons for the delay, when it is expected the accused will be brought to trial and the reasons for the continued detention (subsection (c)). If an accused is not brought to trial by the seventy-second day, the latter superior officer must, in turn, make a special report to the Commander in Chief by that day (subsection (d)). On receipt of such special reports, the superior officer and Commander in Chief mentioned are to take all practical steps to expedite the trial of the accused (subsection (e)). 39.Where an accused has been in detention for seventy-two consecutive days without a court martial being convened, a direction in accordance with Rule 6 of the 1972 Rules not to release the accused can only be given with the prior approval of the Commander in Chief. This report is to contain the reasons for the delay, when it is expected the accused will be brought to trial and the reasons for the continued detention (paragraph 6.047(f)). Delay reports are not, as a rule, copied to the accused or his representative. 40.Habeas corpus is a procedure whereby a detained person may make an urgent application for release from custody on the basis that his detention is unlawful. Jurisdiction is normally exercised by the Divisional Court of the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court and habeas corpus is available to persons in military custody (R. v. Royal Army Service Corp. Colchester, ex parte Elliott [1949] 1 All England Law Reports at p. 373). 41.The scope of this review will depend on the context of the particular case and, where appropriate, the terms of the relevant statute under which the power of detention is exercised. However, the court will examine the legal validity of an accused’s detention and whether there is sufficient evidence to detain him, and, if the power to detain depends on the prior establishment of an objective fact, the court will decide whether that fact exists (Khawaja v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [1984] Appeal Cases at p. 74). 42.Legal aid is not available from the military authorities for applications to the civilian courts, including applications for writs of habeas corpus. However, legal aid from the civilian authorities is available for such proceedings. A person will not be granted representation for the purposes of any such proceedings unless it is considered that there are reasonable grounds for taking, defending or being a party to proceedings (section 15(2) of the Legal Aid Act 1988). Such an application for legal aid will only be approved after all the questions of fact or law arising in the action, cause or matter to which the application relates, and all the circumstances in which the application was made, have been considered (Civil Legal Aid (General) Regulations 1989). 43.An application for an emergency legal aid certificate can be made pursuant to the Civil Legal Aid (General) Regulations 1989. The information furnished must be such as to allow the area director to decide the nature of the relevant proceedings, the circumstances in which it is required, whether the application is likely to fulfil the conditions under which legal aid may be granted and whether it is in the interests of justice that the applicant should as a matter of urgency be granted legal aid. 44.The relevant provisions of the 1955 Act relating to general courts martial are set out in the above-mentioned Findlay judgment (at pp. 272-75, §§ 32-51). These provisions (summarised at paragraph 45 below) apply equally to a district court martial with certain relevant differences. A district court martial comprises a president and a minimum of two other officers and the minimum rank of those members is lower than for a general court martial. 45.Central to the court-martial system under the 1955 Act was the role of the “convening officer”. This officer (who had to be of a specified rank and in command of a body of the regular forces or of the command within which the person to be tried was serving) assumed responsibility for every case to be tried by court martial. That officer had the final decision on the nature and detail of the charges to be brought and the type of court martial required, and was responsible for convening the court martial. The convening officer would draw up a convening order, which would specify, inter alia, the date, place and time of the trial, the name of the president and the details of the other members, all of whom he could appoint. Failing the appointment of a judge advocate by the Judge Advocate General’s Office, the convening officer could appoint one. He also appointed, or directed a commanding officer to appoint, the prosecuting officer. Prior to the hearing, the convening officer was responsible for sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and to the judge advocate, and could indicate the passages which might be inadmissible. He procured the attendance at trial of all witnesses to be called for the prosecution. When charges were withdrawn, the convening officer’s consent was normally obtained, although it was not necessary in all cases, and a plea to a lesser charge could not be accepted from the accused without it. He had also to ensure that the accused had a proper opportunity to prepare his defence, legal representation if required and the opportunity to contact the defence witnesses, and was responsible for ordering the attendance at the hearing of all witnesses “reasonably requested” by the defence. The convening officer could dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial, when required in the interests of the administration of justice. In addition, he could comment on the proceedings of a court martial. Those remarks would not form part of the record of the proceedings and would normally be communicated in a separate minute to the members of the court, although in an exceptional case, where a more public instruction was required in the interests of discipline, they could be made known in the orders of the command. The convening officer usually acted as confirming officer also. The findings of a court martial were not effective until confirmed by the confirming officer, who was empowered to withhold confirmation or substitute, postpone or remit in whole or in part any sentence.",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

114,001-91704,Grand Chamber,"8.The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in .>From 1997 to 1999 the applicant was chairman of the board of the Krasnoyarsk Aluminium Plant. At the time of his arrest in October 2000 he was a major shareholder and an executive of a corporation called OAO Krasenergomash-Holding and a founder of a number of affiliated firms. He was also a deputy of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Parliamentary Assembly. 10.In September 2000 the applicant allegedly ordered V., a member of his entourage, to kill S., the applicant's former business associate. V. did not comply with the order, but on 18 September 2000 he reported the applicant to the Federal Security Service of the (“the FSB”). On the following day V. handed in the gun which he had allegedly received from the applicant. 11.On 21 September 2000 the Prosecutor of the Severo-Zapadnyy District of Moscow opened a criminal investigation in respect of the applicant on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. 12.On 26 and 27 September 2000 the FSB and the police decided to conduct a covert operation to obtain evidence of the applicant's intention to murder S. 13.On 29 September 2000 the police staged the discovery of two dead men at S.'s home. They officially announced in the media that one of those killed had been identified as S. The other man was his business partner, 14.On 3 October 2000 V., acting on the police's instructions, came to see the applicant at his estate. He carried a hidden radio-transmitting device while a police officer outside received and recorded the transmission. He was received by the applicant in a “guest house”, a part of the estate connected to his personal residence. In accordance with the instructions, V. engaged the applicant in conversation by telling him that he had carried out the assassination. As proof of his accomplishment he handed the applicant several objects taken from S. and : a certified copy of a mining project feasibility study marked with a special chemical agent, two watches belonging to S. and and 20,000 dollars (USD) in cash. At the end of the conversation V. took the cash, as suggested by the applicant. The police obtained a sixteen-minute recording of the dialogue between V. and the applicant. 15.On 4 October 2000 the applicant's estate was searched. Several watches were seized, including those belonging to S. and A chemical analysis was conducted and revealed the presence on the applicant's hands of the chemical agent which had been used to mark the feasibility study. The applicant was arrested. 16.On 27 February 2001 the applicant complained to the Prosecutor of the Severo-Zapadnyy District of Moscow that his prosecution had been unlawful because it involved numerous procedural violations of his rights, including the unauthorised intrusion into his home and the use of the radio-transmitting device. On 2 March 2001 the prosecutor dismissed his complaint, having found, in particular, that the applicant had let V. into his house voluntarily and that therefore there had been no intrusion. It was also found that no judicial authorisation had been required for the use of the radio-transmitting device because in accordance with the Operational-Search Activities Act, it was only required for the interception of communications transmitted by means of wire channels or mail services, none of which had been employed in the covert operation at issue. 17.Following the applicant's arrest on 4 October 2000, on 6October 2000 the Deputy Prosecutor of the Severo-Zapadnyy District of Moscow ordered his detention during the investigation, having found that it was “in accordance with the law” and necessary in view of the gravity of the charge and the risk that the applicant might influence witnesses. Further extensions were ordered by the competent prosecutor on 17 November 2000 (until 21December 2000) and on 15 December 2000 (until 21 March 2001). The reasons for the applicant's continued detention were the gravity of the charge and the risk of his influencing the witnesses and obstructing the investigation. The applicant appealed against each of these decisions to a court. 18.On 26 January 2001 the Lefortovskiy District Court of Moscow examined the applicant's appeal against his continued detention on remand and confirmed the lawfulness of his detention. The court referred to the gravity of the charge and noted that this measure had been applied in accordance with the law. The applicant lodged a further appeal, which was also dismissed by the Moscow City Court. 19.In view of the forthcoming expiry of the term of the applicant's detention, its further extension was ordered by the competent prosecutor, first on 15 March 2001, until 4 April 2001, and then on 21 March 2001, until 4 June 2001, still on the grounds of the gravity of the charge and the risk of his influencing the witnesses and obstructing the investigation. The applicant challenged the extensions before the court. 20.On 11 April 2001 the Lefortovskiy District Court of Moscow declared that the applicant's detention until 4 June 2001 was lawful and necessary on account of the gravity of the charge. The applicant lodged an appeal with the Moscow City Court, which was dismissed on 15 May 2001. The appeal court considered the applicant's detention lawful and necessary “until the bill of indictment had been submitted or until the applicant's immunity had been confirmed”. 21.On 22 May 2001 the Deputy Prosecutor General extended the applicant's detention on remand until 4 September 2001, still on the grounds of the gravity of the charge and the risk of his influencing the witnesses and obstructing the investigation. 22.On 27 August 2001 the case was referred to the Tushinskiy District Court of Moscow. On 7 September 2001 the court scheduled the hearing for 26September 2001 and authorised the applicant's further detention without indicating any reasons or the length of the extension. On 3 October 2001 the Moscow City Court examined and dismissed an appeal by the applicant, upholding his continued detention without elaborating on the reasons. 23.On 21 December 2001 the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow scheduled the hearing for 4 January 2002 and authorised the applicant's further detention, citing no reasons. The court did not indicate the length of the prospective detention. It again reviewed the lawfulness of the applicant's detention on 4 January 2002 but found that it was still necessary owing to the gravity of the charges and the “circumstances of the case”. An appeal by the applicant to the Moscow City Court was dismissed on 15January 2002. 24.Further applications by the applicant for release were examined on 23January, 6 March, 11 March and 23 April 2002. As before, the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow refused his release, citing the gravity of the charge and the risk of his evading trial and influencing the witnesses. The applicant was released on 19 June 2002 following his conviction (see paragraph 45 below). 25.On 3 October 2000, immediately after visiting the applicant in the “guest house”, V. was questioned by the investigators. He reported on the contents of his conversation with the applicant and submitted that he had handed him the gun, the watches and the feasibility study. He was subsequently questioned on 12 October, 9 November, 8 December and 18December 2000. 26.The applicant was questioned as a suspect for the first time on 4October 2000. From October to December 2000 he was questioned at least seven times. 27.On 10 October 2000 the applicant and V. were questioned in a confrontation with each other. The applicant's legal counsel were present at the confrontation. The statements made by the applicant on that occasion were subsequently summarised in the indictment, of which the relevant part reads as follows: “At the confrontation between A.P. Bykov and [V.] on 10 October 2000 Bykov altered, in part, certain substantive details of his previous statements, as follows. [He] claims that he has been acquainted with [V.] for a long time, about 7 years; they have normal relations; the last time he saw him was on 3 October 2000, and before that they had been in contact about two years previously. He has never given any orders or instructions to [V.], including any concerning [S.]. When [V.] came to see him on 3October 2000 he began to tell him off for coming to him. When he asked [V.] who had told him to kill [S.] he replied that nobody had, he had just wanted to prove to himself that he could do it. He began to comfort [V.], saying that he could help with his father; [he] did not suggest that [V.] flee the town [or] the country, and did not promise to help him financially. He did not instruct [V.] on what to do if [V.] was arrested; he asked him what was going to happen if he was arrested; [V.] said that he would tell how it all happened and would confess to having committed the crime, [and the applicant] approved of that. Concerning K., Bykov stated that this was his partner who lived and worked in Switzerland; he admitted de facto that he had spoken to him on the phone at the beginning of August ... but had given him no directions about [V.]” 28.On 13 October 2000 the applicant was charged with conspiracy to murder. Subsequently the charges were extended to include conspiracy to acquire, possess and handle firearms. 29.On 8 December 2000 two appointed linguistic experts examined the recording of the applicant's conversation with V. of 3 October 2000 and answered the following questions put to them: “1.Is it possible to establish, on the basis of the text of the conversation submitted for examination, the nature of relations between Bykov and [V.], the extent of their closeness, sympathy for each other, subordination; how is it expressed?>Was Bykov's verbal reaction to [V.]'s statement about the 'murder' of [S.] natural assuming he had ordered the murder of [S.]?>Are there any verbal signs indicating that Bykov expressed mistrust about [V.]'s information?>Is it possible to assess Bykov's verbal style as unequivocally aiming at closing the topic, ending the conversation?>Are there any identifiable stylistic, verbal signs of fear (caution) on Bykov's part in relation to [V.]?”>Are there any identifiable stylistic, verbal signs of fear (caution) on Bykov's part in relation to [V.]?” 30.In respect of the above questions the experts found: –on question 1, that the applicant and V. had known each other for a long time and had rather close and generally sympathetic relations; that V. had shown subordination to the applicant; that the applicant had played an instructive role in the conversation; –on question 2, that the applicant's reaction to V.'s information about the accomplished murder was natural and that he had insistently questioned V. on the technical details of its execution; –on question 3, that the applicant had shown no sign of mistrusting V.'s confession to the murder; –on question 4, that the applicant had not shown any clear signs of wishing to end or to avoid the conversation; –on question 5, that the applicant had not shown any fear of V.; on the contrary, V. appeared to be afraid of the applicant. 31.On 11 January 2001 the investigation was completed and the applicant was allowed access to the case file. 32.On 27 August 2001 the case was referred to the Tushinskiy District Court of Moscow. 33.On 22 October 2001 the Tushinskiy District Court declined jurisdiction in favour of the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow, having established that the venue of the attempted murder lay within that court's territorial jurisdiction. 34.On 16 December 2001 V. made a written statement certified by the Russian consulate in the repudiating his statements against the applicant. He submitted that he had made those statements under pressure from S. Two deputies of the State Duma, D. and Y.S., were present at the consulate to witness the repudiation. On the same day they recorded an interview with V. in which he explained that S. had persuaded him to make false statements against the applicant. 35.On 4 February 2002 the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow began examining the charges against the applicant. The applicant pleaded not guilty. At the trial he challenged the admissibility of the recording of his conversation with V. and of all other evidence obtained through the covert operation. He alleged that the police interference had been unlawful and that he had been induced into self-incrimination. Furthermore, he claimed that the recording had involved unauthorised intrusion into his home. He contested the interpretation of the recording by the experts and alleged that nothing in his dialogue with V. disclosed prior knowledge of a murder conspiracy. 36.During the trial the court dismissed the applicant's objection to the covert operation and admitted as lawfully obtained evidence the recording with its transcript, the linguistic expert report, V.'s statements, and the evidence showing that the applicant had accepted the feasibility study and the watches from V. It dismissed the argument that there had been an unauthorised intrusion into the applicant's premises, having found, firstly, that the applicant had expressed no objection to V.'s visit and, secondly, that their meeting had taken place in the “guest house”, which was intended for business meetings and therefore did not encroach on the applicant's privacy. The court refused to admit as evidence the official records of the search at the applicant's estate because the officers who had conducted the search on 4 October 2000 had not been covered by the authorisation. 37.The following persons were examined in the oral proceedings before the court: S. explained his relations with the applicant and their conflict of interests in the aluminium industry. He confirmed that he had participated in the covert operation; he also confirmed that in 2001 V. had told him that he had been paid off to withdraw his statements against the applicant. Twenty-five witnesses answered questions concerning the business links of the applicant, V. and S. with the aluminium plant and other businesses in Krasnoyarsk; the relations and connections between them; the existence of the conflict of interests between the applicant and S.; the events of 3October 2000, namely the arrival of V. at the “guest house”, his conversation with the applicant and the handing of the documents and the watches to the applicant; and the circumstances surrounding V.'s attempted withdrawal of his statements against the applicant. Seven experts were examined: a technical expert gave explanations about the recording of data received by way of a radio-transmitting device; a sound expert explained how a transcript of the recording of the applicant's conversation with V. had been produced; two expert linguists submitted that they had used both the tape and the recording transcript in their examination; an expert psychologist answered questions concerning his findings (evidence subsequently excluded as obtained unlawfully – see paragraph 43 below); and two corroborative experts upheld the conclusions of the expert linguists and the sound experts. Seven attesting witnesses answered questions concerning their participation in various investigative measures: the receipt of the gun handed in by V., the copying of the video and audio tapes, the treatment of the material exhibits with a chemical agent, the “discovery of the corpses” in the operative experiment, and the house search. Four investigation officers were examined: an FSB officer submitted that on 18 September 2000 V. had written a statement in his presence that the applicant had ordered him to kill S., and had handed in the gun; he also explained how the operative experiment had been carried out; two officers of the prosecutor's office and one officer of the Interior Ministry also described the operative experiment and explained how the copies of the recording of the applicant's conversation with V. had been made. 38.On 15 May 2002 during the court hearing the prosecutor requested to read out the records of the questioning of five witnesses not present at the hearing. The statements made by V. during the pre-trial investigation were among them. 39.The applicant's counsel said that he had no objections. The court decided to grant the request, having noted that “the court took exhaustive measures to call these witnesses to the court hearing and found that ... V.'s whereabouts could not be established and he could not be called to the courtroom even though a number of operational search measures were taken by the FSB and an enquiry was made to the National Central Bureau of Interpol by the Ministry of the Interior ...”. These statements were admitted as evidence. 40.The court also examined evidence relating to V.'s attempted withdrawal of his statements against the applicant. It established that during the investigation V. had already complained that pressure had been exerted on him to repudiate his statements against the applicant. It also established that the witness D., who was present at the consulate when V. had repudiated his statements, was a close friend of the applicant. The other witness, Y.S., had arrived at the consulate late and did not see the document before it was certified. 41.It was also noted that both the applicant and V. had undergone a psychiatric examination during the investigation and both had been found fit to participate in the criminal proceedings. 42.Other evidence examined by the court included: expert reports produced by chemical, ballistics, linguistic, sound and technical experts; written reports on the operative experiment; V.'s written statement of 18September 2000; a certified description of the gun handed in by V.; and records of the applicant's confrontation with V. on 20 October 2000. 42.Other evidence examined by the court included: expert reports produced by chemical, ballistics, linguistic, sound and technical experts; written reports on the operative experiment; V.'s written statement of 18September 2000; a certified description of the gun handed in by V.; and records of the applicant's confrontation with V. on 20 October 2000. 43.The applicant challenged a number of items of evidence, claiming that they had been obtained unlawfully. The court excluded some of them, in particular the expert report by a psychologist who had examined the recording of the applicant's conversation with V. and the police report on the search carried out on 4 October 2000. The attempt to challenge the audio tape containing the recording of the applicant's conversation with V., and the copies of the tape, was not successful and they were admitted as lawfully obtained evidence. 44.On 19 June 2002 the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow gave judgment, finding the applicant guilty of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to acquire, possess and handle firearms. The finding of guilt was based on the following evidence: the initial statement by V. that the applicant had ordered him to kill S.; the gun V. had handed in; the statements V. had made in front of the applicant when they had been confronted during the questioning on 10 October 2000; numerous witness statements confirming the existence of a conflict between the applicant and S.; and the physical evidence obtained through the covert operation, namely the watches and the feasibility study. Although the recording of the applicant's conversation with V. was played at the hearing, its contents did not feature among the evidence or as part of the court's reasoning. In so far as the record was mentioned in the judgment, the court relied solely on the conclusions of the linguistic experts (see paragraph 30 above) and on several reports confirming that the tape had not been tampered with. 44.On 19 June 2002 the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow gave judgment, finding the applicant guilty of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to acquire, possess and handle firearms.

In so far as the record was mentioned in the judgment, the court relied solely on the conclusions of the linguistic experts (see paragraph 30 above) and on several reports confirming that the tape had not been tampered with. 45.The court sentenced the applicant to six and a half years' imprisonment and, having deducted the time already spent in pre-trial detention, conditionally released him on five years' probation. 46.The applicant appealed against the judgment, challenging, inter alia, the admissibility of the evidence obtained through the covert operation and the court's interpretation of the physical evidence and the witnesses' testimonies. 47.On 1 October 2002 the Moscow City Court upheld the applicant's conviction and dismissed his appeal, including the arguments relating to the admissibility of evidence. 48.On 22 June 2004 the Supreme Court of the examined the applicant's case in supervisory proceedings. It modified the judgment of 19 June 2002 and the appeal decision of 1 October 2002, redefining the legal classification of one of the offences committed by the applicant. It found the applicant guilty of “incitement to commit a crime involving a murder”, and not “conspiracy to murder”. The rest of the judgment, including the sentence, remained unchanged. 49.Until 1 July 2002 criminal-law matters were governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the (CCrP). 50.“Preventive measures” or “measures of restraint” included an undertaking not to leave a town or region, personal security, bail and detention on remand (Article 89). A decision to detain someone on remand could be taken by a prosecutor or a court (Articles 11, 89 and 96). 51.When deciding whether to remand an accused in custody, the competent authority was required to consider whether there were “sufficient grounds to believe” that he or she would abscond during the investigation or trial or obstruct the establishment of the truth or reoffend (Article 89). It also had to take into account the gravity of the charge, information on the accused's character, his or her profession, age, state of health, family status and other circumstances (Article 91). 52.Before 14 March 2001, detention on remand was authorised if the accused was charged with a criminal offence carrying a sentence of at least one year's imprisonment or if there were “exceptional circumstances” in the case (Article 96). On 14 March 2001 the CCrP was amended to permit defendants to be remanded in custody if the charge carried a sentence of at least two years' imprisonment or if they had previously defaulted or had no permanent residence in or if their identity could not be ascertained. The amendments of 14 March 2001 also repealed the provision that permitted defendants to be remanded in custody on the sole ground of the dangerous nature of the criminal offence committed. 53.The CCrP provided for a distinction between two types of detention on remand: the first being “during the investigation”, that is, while a competent agency – the police or a prosecutor's office – was investigating the case, and the second being “before the court” (or “during the judicial proceedings”), at the judicial stage. Although there was no difference in practice between them (the detainee was held in the same detention facility), the calculation of the time-limits was different. 54.From the date the prosecutor referred the case to the trial court, the defendant's detention was classified as “before the court” (or “during the judicial proceedings”). 55.Before 14 March 2001 the CCrP did not set any time-limit for detention “during the judicial proceedings”. On 14 March 2001 a new Article 239-1 was inserted which established that the period of detention “during the judicial proceedings” could not generally exceed six months from the date the court received the file. However, if there was evidence to show that the defendant's release might impede a thorough, complete and objective examination of the case, a court could – of its own motion or on a request by a prosecutor – extend the detention by no longer than three months. These provisions did not apply to defendants charged with particularly serious criminal offences. 56.The Operational-Search Activities Act of 12 August 1995 (no.144FZ) provides, in so far as relevant, as follows: Section 6: Operational-search activities “In carrying out investigations the following measures may be taken: ...>supervision of postal, telegraphic and other communications; 10.telephone interception; 11.collection of data from technical channels of communication; ... 14.operative experiments. ... Operational-search activities involving supervision of postal, telegraphic and other communications, telephone interception through [telecommunication companies], and the collection of data from technical channels of communication are to be carried out by technical means by the Federal Security Service and the agencies of the Interior Ministry in accordance with decisions and agreements signed between the agencies involved. ...” Section 8: Conditions governing the performance of operational-search activities “Operational-search activities involving interference with the constitutional right to privacy of postal, telegraphic and other communications transmitted by means of wire or mail services, or with the privacy of the home, may be conducted, subject to a judicial decision, following the receipt of information concerning:>the appearance that an offence has been committed or is ongoing, or a conspiracy to commit an offence whose investigation is mandatory;>persons conspiring to commit, or committing, or having committed an offence whose investigation is mandatory; ... Operative experiments may only be conducted for the detection, prevention, interruption and investigation of a serious crime, or for the identification of persons preparing, committing or having committed it. ...” Section 9: Grounds and procedure for judicial authorisation of operational-search activities involving interference with the constitutional rights of individuals “The examination of requests for the taking of measures involving interference with the constitutional right to privacy of correspondence and telephone, postal, telegraphic and other communications transmitted by means of wire or mail services, or with the right to privacy of the home, shall fall within the competence of a court at the place where the requested measure is to be carried out or at the place where the requesting body is located. The request must be examined immediately by a single judge; the examination of the request may not be refused. ... The judge examining the request shall decide whether to authorise measures involving interference with the above-mentioned constitutional right, or to refuse authorisation, indicating reasons. ...” Section 11: Use of information obtained through operational-search activities “Information gathered as a result of operational-search activities may be used for the preparation and conduct of the investigation and court proceedings ... and used as evidence in criminal proceedings in accordance with legal provisions regulating the collection, evaluation and assessment of evidence. ...” 57.Article 69 of the CCrP provided as follows: “... Evidence obtained in breach of the law shall be considered to have no legal force and cannot be relied on as grounds for criminal charges.” The 2001 Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, which replaced the CCrP of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1 July 2002, provides as follows, in so far as relevant: Article 75: Inadmissible evidence “1.Evidence obtained in breach of this Code shall be inadmissible. Inadmissible evidence shall have no legal force and cannot be relied on as grounds for criminal charges or for proving any of the [circumstances for which evidence is required in criminal proceedings]. ...” Article 235 “...>If a court decides to exclude evidence, that evidence shall have no legal force and cannot be relied on in a judgment or other judicial decision, or be examined or used during the trial. ...”",2009,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

61,001-58833,Grand Chamber,"4.At the time of the introduction of the application, the applicant was serving a prison sentence. The background to his conviction is as follows. According to the Crown’s case the applicant, together with C., S. and another, planned to carry out an armed robbery of a Royal Mail van as it was due to leave the Sorting Office at Sandgate Close in Romford. C. and S. had worked for the Post Office and were familiar with the procedures necessary to send packages of great value through the post. Using up-to-date technology the conspirators posted a letter containing a tracking device. The letter was to appear, in due course, amongst other packages of a similar kind, in a mail van the conspirators proposed to rob. Unknown to them, the police were fully informed as to the robbery that had been planned.>On 26 August 1993, the date of the robbery, the police were keeping the area and conspirators under observation. At 8.40 p.m. an Orion (driven by C.) parked in Crow Lane, with its lights on, near the Post Office depot. S.’s Sierra arrived in Crow Lane. The applicant emerged from S.’s Sierra, dressed entirely in black. He made his way into the cemetery carrying a jacket over his arm. C. in the Orion then followed the Sierra, only to return to Sandgate Close, where he parked the Orion with the headlights on. At 8.46 p.m. the applicant was seen lying down by the railings, inside the cemetery, at a spot directly opposite Sandgate Close where there was a gap in the railings. At 8.49 p.m. he was disturbed by a passing resident, who stopped and spoke to him. He was also spotted by a Post Office employee. The police officers observed the incident. At about 8.50 p.m. the applicant ran further back into the cemetery constantly stopping to face the depot and gesticulating in a manner consistent with his trying to attract the attention of C. in the Orion which was parked opposite. Having disappeared between the bushes for about a minute, he re-appeared, now without his jacket, and ran further into the cemetery where he was arrested by armed officers.>C. was arrested in a motorcar near the mail van. In the car there was a walkie-talkie, a balaclava and some gloves.>Behind a bush where the applicant had been observed crouching at one stage was found a light-coloured jacket with fibres on it matching those from the applicant’s jumper. In the pocket of the jacket were a pair of handcuffs, a sock containing four shotgun cartridges, and a canister of CSgas. Partially buried near the jacket was a balaclava helmet. A short time later a police officer discovered a pair of gloves and a sawn-off shotgun buried nearby. All the items were shown to the applicant whilst still at the scene. He denied all knowledge of them.>S. was stopped after a high-speed car chase. In his car there was another walkie-talkie, through which connection could be made with that found in C.’s car. Yet another car was found abandoned nearby. It was the Crown’s case that that car had been driven by a fourth conspirator. In it was found a device capable of monitoring a police radio.>The trial against the applicant, S. and C. commenced on 18 April 1994 at the Central Criminal Court, London. The following day, C. pleaded guilty and the jury were discharged. On 20 April 1994 the trial of S. and the applicant began before a new jury. On 16 May 1994 the applicant was convicted of conspiracy to rob, possession of a firearm and possession of a prohibited weapon, and he was sentenced to eleven years’ imprisonment. 10.Prior to the start of the trial, on 23 March 1994, the prosecution applied ex parte to the trial judge for an order that they should not be required to disclose certain material to the defence. The defence were told that the material related to sources of information. The contents of the material in question were described to the trial judge by prosecuting counsel. Having later heard submissions from the defence that if any of this information touched upon the applicant’s defence that he had been set up by D.W. (see paragraph 13 below), it ought to be disclosed, on 23 March 1994 the trial judge refused to order disclosure. He stated, inter alia: “... I ... adopted the principle that if something did or might help further the defence then I would order disclosure. I have not ordered disclosure. I have not found it necessary or right to adjourn proceedings, ex parte, in order for them to be inter partes... ” 11.On 25 April 1994, having informed the defence, the Crown made a further ex parte application to the trial judge. Immediately thereafter, the judge held an inter partes hearing on the question whether a witness statement taken from C. after his guilty plea should be disclosed to the defence. During the hearing prosecution counsel described the category of information which had been the subject of the ex parte application: “... the application was two-fold. One part of the ... application ... concerned a renewal of the original ex parte application, namely concerning the source of the information. The second limb upon which approval was sought is such that even to deal with the area upon which it was argued that it ought not to be disclosed would, in fact, reveal what the area was and that particular concern was expressly covered in the case of Davis, Johnson and Rowe [see paragraphs 23-24 below] which was [held] to be one of the exceptions where one does not even state the category in case it result in revealing that which ... ought to be protected.” 12.The judge read the entirety of the unedited witness statement and ruled: “What has happened here is the defendant, [C.], pleaded guilty. The matter was adjourned so that the prosecution could take a statement from him. It is now known that he has made a statement, but he is not to be called as a witness. ... [T]he prosecution has asked me to examine matters ex parte and I am satisfied that that was a correct application, that it was right that I should hear matters ex parte. As I indicated, had I changed my view during the hearing, I would have adjourned and heard the matter inter partes. It is plain to everyone, including each defendant that the statement of [C.] must, first of all, have dealt with preparation of the conspiracy to which he has pleaded guilty and the events of the day upon which he was arrested. The reason the prosecution say they should not serve that part of [C.]’s statement is sources of information in the headline and my decision has been that the prosecution’s attitude is correct. ...” In accordance with the judge’s ruling, the defence were served with a summary of C.’s statement, omitting any reference to sources of information. 13.The applicant gave evidence at trial. It was his case that he had agreed with C., who was his brother-in-law, to bury some items which he understood had been used in connection with a theft of motor vehicles. These items had come from a man called D.W., from whom C. was buying a car. The items had been handed to the applicant by D.W. in two bundles, wrapped in a brown coat, on the evening of 26 August 1993. The applicant said that C. had asked him to bury the bundles at a particular spot in the cemetery. This he had proceeded to do on that evening. After he had buried the items, he put the knife he used for digging the holes and the brown coat into a bag, which he then threw away. He denied all knowledge of the proposed robbery, of the light-coloured jacket, handcuffs, CS canister, shotgun and cartridges. The applicant alleged that he had been falsely implicated in the conspiracy by a participating informer, although he could only speculate as to the identity of the informer and as to that person’s motives. He claimed that C. had been having a relationship with D.W.’s girlfriend, and that D.W. had sought, for purposes of revenge, to make it appear that C. was involved in an armed robbery. 14.On 13 May 1994 the trial judge, in his summing-up to the jury, said: “That there was information from at least one person in this case is accepted and must be the situation, must it not, otherwise why would the police be going to all this trouble watching? Every rule has its exceptions and the law provides if a defendant in his trial is hindered in putting forward his defence by not knowing, first of all, whether or not there was an informer or, if he knows that, not knowing the identity of an informer, an application can be made to the judge and the judge has to be told the identity of the informer, or informers and he may order the prosecution to reveal that if a defendant is prejudiced in his defence. … Well, it will be plain to you that in a case like this where there has been at least one informer, the role of the informer has got to be examined with care and circumspection by you the jury in this trial. If the rules are observed not only by the police but also by the informer, or informers, the informer should not be told not [sic] to initiate crime or to promote it but, if crime is going on, he may be invited to string along with the plan and have a foot in both camps. Of course an informer may overstep the mark, for example, and what is suggested here is that [D.W.] organised really a façade of conspiracy to rob possibly in order to take revenge on [C.] who was messing about with his girl, or for whatever reason (perhaps a reward it is suggested) and you must consider it: has [D.W.] so organised matters that [C.] would be arrested in incriminating circumstances and has [the applicant] been drawn into that web, [S.] possibly also being drawn into that web?” 15.The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal. Subsequent to his conviction he had discovered that C. had provided false information for reward on a number of occasions in the past. Therefore, in the course of the appeal proceedings, the applicant applied to the Court of Appeal for disclosure of some eighty-eight statements previously made by C. relating to alleged confessions to crime made by other prisoners or information about crimes allegedly witnessed or overheard by C. while he was at liberty. This application was refused by the Court of Appeal, which was “not persuaded that there [was] any proper basis for ordering such disclosure”. 16.The applicant relied on two grounds of appeal against conviction. The first ground concerned the rulings by the trial judge and the second related to the witness statement made by C. to the prosecution. It was submitted in particular that: “... In his sentencing remarks the judge specifically referred to the existence of a ‘participating informant’ who was instrumental in both the appellant and [C.] being arrested; this was the first that the defence had heard of the existence of such an informant. In the submission of the appellant, the interests of justice required that the undisclosed material which had been specifically withheld from the defence, and apparently relating to a participating informant, should have been made available to the defence. The defence was materially disadvantaged in presenting its case to the jury by its inability to establish even the existence, let alone the role, of this informant. Without this evidence the defence case of ‘set-up’ rested upon a mere assertion which may well have been regarded by the jury as quite incredible and absurd. ... ... In the submissions of the defence, the actual text of the witness [C.’s] statement, or such part or parts of it as were not covered by recognised public interest immunity or protection, ought to have been disclosed to them. If this was not practicable then a further statement should have been obtained which omitted the objectionable material. The course in fact adopted of giving a ‘summary’ was a naked device to prevent the proper disclosure of admittedly relevant material, and was specifically designed to thereby advantage the Crown and to disadvantage the defence.” 17.On 6 June 1995 the Court of Appeal upheld the applicant’s conviction, observing: “... During the course of the proceedings the prosecution successfully applied ex parte to the judge for an order that they not be required to disclose certain material to the defence, save to the extent that the defence were told that the material related to sources of information. Having later heard submissions from the defence that if any of the material in question touched upon the applicant’s defence that he had been set up by [D.W.], it ought to be disclosed, on 23 March 1994 the judge refused to order any disclosure of the materials. These rulings by the judge are the subject of the first ground of appeal ... It is said that the interests of justice required that the undisclosed material should have been disclosed to the defence. We can see no reason to disagree with the judge’s ruling. He made it clear that if any of the material ‘did or might help the defence’ he would order disclosure. He obviously considered the matter carefully before giving his ruling. There is no substance in this ground of appeal. The second ground of appeal relates to a witness statement made by [C.] as a witness for the Crown. On 25 April 1994 the Crown applied ex parte to the judge to approve the non-disclosure of [C.]’s witness statement and to approve the alternative course proposed by the Crown, which was to provide a summary of the witness statement. The judge granted the application and approved the proposed course. Again, we see no reason to disagree with the judge’s decision in this matter. ... Accordingly, this renewed application for leave to appeal against conviction is refused.” 18.At common law, the prosecution has a duty to disclose any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial. The duty also extends to statements of any witnesses potentially favourable to the defence. 19.In December 1981 the Attorney-General issued Guidelines, which did not have the force of law, concerning exceptions to the common-law duty to disclose to the defence certain evidence of potential assistance to it ([1982] 74 Criminal Appeal Reports 302: “the Guidelines”). The Guidelines attempted to codify the rules of disclosure and to define the prosecution’s power to withhold “unused material”. Under paragraph 1, “unused material” was defined as: “(i) All witness statements and documents which are not included in the committal bundle served on the defence; (ii) the statements of any witnesses who are to be called to give evidence at the committal and (if not in the bundle) any documents referred to therein; (iii) the unedited version(s) of any edited statements or composite statement included in the committal bundles.” Under paragraph 2, any item falling within this definition was to be made available to the defence if “... it ha[d] some bearing on the offence(s) charged and the surrounding circumstances of the case”. 20.According to the Guidelines, the duty to disclose was subject to a discretionary power for prosecuting counsel to withhold relevant evidence if it fell within one of the categories set out in paragraph 6. One of these categories (6(iv)) was “sensitive” material which, because of its sensitivity, it would not be in the public interest to disclose. “Sensitive material” was defined as follows: “... (a) it deals with matters of national security; or it is by, or discloses the identity of, a member of the Security Services who would be of no further use to those services once his identity became known; (b) it is by, or discloses the identity of an informant and there are reasons for fearing that the disclosure of his identity would put him or his family in danger; (c) it is by, or discloses the identity of a witness who might be in danger of assault or intimidation if his identity became known; (d) it contains details which, if they became known, might facilitate the commission of other offences or alert someone not in custody that he is a suspect; or it discloses some unusual form of surveillance or method of detecting crime; (e) it is supplied only on condition that the contents will not be disclosed, at least until a subpoena has been served upon the supplier – e.g. a bank official; (f) it relates to other offences by, or serious allegations against, someone who is not an accused, or discloses previous convictions or other matters prejudicial to him; (g) it contains details of private delicacy to the maker and/or might create risk of domestic strife.” According to paragraph 8, “in deciding whether or not statements containing sensitive material should be disclosed, a balance should be struck between the degree of sensitivity and the extent to which the information might assist the defence”. The decision as to whether or not the balance in a particular case required disclosure of sensitive material was one for the prosecution, although any doubt should be resolved in favour of disclosure. If either before or during the trial it became apparent that a duty to disclose had arisen, but that disclosure would not be in the public interest because of the sensitivity of the material, the prosecution would have to be abandoned. 21.Since 1992 the Guidelines have been superseded by the common law, notably by a number of decisions of the Court of Appeal. In R. v. Ward ([1993] 1 Weekly Law Reports 619) the Court of Appeal dealt with the duties of the prosecution to disclose evidence to the defence and the proper procedure to be followed when the prosecution claimed public interest immunity. It stressed that the court and not the prosecution was to be the judge of where the proper balance lay in a particular case, because: “... [When] the prosecution acted as judge in their own cause on the issue of public interest immunity in this case they committed a significant number of errors which affected the fairness of the proceedings. Policy considerations therefore powerfully reinforce the view that it would be wrong to allow the prosecution to withhold material documents without giving any notice of that fact to the defence. If, in a wholly exceptional case, the prosecution are not prepared to have the issue of public interest immunity determined by a court, the result must inevitably be that the prosecution will have to be abandoned.” The Court of Appeal described the balancing exercise to be performed by the judge as follows: “... a judge is balancing on the one hand the desirability of preserving the public interest in the absence of disclosure against, on the other hand, the interests of justice. Where the interests of justice arise in a criminal case touching and concerning liberty or conceivably on occasion life, the weight to be attached to the interests of justice is plainly very great indeed.” 22.In R. v. Trevor Douglas K. ([1993] 97 Criminal Appeal Reports 342), the Court of Appeal emphasised that, in performing the balancing exercise referred to in R. v. Ward, the court must view the material itself: “In our judgment the exclusion of the evidence without an opportunity of testing its relevance and importance amounted to a material irregularity. When public interest immunity is claimed for a document, it is for the court to rule whether the claim should be upheld or not. To do that involves a balancing exercise. The exercise can only be performed by the judge himself examining or viewing the evidence, so as to have the facts of what it contains in mind. Only then can he be in a position to balance the competing interests of public interest immunity and fairness to the party claiming disclosure.” This judgment also clarified that, where an accused appeals to the Court of Appeal on the ground that material has been wrongly withheld, the Court of Appeal will itself view the material ex parte. 23.In R. v. Davis, Johnson and Rowe ([1993] 1 Weekly Law Reports 613), the Court of Appeal held that it was not necessary in every case for the prosecution to give notice to the defence when it wished to claim public interest immunity, and outlined three different procedures to be adopted. The first procedure, which had generally to be followed, was for the prosecution to give notice to the defence that they were applying for a ruling by the court and indicate to the defence at least the category of the material which they held. The defence then had the opportunity to make representations to the court. Secondly, however, where the disclosure of the category of the material in question would in effect reveal that which the prosecution contended should not be revealed, the prosecution should still notify the defence that an application to the court was to be made, but the category of the material need not be disclosed and the application should be ex parte. The third procedure would apply in an exceptional case where to reveal even the fact that an ex parte application was to be made would in effect be to reveal the nature of the evidence in question. In such cases the prosecution should apply to the court ex parte without notice to the defence. 24.The Court of Appeal observed that although ex parte applications limited the rights of the defence, in some cases the only alternative would be to require the prosecution to choose between following an inter partes procedure or declining to prosecute, and in rare but serious cases the abandonment of a prosecution in order to protect sensitive evidence would be contrary to the public interest. It referred to the important role performed by the trial judge in monitoring the views of the prosecution as to the proper balance to be struck and remarked that even in cases in which the sensitivity of the information required an ex parte hearing, the defence had “as much protection as can be given without pre-empting the issue”. Finally, it emphasised that it was for the trial judge to continue to monitor the position as the trial progressed. Issues might emerge during the trial which affected the balance and required disclosure “in the interests of securing fairness to the defendant”. For this reason it was important for the same judge who heard any disclosure application also to conduct the trial. 25.In R. v. Keane (1994] 1 Weekly Law Reports 747) the Court of Appeal emphasised that, since the ex parte procedure outlined in R. v. Davis, Johnson and Rowe was “contrary to the general principle of open justice in criminal trials”, it should be used only in exceptional cases. It would be an abdication of the prosecution’s duty if, out of an abundance of caution, it were simply “to dump all its unused material in the court’s lap and leave it to the judge to sort through it regardless of its materiality to the issues present or potential”. Thus, the prosecution should put before the court only those documents which it regarded as material but wished to withhold. “Material” evidence was that which could, on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution, be seen (i) to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case; (ii) to raise or possibly raise a new issue the existence of which was not apparent from the evidence the prosecution proposed to use; or (iii) to hold out a real (as opposed to fanciful) prospect of providing a lead of evidence going to (i) or (ii). Exceptionally, in case of doubt about the materiality of the documents or evidence, the court might be asked to rule on the issue. In order to assist the prosecution in deciding whether evidence in its possession was “material”, and the judge in performing the balancing exercise, it was open to the defence to indicate any defence or issue which they proposed to raise. 26.In R. v. Rasheed (The Times, 20 May 1994), the Court of Appeal held that a failure by the prosecution to disclose the fact that a prosecution witness whose evidence was challenged had applied for or received a reward for giving information was a material irregularity which justified overturning a conviction. 27.In R. v. Winston Brown ([1995] 1 Criminal Appeal Reports 191), the Court of Appeal reviewed the operation of the Guidelines. It stated: “The Attorney-General’s objective was no doubt to improve the existing practice of disclosure by the Crown. That was a laudable objective. But the Attorney-General was not trying to make law and it was certainly beyond his power to do so ... The Guidelines are merely a set of instructions to Crown Prosecution Service lawyers and prosecuting counsel ... Judged simply as a set of instructions to prosecutors, the Guidelines would be unobjectionable if they exactly matched the contours of the common law duty of disclosure ... But if the Guidelines, judged by the standards of today, reduce the common-law duties of the Crown and thus abridge the common-law rights of a defendant, they must be pro tanto unlawful... [T]oday, the Guidelines do not conform to the requirements of the law of disclosure in a number of critically important respects. First, the judgment in Ward established that it is for the court, not prosecuting counsel, to decide on disputed questions as to discloseable materials, and on any asserted legal ground to withhold production of relevant material ... For present purposes the point of supreme importance is that there is no hint in the Guidelines of the primacy of the court in deciding on issues of disclosure ... Secondly, the guidelines are not an exhaustive statement of the Crown’s common law duty of disclosure: R. v. Ward at 25 and 681D. To that extent too the Guidelines are out of date. Thirdly, the Guidelines were drafted before major developments in the field of public interest immunity. [I]n paragraph 6 the Guidelines are cast in the form of a prosecutor’s discretion ... Much of what is listed as ‘sensitive material’ is no doubt covered by public interest immunity. But not everything so listed is covered by public interest immunity...” 28.In the case of R. v. Turner ([1995] 1 Weekly Law Reports 264), the Court of Appeal returned to the balancing exercise, stating, inter alia: “Since R. v. Ward ... there has been an increasing tendency for defendants to seek disclosure of informants’ names and roles, alleging that those details are essential to the defence. Defences that the accused has been set up, and allegations of duress, which used at one time to be rare, have multiplied. We wish to alert judges to the need to scrutinise applications for disclosure of details about informants with very great care. They will need to be astute to see that assertions of a need to know such details, because they are essential to the running of the defence, are justified. If they are not so justified, then the judge will need to adopt a robust approach in declining to order disclosure. Clearly, there is a distinction between cases in which the circumstances raise no reasonable possibility that information about the informant will bear upon the issues and cases where it will. Again, there will be cases where the informant is an informant and no more; other cases where he may have participated in the events constituting, surrounding, or following the crime. Even when the informant has participated, the judge will need to consider whether his role so impinges on an issue of interest to the defence, present or potential, as to make disclosure necessary... It is sufficient for us to say that in this case we are satisfied that the information concerning the informant showed a participation in the events concerning this crime which, coupled with the way in which the defence was raised from the very first moment by the defendant when he said that he was being set up, gave rise to the need for the defence to be aware of the identity of the informant and his role in this matter. We, therefore, conclude that if one applies the principle which has been quoted from R. v. Keane ... to the facts of the present case, there could only be one answer to the question as to whether the details concerning this informer were so important to the issues of interest to the defence, present and potential, that the balance which the judge had to strike came down firmly in favour of disclosure.” 29.Subsequent to the applicant’s trial, a new statutory scheme covering disclosure by the prosecution has come into force in England and Wales. Under the 1996 Act, the prosecution must make “primary disclosure” of all previously undisclosed evidence which, in the prosecutor’s view, might undermine the case for the prosecution. The defendant must then give a defence statement to the prosecution and the court, setting out in general terms the nature of the defence and the matters on which the defence takes issue with the prosecution. The prosecution must then make a “secondary disclosure” of all previously undisclosed material “which might reasonably be expected to assist the accused’s defence as disclosed by the defence statement”. Disclosure by the prosecution may be subject to challenge by the accused and review by the trial court. 30.Following the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in Chahal v. the United Kingdom (15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V) and Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom (10 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV) the United Kingdom has introduced legislation making provision for the appointment of a “special counsel” in certain cases involving national security. The provisions are contained in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 (“the 1997 Act”) and the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”). Under this legislation, where it is necessary on national security grounds for the relevant tribunal to sit in camera, in the absence of the affected individual and his or her legal representatives, the Attorney-General may appoint a special counsel to represent the interests of the individual in the proceedings. The legislation provides that the special counsel is not however “responsible to the person whose interest he is appointed to represent”, thus ensuring that the special counsel is both entitled and obliged to keep confidential any information which cannot be disclosed. 31.For example, in the immigration context, the relevant Rules under the 1997 Act are contained in the Special Immigration Appeals Act Commission (Procedure) Rules 1998 (Statutory Instrument no. 1998/1881). Rule 3 provides that in exercising its functions, the Commission shall secure that information is not disclosed contrary to the interests of national security, the international relations of the United Kingdom, the detection and prevention of crime, or in any other circumstances where disclosure is likely to harm the public interest. Rule 7 relates to the special advocate established by section 6 of the 1997 Act. It provides, inter alia: “7.… (4)The function of the special advocate is to represent the interest of the appellant by - (a)making submissions to the Commission in any proceedings from which the appellant or his representative are excluded; (b)cross-examining witnesses at any such proceedings; and (c)making written submissions to the Commission. (5)Except in accordance with paragraphs (6) to (9) the special advocate may not communicate directly or indirectly with the appellant or his representative on any matter connected with proceedings before the Commission. (6)The special advocate may communicate with the appellant and his representative at any time before the Secretary of State makes the material available to him. (7)At any time after the Secretary of State has made the material available under Rule 10(3), the special advocate may seek directions from the Commission authorising him to seek information in connection with the proceedings from the appellant or his representative. (8)The Commission shall notify the Secretary of State of a request for direction under paragraph (7) and the Secretary of State must, within a period specified by the Commission, give the Commission notice of any objection which he has to the request for information being made or to the form in which it is proposed to be made. (9)Where the Secretary of State makes an objection under paragraph (8) Rule 11 shall apply as appropriate.” Rules 10 and 11, to which Rule 7 refers, provide: “10.(1)If the Secretary of State intends to oppose the appeal, he must, no later than 42 days after receiving a copy of the notice of appeal - (a)provide the Commission with a summary of the facts relating to the decision being appealed and the reasons for the decision; (b)inform the Commission of the grounds on which he opposes the appeal; and (c)provide the Commission with a statement of the evidence which he relies upon in support of those grounds. (2)Where the Secretary of State objects to material referred to in paragraph (1) being disclosed to the appellant or his representative, he must also - (a)state the reasons for the objection; and (b)if and to the extent it is possible to do so without disclosing information contrary to the public interest, provide a statement of that material in a form that can be shown to the appellant. (3)Where he makes an objection under paragraph (2), the Secretary of State must make available to the special advocate, as soon as it is practicable to do so, the material which he has provided to the Commission under paragraphs (1) and (2). 11.(1)Proceedings under this Rule shall take place in the absence of the appellant and his representative. (2)The Commission shall decide whether to uphold the Secretary of State’s objection. (3)Before doing so it shall invite the special advocate to make written representations. (4)After considering representations made under paragraph (3) the Commission may - (a)invite the special advocate to make oral representations; or (b)uphold the Secretary of State’s objections without requiring further representations from the special advocate. (5)Where the Commission is minded to overrule the Secretary of State’s objection, or to require him to provide material in different form from that in which he has provided it under Rule 10(2)(b), the Commission must invite the Secretary of State and the special advocate to make oral representations. (6)Where - (a)the Commission overrules the Secretary of State’s objection or requires him to provide material in different form from that in which he has provided it under Rule10(2)(b), and (b)the Secretary of State wishes to oppose the appeal, he shall not be required to disclose any material which was the subject of the unsuccessful objection if he chooses not to rely upon it in opposing the appeal.” 32.In the context of fair employment proceedings in Northern Ireland, the scheme under sections 90 to 92 of the 1998 Act and the relevant Rules is identical to the mechanism adopted under the 1997 Act (above). 33.In addition, the government has recently placed before Parliament two bills which make provision for the appointment of “special counsel” (operating under the same conditions) in other circumstances. The Electronic Communications Bill 1999 provides for the appointment of a “special representative” in proceedings before an Electronic Communications Tribunal to be established for the purpose of examining complaints relating to the interception and interpretation of electronic communications. In the context of criminal proceedings, the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Bill 1999 makes provision for the appointment by the court of a special counsel in any case in which a trial judge prohibits an unrepresented defendant from cross-examining in person the complainant in a sexual offence.",2000,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

These rivers have long been used for the transport of merchandise to and from a large part of the north-western and central European hinterland, and in particular the vast industrial area situated along the River Ruhr in . Over the centuries this geographical situation has allowed the to become one of Europe’s major transport hubs, with harbour and , near , developing into important transit points for goods. 17.In recent years worldwide economic growth, the opening of the borders between the European Union countries and the opening up to foreign trade of central and east European countries have led to an increase in the quantity of merchandise transported through the Netherlands and, consequently, in the volume of traffic. 18.Since the 1980s the volume of transport by inland waterways, rail and pipelines has largely remained stable. It is essentially road transport which has absorbed the increase. This is due to various factors, such as the greater availability and convenience of roads as compared to railways and waterways and the increased tendency of industry to have raw and unfinished materials delivered as and when needed instead of keeping stocks. 19.In the early 1990s the government decided on a policy of maintaining and further improving the competitiveness of harbour as Europe’s main entry and exit port, as compared to its major rivals, , , , and . At the same time it was considered important to prevent, and if possible reduce, congestion of the roads and damage to the environment. 20.On 1 July 1991, in accordance with section 15 of the Council of State Act (Wet op de Raad van State) and upon a proposal of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Verkeer en Waterstaat) and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Environment Management (Volkshuisvesting, Ruimtelijke Ordening en Milieubeheer), the Queen transmitted the Transport Infrastructure Planning Bill (Tracéwet) to the Council of State for an advisory opinion. 21.The Transport Infrastructure Planning Bill was intended to provide a legislative framework for the supra-regional planning of new major transport infrastructure (roads, railways, canals) and major modifications to existing transport infrastructure with a view to simplifying procedures for securing the cooperation of the provincial, regional and local authorities whose territories might be affected. An additional effect was intended to be the concentration of legal remedies in such a way that only one single appeal could be lodged with the Council of State against a decision of central government and all related decisions of subordinate authorities, obviating the need for a plurality of appeals before both the ordinary courts and the Council of State against decisions and plans of local authorities. 22.The Council of State transmitted its advisory opinion to the government on 9 December 1991. Its opening paragraph reads: “The Council of State fully acknowledges the problems that the signatories to the Transport Infrastructure Planning Bill wish to resolve. It often concerns large, technically complex and expensive infrastructure projects. These must not only be balanced against diverse and weighty interests relating to traffic and transport, road safety, town and country planning and the environment, but in addition it is desirable to have the widest possible public support for these projects. The current decision-making procedure – entailing a non-statutory routing determination following which final decisions are only made in accordance with the town and country planning procedure, against which an appeal may be lodged with a judge – can take much time. Furthermore, where a number of provincial and municipal bodies are involved, the decision-making process is diffused over several regional and local zoning plans. The Council of State therefore shares the government’s concern about the outlined problems. It will examine hereafter whether, in its opinion, the proposals made will in practice sufficiently resolve the problems and whether the concomitant disadvantages are acceptable.” 23.In its opinion the Council of State noted, among other things, the absence of any binding time-limits for the administrative authorities. It expressed doubts as to whether the procedure under the new bill, if enacted, would be any shorter than the aggregate of separate procedures necessary hitherto. It also considered that the new bill created uncertainty at the lower levels of government (the provinces, the regional surface waterboards (waterschappen) and the municipalities) by bypassing the planning structures of those lower bodies; in addition, insufficient weight was given to the justifiable interests of individuals. It found that the considerable limitation of legal protection constituted an important objection to the new bill. 24.Point 8 of the advisory opinion reads: “Having reached the end of the examination of the legal protection in the framework of this bill, from which it can be seen that the Council of State has serious objections to the removal of a routing determination [tracévaststelling] from general town and country planning considerations, it nevertheless wishes to point out that, when the Council of State leaves aside here the problem dealt with under point 2 (length of the decision-making process under the bill), those serious objections would be less weighty if the bill only related to routing determinations of such exceptional (supra)national importance that it must be clear to anyone that in the case in question the provincial, regional and local interests should yield to them. In that case, the routing plans [tracés] referred to in section 24b should be explicitly mentioned in the bill. It would be preferable to reconsider the bill in this sense.” 25.The Council of State made a number of suggestions for improving the drafting of the bill before it was transmitted to Parliament. Its final conclusion reads: “The Council of State advises you not to send this bill to the Lower House of the States General until the above observations have been taken into account.” 26.In their reply of 28 January 1992 the Minister for Transport and Communications and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Environment Management noted – as regards the doubts expressed by the Council of State as to whether the new procedure would be appreciably shorter than the former one – among other things that it might take a very long time to obtain the cooperation of the local authorities. It was also stated that the local authorities were involved in all stages of the procedure, being informed and consulted as the need arose; if it was necessary to compel their cooperation, this was done at the final stage, that of the routing decision. Legal protection of the justified interests of individuals was sufficiently guaranteed in the form of a single appeal, on legal grounds, against a routing decision. 27.As to the remarks made under point 8 of the advisory opinion of the Council of State, the ministerial response reads as follows: “With the approval of the Council of Ministers (decision of 24 January 1992), we decided to include in the bill a separate regulation for large projects of national importance. In line with this, the transitory arrangement referred to in section 24b will be concentrated on the high-speed railway and the ‘Betuweroute’ [railway]. The original section 24b was included exclusively in view of these projects and can now be dropped, as a provision will be devoted to these projects. Since, with the inclusion of the special procedure for large projects and the above-indicated transitional arrangement, the bill will be further amended, we find it desirable to consult the Council of State on this. The amendments to the bill will therefore be submitted for advice to the Council of State in the form of a ministerial memorandum of amendments.” 28.The Minister for Transport and Communications made a number of changes to the bill in the light of the Council of State’s criticism. The amendments were submitted to the Council of State for advice on 6February 1992. 29.In its advisory opinion of 8 May 1992, the Council of State considered, inter alia: “... it desirable to indicate in section 24g that the notions ‘high-speed railway’ and ‘Betuweroute’ railway relate to specific [railway] connections between specifically named places.” 30.The ministerial reply of 19 May 1992 to this recommendation states: “This advice has been followed. It is now indicated in section 24g that the high-speed railway relates to the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Belgian border route, and the ‘Betuweroute’ [railway] to the Rotterdam-Zevenaar route.” 31.The government then submitted the bill to the Lower House (Tweede Kamer) of Parliament, together with the Council of State’s advisory opinion and the ministers’ comments. The Transport Infrastructure Planning Act eventually entered into force on 1 January 1994. It contains no specific mention of the high-speed railway or the Betuweroute railway, but does provide for a special procedure for projects of national importance. 32.An existing railway through the Betuwe region (the area circumscribed by the rivers Rhine, Lek and Waal) – known as the “Betuwe line” (Betuwelijn) – links the city of to the town of . It was, and still is, mainly used for passenger traffic and is operated at a loss. As early as 1985 a government committee suggested converting it for use solely for the transport of goods, extending it as far as the town of and connecting it to the German railway system. A study commissioned by the Netherlands Railways (Nederlandse Spoorwegen – “the NS”) and published in 1991 concluded that the environmental impact would be unacceptable and that the capacity of such a railway line would be insufficient. 33.This led the government to reject that idea. Instead, the government decided to investigate the possibility of building a new railway through the Betuwe, to be known as the “Betuweroute”, along the A15 motorway. The NS was required to prepare an environmental impact report (milieu-effectrapportage). 34.On 16 April 1992 the Minister for Transport and Communications and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Environment Management together presented the first draft of the outline planning decision (Planologische Kernbeslissing) within the meaning of section 2a of the Town and Country Planning Act (Wet op de Ruimtelijke Ordening), which later became known as “Outline Planning Decision – Part 1”. The environmental impact report prepared by the NS was appended to this document. Pursuant to the then applicable section 2a of the Town and Country Planning Act, it was laid open for public inspection, notice of its publication being given through the Netherlands Government Gazette (Staatscourant) and the media. Anyone interested could then make his or her views known. The time-limit for doing so was 27 July 1992. More than 1,800 reactions were received. 35.On 31 August 1992 the Minister for Transport and Communications signed an agreement with his German counterpart, the Federal Minister for Transport, for increased cooperation in the matter of cross-border railway communication. The agreement provided – subject to the conclusion of procedures prescribed by national law – for, inter alia, the building of a new railway from to the German border via Zevenaar. There were to be two border crossings, one at Oldenzaal/Bad Bentheim and the other at Venlo/Kaldenkirchen. The agreement also provided for corresponding measures to be taken on the German side and for a time frame. 36.On 18 April 1993 the government published a document entitled “Reacties op de Ontwerp Planologische Kernbeslissing Betuweroute” (Reactions to the Betuweroute Outline Planning Decision). It contained an overview of the reactions to Outline Planning Decision – Part 1 sent in by individuals and the results of further consultations and discussions with local government bodies, that is provinces, municipalities and regional surface waterboards. Advice obtained from the Netherlands-German Planning Board (Nederlands-Duitse Commissie voor de Ruimtelijke Ordening), the Environmental Impact Reports Board (Commissie milieu-effectrapportage), the Planning Advisory Board (Raad van Advies voor de Ruimtelijke Ordening) and the Traffic Infrastructure Consultation Body (Overlegorgaan Verkeersinfrastructuur) was also included in this document, which became known as Outline Planning Decision – Part 2. 37.On 18 May 1993 the government published their views on the Betuweroute project and transmitted it to the Lower House of Parliament for approval. This document became known as Outline Planning Decision – Part 3. After deliberations, the Lower House of Parliament sent Outline Planning Decision – Part 3 back to the government with its comments. 38.The government made certain modifications. The resulting document, which became known as Outline Planning Decision – Part 3A, was submitted to the Lower House of Parliament on 14 December 1993 for approval. 39.Outline Planning Decision – Part 3A was approved by the Lower House of Parliament on 22 December 1993 and, on 12 April 1994, by the Upper House (Eerste Kamer) of Parliament. It became known thereafter as Outline Planning Decision – Part 4 and came into force after its publication in the Netherlands Government Gazette on 27 May 1994. 40.Outline Planning Decision – Part 4 contained an explanatory memorandum setting out the need for the Betuweroute, as perceived by the government, and giving reasons for the choices made. It was stated that , the ’ main port, and , now served most of the European continent and that the increase in the volume of transport could not be absorbed by inland waterway traffic alone. Moreover, much of the European hinterland could not be reached by water. Road traffic could not be the only alternative, as it was relatively expensive, uneconomical over long distances and environmentally unfriendly. Furthermore, in much of eastern Europe the railway infrastructure was better developed and in a better state of repair than the roads. 41.Other European countries, including , and the Alpine countries, were investing heavily in railways in order to relieve the roads. had undertaken to connect its railway system to the Betuweroute, and would give effect to this undertaking as soon as the decision to build the Betuweroute was taken. The transport policies developed by the European Economic Community also provided for the development of new railways. 42.The explanatory memorandum contained summaries of studies – additional to that undertaken by the NS in 1991 – that had been commissioned by the government, namely a study on the macro-economic and social effects by Knight Wendling and a micro-economic analysis by McKinsey. Both studies concluded that the Betuweroute would be profitable. They were scrutinised by the Central Planning Office (Centraal Planbureau). The results of this appraisal were also rendered in summary form. The government considered that although the conclusions of the Central Planning Office were rather more guarded, they too indicated that the project was viable. 43.Other alternatives were taken into consideration. These included increasing the capacity of an existing railway running from through the southern to and from there into (the “Brabantroute”), used mainly for passenger traffic, and making it more suitable for the transport of goods. This alternative was rejected on the ground that it would require building two extra tracks. Moreover, the urban density along the Brabant route being three to four times as high as that along the projected Betuweroute, this would cause severe and unacceptable problems. 44.Alternatives not involving railways, which had been suggested after Outline Planning Decision – Part 1 had been laid open for public inspection, were discarded in view of the need to connect to the existing railway infrastructure in the rest of Europe. The importance of inland navigation was nonetheless recognised, and it was stated that in both the and inland port facilities were undergoing further development. 45.Alternative methods of constructing the railway had been suggested in the wake of Outline Planning Decision – Part 1. Many of those who had stated their views on the matter had expressed a preference for an underground tunnel or for open tracks sunk below ground level. These were considered, but rejected as the cost would be prohibitive. A traditional construction was chosen consisting of rail tracks resting on a sand base and located mostly at ground level, a raised or lowered track being envisaged only for locations where such was called for by considerations of safety or environmental impact. Similarly, conventional rather than innovative technology was chosen. 46.Outline Planning Decision – Part 4 provided for a twin-track railway. Its location was fixed as far as possible within a horizontal band of 100 m. Within this band limited adjustment to local conditions would be possible, it being understood that any additional features such as drainage ditches or other traffic infrastructure might have to be located outside it. The actual route was set out in sketch plans, with reasons being given for the choices made and for the rejection of alternatives. 47.Consideration was given to possible harmful effects. Thus, although under the legislation in force (Article 7 of the Railway Noise Ordinance – Besluit geluidhinder spoorwegen) the maximum permissible noise level was 60 decibel ampere (dBA) on the outside walls of residential buildings, a “preferential noise level” of 57 dBA would be applied in anticipation of stricter standards which were expected to come into force in 2000. Where it appeared in practice that this could not be achieved, noise levels would be reduced by means of screens. Exceptionally, noise levels of up to 70 dBA might be tolerated at specific locations, but even there they were not to exceed 37 dBA inside residential buildings with the windows closed and ventilation apertures open. Although there might be an accumulation of noise from the A15 motorway and the Betuweroute railway, it was considered that the railway would contribute less noise than the louder motorway traffic, so that it would be possible, by screening and other measures, to reduce the combined noise levels to 60 dBA. 48.Some 150 residential buildings were found to be located within 50 m of the projected railway track. It was estimated that approximately one quarter of these were so close to the projected track that noise levels would compel the termination of their residential function. Studies had also been conducted regarding the vibration likely to be caused and the standards to be applied on this point. Further studies would be undertaken with a view to taking constructive measures aimed at reducing vibration levels. 49.The danger that might be result from the operation of the Betuweroute railway was also considered, although not in detail. It was intended to build the railway so that the “individual risk” would be no greater than 10-6 near residential areas. The “group risks” would be kept “as low as reasonably achievable”. Specific measures would be set out in the routing decision. 50.There had been an audit of the costs of the project as proposed by the government, which, as was estimated at 1993 cost levels, would amount to a total of 7,138,000,000 guilders (NLG). Of this sum a portion of NLG 1,975,000,000 would be paid out of the State budget. The remaining NLG 5,163,000,000 would be raised from other sources, such as the financial markets, windfall profits from the sale of natural gas and funds supplied by the EEC. The total figure included a sum of NLG 750,000,000 occasioned by changes imposed by the Lower House of Parliament and NLG 375,000,000 required to meet objections and special requests made by individuals and local authorities. 51.A new government took office on 22 August 1994, which in pursuance of agreements reached between the coalition parties reconsidered the Betuweroute plan in its entirety. After obtaining the views of a parliamentary committee (the “Hermans Committee”), the new government decided that the plan should go ahead. Its views were made public in a letter sent by the Minister for Transport and Communications and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Environment Management to the Lower House of Parliament on 21 April 1995. On 29 June 1995 the Lower House of Parliament endorsed the government’s views. 52.In accordance with the procedure for projects of national importance under the Transport Infrastructure Planning Act which had come into force on 1 January 1994, a preliminary draft of the routing decision – containing the determination of the exact routing of the planned railway – was laid open for public inspection in June 1994, together with an addition to the environmental impact report and a survey of expected noise levels. Some 5,500 reactions were received from individuals, nongovernmental organisations and local-government bodies. These led to modifications, which were incorporated into the draft routing decision. 53.The draft routing decision was published on 4 March 1996 and laid open for public inspection until 29 April 1996. More than 600 reactions were received from individuals and local-government bodies. Changes were considered, and eventually incorporated into the final routing decision, in so far as they did not affect the projected route, did not require additional expenditure and did not affect the interests of other parties. Changes made included, for certain locations, noise-reduction measures in addition to those foreseen in Outline Planning Decision – Part 4. 54.The routing decision was finalised on 26 November 1996 by the Minister for Transport and Communications in agreement with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Environment Management. It covered most of the projected track of the new Betuweroute railway, with the exception of a number of locations – not concerned by the present case – for which further planning was required. 55.The routing decision comprises twenty-four Articles, creating a legal framework for the measures required, and a set of detailed maps with explanations. In its published form it is accompanied by an extensive explanatory part setting out the outline of the choices made. 56.A series of tests had been carried out from which it appeared that goods trains made rather more noise than had initially been estimated. It was stated that a reduction of noise levels was expected from modifications to the rolling stock (reduction at source). However, in case these should not be sufficient, screens would be erected where necessary regardless of the expected reductions at source. Further reductions were expected from the use of modern concrete sleepers instead of the conventional wooden ones on which the initial noise level assessments had been based. Finally, if the noise levels still turned out to be too high in practice, other measures would be considered, such as further modifications to rolling stock, avoiding operations at night and lowering maximum speeds. The standards to be applied, including those with regard to the accumulation of noise caused by the new railway and the A15 motorway, were those set out in Outline Planning Decision – Part 4. Stricter standards would be applied in the vicinity of sensitive locations such as hospitals and schools and certain designated rural areas (stiltegebieden – “silent areas”). The residential function of buildings where the noise levels would be excessive would have to be terminated. A detailed report setting out the noise levels for each municipality was appended to the routing decision. 57.Compensating measures for the preservation of the environment and the existing landscape were to include, among other things, the provision of culverts (to enable wildlife and cattle to cross underneath the railway) and of appropriate vegetation. Special measures were also envisaged for the protection of any known archaeological sites. 58.Consideration was also given to special measures required by the nature of the subsoil, which provided less support in the western part of the country than in the east; hence the need for additional supporting shoulders in certain areas. The need, at some locations, for cleaning polluted soil was noted. 59.Indications were given of how noise reduction screens, bridges and viaducts were to be built, and of how the railway would be sunk below ground level where this was unavoidable, an important objective being to limit the railway’s visual and environmental impact while maintaining its visual unity and continuity. Where the Betuweroute crossed existing traffic infrastructure – roads, existing railways, cycle paths – safety was the main consideration. Changes to existing ditches and waterways were unavoidable. Construction details of the electrical installations would, however, depend on the final decision on the electrical system to be used, which would be taken at a later date. 60.A total of 173 appeals against Outline Planning Decision – Part 3A were lodged with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak) of the Council of State, many jointly by a plurality of appellants. With the exception of the applicants Mr and Mrs Raymakers (no.43147/98), who only raised objections of a general nature to Outline Planning Decision – Part 3A, all applicants in the present case submitted specific complaints about the proposed route of the railway in so far as their respective interests would be affected. 61.The bench of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division dealing with the appeals was composed of three ordinary councillors (Staatsraden) of the Council of State, namely Mr J. de Vries (President), Mr R. Cleton and MrR.H. Lauwaars (members). Mr de Vries had been appointed Ordinary Councillor in 1982. Mr Cleton and Mr Lauwaars had been appointed ordinary councillors in 1992 and 1994 respectively. 62.On 31 January 1997, after sixteen hearings held between July and September 1996, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division delivered its decision. It rejected all the complaints of a general nature. 63.As to the specific complaints, it noted that Outline Planning Decision – Part 3A was not yet final as regards the definitive route of the railway. It therefore limited the scope of its review, for each separate location, to the question whether the government could reasonably have set the band as it had and, if so, whether it could reasonably have considered that an acceptable route was possible within the band specified or that, in view of possible measures to be taken, the interests of the affected appellants had been adequately taken into account. It reserved its opinion on the definitive location of the railway, which was to be the subject of the routing decision. 64.One group of general complaints addressed, inter alia, the assessment made by the government of the need for a new railway. These were rejected with reference to government policy aimed at maintaining and strengthening the position of the as a European hub for transport and distribution. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division concluded that the government’s assessment of the need to construct the railway did not appear incorrect or unreasonable. 65.Another group of general complaints challenged the government’s estimates of the railway’s macro-economic effects and its profitability and the financial calculations underlying the government’s plans. These were rejected on the ground that the said estimates did not appear incorrect or unreasonable in view of the expert reports which the government had commissioned. 66.A further group of general complaints challenged the government’s failure to choose the most environmentally friendly alternative. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division held that the government could reasonably have come to the decision – having weighed alternatives and decided to give priority to human interests – to choose the most cost-effective solution and to use only proven technology. Where specific problems were alleged to arise, these would be dealt with separately. General complaints concerning expected noise and vibration levels, risk assessments, deprivation of property and the likelihood of damage were rejected as being either unfounded on the facts or premature given that these problems would be addressed for specific locations in the routing decision. 67.Specific complaints of twenty-two appellants were accepted as being well-founded, which led to parts of Outline Planning Decision – Part 3A (and therefore Outline Planning Decision – Part 4) being annulled. None of those twenty-two appellants are applicants in the present case. 68.As regards the specific complaints which were rejected, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division held either that it could not be established in advance of the routing decision that the railway could not be located within the band in such a way as to meet the objections, or that the appellants’ objections could not be met in another way, for instance by relocating business premises or offering financial compensation. 69.The decision ran to 292 pages, to which maps were appended indicating locations in respect of which parts of Outline Planning Decision – Part 3A were annulled. 70.In total 147 appeals were lodged with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division against the Betuweroute Routing Decision. Many of these appeals were introduced by a plurality of appellants, including the applicants in the present case. As was the case in the appeals against Outline Planning Decision – Part 3A, a large number of appellants made complaints of a general nature dealing with such matters as the procedure followed. Some challenged the government’s refusal to consider modifications of the routing decision unless the objections put forward were of a very serious nature. Others questioned the need or desirability for building the railway at all or objected to the procedure for assessing expected noise levels. 71.The composition of the bench of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division dealing with the appeals against the routing decision was the same as the bench that had determined the appeals against Outline Planning Decision – Part 3A (see paragraph 61 above). It commenced its examination of the appeals on 18 November 1997. 72.In the course of a public hearing held on 2 December 1997, Mr and Mrs Raymakers challenged the entire membership of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division and, in the alternative, all the councillors of that Division with the exception of the extraordinary councillors (Staatsraden in buitengewone dienst), and in the further alternative, the councillors sitting on the case, on the ground of lack of impartiality. They argued that, since the Plenary Council of State (Volle Raad) was involved in advising the government on proposed legislation, it was inconsistent with Article 6 of the Convention that members of that body should subsequently decide in a judicial capacity on the application of legislation once it had been adopted. 73.A hearing on this challenge was held on 9 December 1997 before a special Chamber of three members of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division who were not involved in hearing the appeal, that is MrE.KorthalsAltes (President), Mr A.G. van Galen and Mr C. de Gooyer (members), all of whom were extraordinary councillors of the Council of State. 74.Mr and Mrs Raymakers cited the ’s judgment of 28September 1995 in Procola v. Luxembourg (Series A no.326). They noted similarities between the organisation and functioning of the Netherlands Council of State and the Conseil d’Etat and quoted several comments published in the legal press by learned authors. 75.Given that the Council of State’s advice on the introduction of the Transport Infrastructure Planning Act had been worded “in generally positive terms” and therefore conflicted with these applicants’ own interest in maintaining the status quo, they considered that that advice had been contrary to their own position in their appeal. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division was therefore not an “impartial tribunal”. These applicants therefore asked the special Chamber to rule that the Administrative Jurisdiction Division should decline to make any decision in the case. 76.On 10 December 1997 the special Chamber of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division gave its decision. It held that, under section 8(15) of the General Administrative Law Act (Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht), a challenge could only be directed against judges who were dealing with the case of the party concerned. As to the challenge of the entire membership of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division, it was pointed out that if the Administrative Law Act had provided otherwise, no member of such a tribunal would in fact be in a position to entertain the challenge. Consequently, in so far as the applicants’ challenge was directed against members of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division who were not involved in hearing the applicants’ appeal, it was inadmissible. The challenge directed against the members who were so involved was rejected in the following terms: “The Division considers that under section 8(15) of the General Administrative Law Act each of the members who decide a case can be removed from it [gewraakt] on the application of a party on the grounds of facts or circumstances by which judicial impartiality might be impaired. The Division deduces therefrom that only a lack of impartiality on the part of a judge can lead to his removal from a case. Neither the wording nor the drafting history of that provision offers support for the contention that a lack of independence of the tribunal to which a judge belongs can constitute grounds for that judge’s removal from a case. For this reason alone the appellants’ submissions at the hearing cannot lead to their application being granted. As to the appellants’ reliance on Procola, the Division considers that the appeal lodged by the appellants with the Division does not raise questions on which the Council of State has, in advisory opinions on the legislation that is at issue in this appeal, expressed itself in a way contrary to the position taken by the appellants in their appeal. There is therefore no reason to fear that the members of the Council of State who are charged with deciding the appeal will consider themselves bound by any position adopted by the Council of State in the relevant advisory opinions.” 77.The hearing on the merits was resumed on 25 February 1998 and, on 28 May 1998, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division delivered its decision, which ran to 354 pages. 78.General complaints relating to the refusal of the government to consider modifications to the routing decision unless the objections put forward were of a very serious nature were dismissed on the ground that this was not unreasonable per se; it was more appropriate to consider the objections in question individually. General complaints relating to the necessity or desirability of building the railway at all – including complaints about the environmental impact report – were also dismissed. These had already been considered as part of the appeals against Outline Planning Decision – Part 3A. The question was no longer whether the building of the Betuweroute was acceptable, but only whether, in coming to the routing decision, the government could reasonably have decided as it had. 79.The complaint made by several appellants that the routing decision was taken before the appeals against the outline planning decision had been determined was rejected by the Administrative Jurisdiction Division. It held that, under section 24(5) of the Transport Infrastructure Planning Act, the period for lodging an appeal against decisions taken in an outline planning decision and against the routing decision based thereon started to run simultaneously and that, therefore, it was normal that a routing decision was already taken before the outline planning decision had become final. It further considered that it did not follow from the Transport Infrastructure Planning Act that where, like in the present case, a separate appeal lay against an outline planning decision, no routing decision could be taken before the outline planning decision had become final. The mere fact that the time-limits for appealing started to run independently did not, according to the Administrative Jurisdiction Division, alter the tenor of section 24(5) of the Transport Infrastructure Planning Act that no final outline planning decision was required for a routing decision to be taken on the basis of that decision. 80.As to noise levels, the various complaints were to be considered individually. General complaints concerning the determination of acceptable noise levels could not be entertained. Reasonable standards had been set by law, and actual noise would be monitored once the railway was in use. The safety studies were not held to have been insufficient. It was noted that there had been an additional study made in respect of areas where the concentration of the population, and therefore the group risk, was greatest. Moreover, the government had specified additional safety measures for these areas in its statement of defence, as well as specific ways of operating the railway so as to minimise the dangers attending the transport of dangerous goods. As to the individual risk, the routing decision provided that new development which would increase it within 30 m from the centre line of the track would be prevented; this made it unlikely that the individual risk would be increased further away from the track. Other objections relating to safety considerations would be dealt with on an individual basis. 81.As to vibration levels, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division held that the government could not be found to have acted unreasonably by basing its assessments on an industrial standard (DIN 4150) rather than a different standard suggested by certain appellants. Nor was the assessment of the likely nuisance caused by vibration unreasonable per se. Moreover, the government had undertaken to provide active monitoring (that is, to measure vibration levels of its own motion) in all residential buildings located within 50 m of the railway once it was in use, and passive monitoring (that is, to measure vibration levels after complaints were received) in residential buildings located 50 to 100 m from the railway. The government would then deal with unacceptable nuisance on a case-by-case basis. Specific problems raised by appellants would be dealt with individually. 82.With regard to general complaints about the arrangements for compensating damage, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division referred generally to the relevant provisions of the routing decision. It further noted that legal remedies were available against any specific decisions taken in this regard. It could therefore not yet be assumed at this stage that acceptable arrangements in respect of damage were not possible. 83.As to the appeal lodged by Mettler Toledo B.V. (no. 39651/98), whose extremely accurate device for calibrating scales was stated to be particularly sensitive to vibration, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division noted that studies were still ongoing as to whether the vibration likely to be caused by the railway would unduly interfere with that company’s business. That being so, Mettler Toledo B.V.’s claims could not be dismissed as unfounded; to that extent, the appeal was allowed. 84.Sterk Technisch Adviesbureau B.V. (no. 39651/98), whose premises would have to be relocated, complained that no sufficient clarity had been provided as to whether a new location of equivalent quality would be made available. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division held this complaint to be well-founded. This made it unnecessary to go into other specific complaints made by this applicant. 85.With regard to a complaint submitted jointly by Mr A.A. Kleyn (no.39343/98) and Kleijn Financierings- en Leasemaatschappij B.V., Exploitatiemaatschappij De Zeiving B.V., Ms C.J.P. Kleijn, Ms P.M. Kleijn and Ms C.J. Kleijn (no. 39651/98) in respect of the restaurant “De Goudreinet” which they owned and the flat inhabited by Mr A.A. Kleyn, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division found that no investigation had been undertaken as to whether it would be possible for these to continue in use. To that extent the complaint was therefore well-founded. The remainder of their appeal was dismissed. 86.As regards the appeal lodged by Mr M. Witvliet (no. 46664/99), the Administrative Jurisdiction Division rejected the objections to a possible expropriation, holding that such objections could be raised in the specific procedure set out in the Expropriation Act (Onteigeningswet). As to his complaint about nuisance from noise in a particular area, it was held that this element had been insufficiently examined. To that extent, his appeal was well-founded. The remainder was rejected. 87.The Administrative Jurisdiction Division rejected the appeals lodged by the other individual applicants and applicant companies. 88.In so far as the appeals were considered well-founded, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division annulled the routing decision and made an award in respect of costs. 89.In a letter to the Lower House of Parliament of 13 July 1998 the Minister for Transport and Communications, writing also on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Environment Management, observed that the decision of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division left 95% of the routing decision intact. It was therefore not necessary either to undertake a radical review of the project or to interrupt the building work. It was expected that the Betuweroute railway would be operational by 2005. 90.In so far as minor parts of the routing decision had been annulled, the reason therefor had merely been that insufficient information had been obtained as to whether the interests of the appellants could be safeguarded. In so far as relevant to the present case, the minister expected that in all but one or two cases changes to the original routing decision would prove unnecessary. 91.New partial routing decisions were taken in the course of 1998. An appeal lodged by Mettler Toledo B.V. was declared inadmissible by the Administrative Jurisdiction Division on 16 April 1999. The appeal lodged by Sterk Technisch Adviesbureau B.V. was dismissed by the Administrative Jurisdiction Division on 25 October 1999. The appeals lodged by Kleijn Financierings- en Leasemaatschappij B.V., Exploitatiemaatschappij De Zeiving B.V., Ms C.J.P. Kleijn, Ms P.M. Kleijn, Ms C.J. Kleijn and MrA.A. Kleyn were dismissed by the Administrative Jurisdiction Division on 25 July 2000. Mr Witvliet apparently did not lodge an appeal against any of the 1998 routing decisions. 92.In response to suggestions made in the media to reconsider the Betuweroute project, the Minister for Transport and Communications sent a note (Notitie Betuweroute) to the Lower House of Parliament on 6November 1998. In this note the minister restated the considerations which had led to the decision of 1995 to allow the project to go ahead. She also expressed the view that no new information had become available since the reconsideration of 1995 which would tend to undermine earlier assumptions as to the viability and desirability of the project. On the contrary, developments had been such as to endorse these. 93.On 13 April 1999 the Stichting Duurzame Mobiliteit (Durable Mobility Foundation) – one of the appellants against the routing decision but not one of the applicants in the present case – lodged a request for revision (herziening) of the decisions of 31 January 1997 and 28 May 1998 with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division. This appellant argued that the government had either been insufficiently aware of certain relevant factual information at the time when it finalised Outline Planning Decision – Part3A or had failed to consider this information. 94.In a decision of 9 March 2000 the Administrative Jurisdiction Division refused to revise its decisions. It found that the information in question was not of such a nature as to justify reopening the proceedings. 95.From August 1999 until February 2000 the Chamber of Audit (Algemene Rekenkamer) undertook a study of the Betuweroute decision-making process. It published its report on 22 June 2000 under the title “Beleidsinformatie Betuweroute” (Betuweroute Policy Information). 96.The purpose of the report was to provide guidance for the quality and use of information relied on by the government to ground future policy decisions relating to large infrastructure projects. The central questions were whether the quality of the information relied on in taking Betuweroute policy decisions was assured and whether this information had been used in a responsible way in the preparation of the decision-making process. Developments subsequent to the reconsideration of 1995 were taken into account. 97.The Chamber of Audit found that in the initial stages an adequate analysis of the problems to be solved had not been made. The decision-making process had related one-sidedly to the solution chosen, namely the construction of the Betuweroute railway, it having been decided at the outset that that was beneficial for the national economy and the environment; an expert analysis of the information on which the outline planning decision was based had not been sought. 98.Predictions concerning the expected volume of transport through the were considered imprecise and unreliable. The predictions eventually relied on appeared overly optimistic; also, in some cases, it was not clear on what considerations the preference for particular predictions over others was based. Uncertainty remained, inter alia, as to the capacity of the German railway system to absorb the increased volume of goods traffic. The increasing competitiveness of inland navigation had not been considered, nor had the slow progress in some European countries (for example, and ) of the liberalisation of rail transport. Nor had account been taken of the possible effects of levies on road transport as against the passing on of the costs of railway infrastructure to shippers, the latter possibility being envisaged in a policy proposal of the European Commission. 99.Alternatives to the Betuweroute had not been sufficiently explored. The Chamber of Audit criticised the way in which the use of the existing railway infrastructure in the and waterborne inland and coastal transport had been considered in isolation rather than in combination. A thorough analysis of the possibilities of optimising existing east-west transport, including existing railway infrastructure, was lacking. Possible future developments in inland waterway traffic, which already accounted for a greater volume of transport than railways, had not been looked into. 100.The assumed environmental benefit had also been misstated. The information concerning the environmental impact of alternatives to the Betuweroute railway had been inadequate and had been used in a selective way. Attention had been focused on the immediate reduction of energy use and noxious emissions without taking into account technical developments such as the increased use of cleaner and more economical engines in alternative transport; insufficient information had been provided concerning such matters as nuisance levels, external safety or soil and groundwater pollution attending alternative choices. 101.A positive feature of the process, given especially the public discussion which had arisen, was that the project had been reconsidered in its entirety in 1995 and that the arguments in favour had been presented anew in 1998 (the Betuweroute Note – see paragraph 92 above). However, the information available at those times and the way in which it had been used was open to criticism. 102.The draft of the report was transmitted in its entirety to the government. The Minister for Transport and Communications, in a reaction submitted also on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Environment Management, expressed broad agreement with the report although some of the individual findings were contested. The conclusions of the Chamber of Audit were accepted for future reference. 103.Parts of the draft report were transmitted to the NS Railway Infrastructure Division and to Railned, the government entity which operated the railway system. The Railway Infrastructure Division disagreed with certain findings of the Chamber of Audit with regard to environmental impact estimates. Railned called into question some of the findings of the Chamber of Audit with regard to the predicted increase in the volume of rail transport. 104.The full report, including the reactions, was transmitted to the Lower House of Parliament (parliamentary year 1999-2000, 27 195, nos.12). 105.Section 2a of the Town and Country Planning Act empowers the Minister for Housing, Planning and Environment Management together with the other ministers concerned in each case to prepare plans, known as outline planning decisions, for particular aspects of national planning policy (section 2a(1)). At the relevant time (that is before 1 January 1994) the draft for such a plan was required to be laid open for public inspection for a period of between one and three months, an announcement being made beforehand in the Netherlands Government Gazette and the local media. Anyone minded to do so could submit their views for a period of one month after the end of the inspection period (section 2a(2)). The draft was transmitted to the Lower House of Parliament for information at the time of its being laid open for public inspection (section 2a(5)). 106.The ministers were required to consult the authorities of the provinces, regional surface waterboards, municipalities and any other public-law entities, as appropriate, about the draft (section 2a(3)). The advice of the Planning Advisory Board had to be sought (section 2a(4)). 107.The ministers were then required to transmit the outline planning decision – which by this time no longer had the status of a draft – to the Lower House for approval. The plan had to be accompanied by a general statement setting out the way in which any views submitted by interested parties, the results of consultations with lower government bodies and the advice of the Planning Advisory Board had been taken into account (section2a(6)). 108.The Lower House was entitled to send the outline planning decision back to the ministers concerned for modification before deciding whether or not to approve it. Thereafter it could withhold its approval of all or part of the plan (section 2a(7)). 109.The Lower House then transmitted the outline planning decision, as approved by it, to the Upper House of Parliament. The latter House could decide to approve it or not, but could not amend it (section 2a(8)). If approved by the Upper House, the outline planning decision came into force (section 2a(7)). Once it was in force, the outline planning decision was published in the Official Bulletin and the local media (section 2a(9)). 110.Although there is no specific provision for any appeal to an administrative tribunal against an outline planning decision, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State held in its decision of 31 January 1997 – that is the decision on the appeals against the outline planning decision in the present case (see paragraphs 62-69 above) – that the decisive moment for lodging an appeal was when the ministers resubmitted the outline planning decision to the Lower House of Parliament after the latter had given them the opportunity to modify it (that is, for the purposes of the present case, Outline Planning Decision – Part 3A). 111.Since 1 January 1994 it is provided that, in so far as an outline planning decision contains policy decisions about major projects of national importance, all further planning relating to such projects is subject to the limitations set out in these policy decisions (section 39). 112.The Transport Infrastructure Planning Act, as in force since 1January 1994, requires the Minister for Transport and Communications to consult the local and regional authorities whose territories may be affected and, in the case of a railway project, the prospective exploiter of the railway before drawing up a draft routing decision (section 6). This draft is then transmitted to them, after which they have the opportunity to comment (sections 11(1), 12(1) and (2), and section 13). 113.The minister then draws up a final routing decision and may if necessary require the local and regional authorities to modify their own local and zoning plans (section 15(1)-(3)). The routing decision is transmitted to Parliament with an explanatory statement (section 16(1)). Non-binding time-limits are set for the various stages of the procedure. 114.Anyone with an interest may lodge an appeal against the routing decision with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (section 15(4)). 115.Chapter V of the Transport Infrastructure Planning Act contains special provisions governing the procedure relating to major projects of national importance. This procedure is to be followed if an outline planning decision is in force (section 21). In such cases the outline planning decision is to form the basis of, and be transformed into, a draft routing decision (section 22). If changes to the draft routing decision appear necessary in view of observations received from interested parties or local-government bodies, then these changes are to remain within the limits drawn by the outline planning decision (section 23(1)). 116.The Minister for Transport and Communications, together with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Environment Management, then draws up a final routing decision and may, if necessary, require the local and regional authorities to modify their own local and zoning plans (section24(1)-(3)). 117.Anyone with an interest may appeal against the final routing decision to the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (section 24(4)). No separate appeal lies against the outline planning decision if it is followed within one year from its entry into force by a final routing decision (section 24(5)). 118.The Council of State was established by Emperor Charles V in 1531 in order to assist and advise his sister, Mary of Hungary, whom he had appointed regent (landvoogdes) of the Low Countries to rule on his behalf. 119.Following the Low Countries’ secession from in 1581 and in the course of the subsequent establishment of the independent Republic of the Seven United Netherlands Provinces, which was formalised in 1648 by the Treaty of Westphalia, the Council of State developed into a body that, together with the Stadtholder (Stadhouder), was charged with daily government. The control over their governance was exercised by the representatives of the United Provinces sitting in the States General (Staten-Generaal). 120.The Council of State was abolished in 1795, when occupied the Republic. Napoleon transformed the Republic into the in 1806 and, in 1810, incorporated it into the French Empire. In 1805 the Council of State had been reinstated as an advisory body to the Grand Pensionary (Raadpensionaris), who was appointed by the legislative body to head the then executive. The Council of State exercised this function until 1810. The Kingdom of the regained independence in 1813. According to the 1815 Netherlands Constitution (Grondwet), the monarch had an obligation to consult the Council of State before legislative acts and measures of internal administration were enacted. The monarch was further free to consult the Council of State on other matters. 121.A further function of the Council of State was introduced in 1861, namely that of hearing administrative disputes in which an appeal had been lodged with the Crown (Kroonberoep) and advising the Crown, consisting of the inviolable monarch and the responsible minister or ministers, on the ruling to be given by the Crown on the appeal. The Crown was free to depart from this advice. For the exercise of this function, the Administrative Litigation Division of the Council of State (Afdeling voor Geschillen van Bestuur van de Raad van State) was created. 122.On 1 July 1976 the Act on Administrative Jurisdiction as to Decisions of the Administration (Wet administrative rechtspraak overheidsbeschikkingen – “the AROB Act”) came into force, which provided for an administrative appeal procedure in statutorily defined categories of administrative disputes not eligible for an appeal to the Crown. The final decision on such disputes was to be taken by a newly established Division of the Council of State, that is the Judicial Division of the Council of State (Afdeling Rechtspraak van de Raad van State). 123.In order to give effect to the Court’s judgment of 23 October 1985 in Benthem v. the Netherlands (Series A no. 97), in which it was found that the Crown could not be regarded as a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the Interim Act on Crown Appeals (Tijdelijke Wet Kroongeschillen) was passed on 18 June 1987. It entered into force on 1January 1988 and was to remain in force for five years. Under the provisions of this Act, the Administrative Litigation Division of the Council of State was to determine all disputes which formerly were to be decided by the Crown. The function of the Judicial Division of the Council of State was not affected by this Act. 124.On 1 January 1994 the General Administrative Law Act (Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht), laying down new uniform rules of administrative procedure, entered into force. On the same date the Interim Act on Crown Appeals and the AROB Act were repealed. The functions of both the Administrative Litigation Division and the Judicial Division, which thereby became defunct, were vested in a new division of the Council of State, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division (Afdeling bestuursrechtspraak). 125.The Council of State is presided over by the monarch and consists of a vice-president and up to 28 ordinary councillors (Staatsraden) (section1 of the Council of State Act (Wet op de Raad van State)) and 55 extraordinary councillors (Staatsraden in buitengewone dienst) (section4, as worded since 1 April 2001; prior to this date the maximum number of extraordinary councillors was 25). At present, the Council of State is composed of 27 ordinary councillors and 27 extraordinary councillors. 126.All councillors are appointed by royal decree (Koninklijk Besluit) following nomination by the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations in agreement with the Minister for Justice. Appointments are for life, the age of retirement being 70 (sections 3 and 4). Extraordinary councillors submit proposals for the number of hours they wish to work, and their number is subsequently determined for five-year periods by royal decree. 127.Any candidate for membership of the Council of State is required to be a national and to be at least 35 years old (section 5). In the appointment of ordinary councillors, care is taken to ensure that the composition of the Plenary Council of State (Volle Raad), which solely consists of ordinary councillors, reflects political and social opinion in the proportions represented in the Houses of Parliament (Staten-Generaal). However, membership of a political party is not a formal or material criterion. 128.Ordinary councillors are appointed primarily on the basis of their knowledge and experience, whether in a specific field or in relation to public administration and administrative law in general. They are mainly selected from the circle of politicians, governors, high-level civil servants, judges and academics. Extraordinary councillors are mainly selected from the judiciary on the strength of their specific judicial knowledge and experience. 129.Section 7(1) of the Council of State Act sets out the posts, offices and professional activities that are incompatible with being vice-president of the Council of State and with being an ordinary councillor. These categories are extended in section 7(2) of this Act with regard to the extraordinary councillors. This provision reads: “The vice-president, ordinary councillors and extraordinary councillors shall not hold any post the exercise of which is undesirable with a view to the proper discharge of their office, the preservation of their impartiality and independence, or the confidence therein.” 130.Pursuant to section 7(3), the vice-president renders public any other positions held by members of the Council of State. This information is published in the Netherlands Government Gazette and posted on the Council of State’s official website. 131.As required by Article 73 of the Constitution, before the government submits to Parliament a bill for adoption, draft delegated legislation or a proposal to approve or denounce a treaty, it must seek the advisory opinion of the Council of State (section 15 of the Council of State Act). 132.In cases where proposed legislation does not originate from the government but from one or more members of the Lower House of Parliament, the Lower House will seek the advisory opinion of the Council of State (Article 15a). 133.For the purposes of delivering advisory opinions, the ordinary councillors are divided into five Sections, grouped by ministries. A bill is first scrutinised by officials, who set out their findings in a memorandum. The bill and this memorandum are subsequently transmitted to a rapporteur, who prepares a draft advisory opinion. This draft is then discussed in the Section concerned. It will subsequently be submitted to the Plenary Council of State for examination and adoption. 134.The Council of State examines draft legislation and explanatory memoranda in the light of a large number of criteria bearing on policy, points of law and technical legislative requirements. These criteria include compatibility with human rights conventions, European law, the Constitution, the Charter for the Kingdom of the (Statuut voor het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden), general legislation and unwritten legal principles, as well as existing law and general regulations on the structure, formulation and presentation of bills and explanatory memoranda. It further examines the anticipated effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility and enforceability of the proposed regulations, the degree of compliance to be expected, as well as the internal consistency of the legislation, the legal certainty it provides and the quality of legal protection. 135.The Plenary Council of State, which is composed solely of the ordinary councillors, adopts the advisory opinions of the Council of State. The extraordinary councillors are not involved in the advisory function of the Council of State. It is further standing practice that the meetings of the Plenary Council of State are not attended by the extraordinary councillors. 136.The Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State is entrusted with adjudicating administrative disputes, including applications for provisional relief, where the law so provides (section 26 of the Council of State Act). Its cases are heard in accordance with the provisions of the General Administrative Law Act and the relevant provisions of the Council of State Act. 137.The Administrative Jurisdiction Division consists of all the ordinary councillors of the Council of State (not its vice-president) and all the extraordinary councillors. They all hold this position for life until their retirement at the age of 70. Among them a president of the Division is appointed by royal decree, also for life. 138.The president manages the work of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division and decides on the composition of its four Chambers. The first Chamber deals with cases involving town and country planning, the second Chamber with environment cases, the third Chamber with general appeals and the fourth Chamber with appeals in cases concerning aliens. The first two Chambers administer justice at first and sole instance, whereas the third and fourth Chambers hear appeals against judgments given by lower administrative courts. Cases before the Administrative Jurisdiction Division are dealt with by either a three-judge bench or a single judge. 139.With a view to guaranteeing the impartial administration of justice, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division has adopted certain principles, namely that a member who has been involved in an application for provisional relief will not be involved in hearing the proceedings on the merits; if an appeal is dealt with in simplified proceedings (that is without an oral hearing), any objection (verzet) will not be heard by the member who gave the original judgment, and every member must be alert to any conflict of interest and, in case of any reasonable doubts, either withdraw from a case or acquiesce in a challenge to his or her impartiality. 140.Partly to facilitate this, and well in advance of hearings, members of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division assigned to a particular case are sent copies of the principal documents in the case, together with a list of parties involved and their legal counsel. In this way, each member can verify whether there are reasons for withdrawing from the case on grounds of, for instance, a previous position, kinship or any other relation between a member of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division and a party or legal representative. 141.From the above description it follows that some members of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division combine the judicial function with the advisory function, namely the ordinary councillors of the Council of State, while the extraordinary councillors perform only a judicial function within the Council of State. 142.In a memorandum appended to a letter dated 12 February 1998 to the Chairman of the Lower House, the Minister for Justice and the Minister of the Interior informed the Lower House that, in view of Procola (Series A no. 326) and given the fact that there was not yet communis opinio about its precise scope and its possible consequences for the Netherlands, the Council of State had adopted a provisional practice in anticipation of further clarification by the European Court of Human Rights in its future case-law (Lower House parliamentary documents 1997-98, 25 425, no. 3). 143.The dual function of the Council of State was subsequently debated at length in Parliament, which accepted the position taken by the government. 144.In parliamentary budget discussions held in 2000, the government confirmed its above position. In reply to a question put in the Lower House on the advisory and judicial functions of the Council of State in relation to the independence of the administration of justice, the government stated that, after Procola, the Council of State had adapted its internal working methods and that, referring to the contents of the Minister for Justice’s letter of 12 February 1998, these adaptations were of such a nature that so-called “Procola risks” were as good as excluded and that in this light the independent administration of justice was guaranteed (Lower House parliamentary documents 2000-01, 27 400 II, no. 3). 145.The practice adopted by the Council of State was further set out in the Annual Report 2000 of the Council of State. The relevant section reads as follows: “Since it is as yet unclear how the European Court of Human Rights will decide on the combination of functions within the Netherlands Council of State and the effect thereof on objective independence and impartiality, or what criteria the European Court of Human Rights will apply in this respect and what boundaries will be drawn, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division has for the time being chosen criteria and determined boundaries itself. Also, the Council of State and its Administrative Jurisdiction Division consider it important that justice is also seen to be done. The procedure opted for in this connection, and about which the Ministers for Justice and of the Interior have already made announcements to the Lower House (Lower House parliamentary documents 1997-98, 25 425, no. 3), amounts to the following: If in an appeal which has been lodged in time with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division, the lawfulness is disputed of a legal provision which has previously been applied in the case or of another regulation concerning an aspect – for example incompatibility with European law – in respect of which the Council of State has in the past explicitly expressed an opinion in its advice on the proposed provision, and if a party has voiced doubts as to the independence and impartiality of the bench dealing with the appeal, the composition of this bench will be changed so as to ensure that only members who have not participated in the advice sit on this bench. For this are in any event eligible the extraordinary councillors, who are not involved in the advisory function, and those ordinary councillors appointed after the giving of the advice and those ordinary councillors in respect of whom it is objectively certain that they have not participated in the adoption of the advice in the Plenary Council of State. In such a situation, this will – thanks to this way of proceeding in the Division – therefore prevent appellants as far as possible from relying on Procola in a challenge or otherwise.” 146.Members of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division to whom a case has been assigned may be challenged by any of the parties on the grounds of facts or circumstances which may affect their judicial impartiality (section 8(15) of the General Administrative Law Act taken together with section 36 of the Council of State Act). 147.The challenge will be examined as soon as possible by a Chamber composed of three members of the Council of State, which shall not include the councillor(s) challenged. The challenging party and the councillor(s) challenged are offered the opportunity to be heard. A reasoned decision shall be given as soon as possible, against which no appeal lies (section8(18) of the General Administrative Law Act taken together with section 36 of the Council of State Act). 148.In the case-law developed by the Administrative Jurisdiction Division in relation to challenges based on the Council of State’s combined advisory and judicial functions in the light of Article 6 of the Convention, decisive importance is attached to the question whether or not the challenged councillor was involved in advising on the disputed legislation and whether the substance of the appeal concerns a point that was explicitly addressed in the advisory opinion given by the Council of State. 149.The Administrative Jurisdiction Division initially took as one of its criteria the degree to which members of the bench hearing the appeal had contributed to the advisory opinion. This criterion was dropped in later caselaw, as this information is not accessible to the general public and therefore the parties. The key questions remain whether the challenged member of the bench belonged to the Plenary Council of State at the time when the advisory opinion was given and whether any position was adopted in the advisory opinion that is opposed by the party that has lodged the challenge. Only in cases where these questions can be answered in the affirmative is it accepted that a party has justified grounds to fear that the councillor concerned is biased in respect of the subject of the dispute (see Administrative Jurisdiction Division, case no. E10.95.0026/W, judgment of 9 October 1997, and case no. EO1.96.0532/W, judgment of 10 December 1997, Jurisprudentie Bestuursrecht 1998/28). 150.The rejection of a challenge does not however preclude the possibility that members of the bench concerned subsequently decide to withdraw from the case in view of the substance of the appeal (see Administrative Jurisdiction Division, case no. E03.96.0765/1, Jurisprudentie Bestuursrecht 2001/72). 151.Since Procola was published, it has been relied on in ten challenges lodged before the Administrative Jurisdiction Division. All of these challenges have been rejected, either because members assigned to the appeal were not involved in the previous advisory opinions on the statutory provisions concerned, or because the points of law put to the Administrative Jurisdiction Division by the party having lodged the challenge were so remote from the previous advisory opinion that the fear of bias was found to be unjustified. 152.In an appeal in cassation lodged with the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad) against a judgment of 29 March 1999 of the Arnhem Regional Court (Arrondissementsrechtbank) in expropriation proceedings in connection with the construction of the Betuweroute railway, the appellant argued that the Regional Court, by confining itself to referring to the administrative procedures already pursued before the Administrative Jurisdiction Division, had neglected to rule on the legality and necessity of the expropriation and, in particular, that the Regional Court had failed to investigate technical alternatives such as tunnelling, which would make expropriation unnecessary. In this connection, referring to the Court’s judgment in Procola (cited above), he argued that the Council of State’s “structural impartiality” was in doubt and that it followed from this that he was entitled to have these issues reviewed by the ordinary courts. 153.In its judgment of 16 February 2000, the Supreme Court rejected these arguments. It agreed with the that issues such as the necessity of building the railway at all and the choice of technical and routing alternatives were matters to be dealt with in administrative proceedings under the Town and Country Planning Act and the Transport Infrastructure Planning Act and not in expropriation proceedings. As to the appellant’s point concerning the impartiality of the Council of State, the Supreme Court held as follows: “3.2.[The appellant] has submitted before the Regional Court – in so far as still relevant – in objection to the expropriation: ... (b)As the Council of State (as a whole, therefore including the Administrative Jurisdiction Division) has been involved in the enactment of the Transport Infrastructure Planning Act and in this respect, as an advisory organ, has issued a generally positive advice, the Council of State cannot be regarded as a structurally impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention; ...",2003,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT
1.  DECLARES UNANIMOUSLY THE REMAINDER OF EACH APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE;
2.  HOLDS BY TWELVE VOTES TO FIVE THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION;
"
29,001-59455,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicants are four full siblings: –Z, a girl born in 1982; –A, a boy born in 1984; –B, a boy born in 1986; –C, a girl born in 1988. 10.The applicants' parents were married in November 1981. 11.The family was first referred to social services in October 1987 by their health visitor due to concerns about the children and marital problems. Z was reported to be stealing food at night. Following the referral, a professionals' meeting, involving the relevant agencies, was held on 24November 1987, at which it was decided that a social worker and health visitor should visit. The family were reviewed at a further meeting in March 1988 and as it appeared that concerns had diminished, the file was closed. 12.In September 1988 a neighbour reported that the children were locked outside the house for most of the day. 13.In April 1989 the police reported that the children's bedrooms were filthy. The family's general practitioner also reported that the children's bedrooms were filthy and that their doors were locked. The children's head-teacher, Mrs Armstrong, expressed concern in May 1989 and requested a case conference. In June 1989 the NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) and the emergency team made a referral after complaints by neighbours that the house was filthy and that the children spent most of the day in their bedrooms, rarely being allowed out to play, and crying frequently. In August 1989 the maternal grandmother complained to the social services about the mother's care and discipline of the children. 14.At a professionals' meeting on 4 October 1989, at which the social services, the applicants' head-teacher, the applicants' general practitioner and health visitor attended, it was decided that no social worker would be allocated to the family. The school was to monitor the older children's weight and the health visitor was to continue to visit the family regularly. It was agreed that the problem was one of limited and neglectful parenting rather than a risk of physical abuse, and that the parents should be assisted to manage their responsibilities better. 15.In October 1989, whilst the applicants were on holiday, their house was burgled. On entering, the police found it in a filthy state. Used sanitary towels and dirty nappies were discarded in a cupboard and the children's mattresses were sodden with urine. At a professionals' meeting on 13 December 1989, the health visitor requested that the four older children be placed on the Child Protection Register as she felt that their mother could not offer consistent care. This suggestion was rejected. However, a social-work assistant, Ms M., was assigned to the family. It was not considered appropriate to convene a case conference at this stage. Prior to the meeting, Z and A had mentioned to the head-teacher that A had been hit with a poker. It was decided that this statement would be investigated. 16.At a professionals' meeting on 23 March 1990, an improvement was noted in respect of the cleanliness of the house, the children's bedding being clean save on two occasions. However, it was reported that Z and A were taking food from bins at the school. There was still considered to be cause for concern, especially since the birth of another child was expected. 17.At a professionals' meeting on 11 July 1990, the applicants' headmistress reported a deterioration in the children's well-being; Z and A were still taking food from bins and A was soiling himself. Ms M. was visiting weekly at this stage and said that she was checking the children's bedrooms. She had noted that the children ate at 4 or 4.30 p.m. and then did not eat again until the morning. The children were also sent to bed at 6 p.m. It was planned to give the applicant's mother further assistance through a voluntary agency. 18.In or about September 1990, A and B were both reported to have bruising on their faces. The police investigated after neighbours had reported screaming at the applicants' home but apparently found no signs of bruising. They reported to the social services that “the conditions of the house were appalling and not fit for [the] children to live in”. 19.At a further professionals' meeting on 3 October 1990, the assistant social worker, Ms M., stated that she was concerned about the applicants' soiling and their mother's lack of interest. Apparently, the children were defecating in their bedroom and smearing excrement on their windows. The head-teacher expressed concern, particularly concerning the boys A and B, and stated that the children had described blocks of wood being placed against their bedroom doors. It was decided to continue monitoring the children. 20.At a professionals' meeting on 5 December 1990, a decision was made to arrange a case conference for January 1991 as a result of concern regarding the applicants' care and the state of their bedroom. Ms M. considered that standards in the boys' bedroom had dramatically dropped. She found the room to be damp and smelly. A's bed was broken and had a metal bar protruding from it. The bedding was damp and grubby with soil marks. 21.In a report dated 24 January 1991, the headmistress stated that A was shabby, ill-kempt and often dirty and that he had been raiding the playground bins for apple cores. Z was pathetic, lacking in vitality and frequently and inexplicably tearful, becoming increasingly isolated from the other girls in her peer group with unfortunate incidents in which detrimental remarks were made about her appearance. B presented as withdrawn, pathetic and bedraggled. He regularly arrived cold, was frequently tearful and craved physical contact from adult helpers. He also appeared to crave for food. She concluded that they were still concerned that the children's needs were not being adequately met and that home conditions and family dynamics were giving reasons for concern. 22.At the case conference held on 28 January 1991, Ms M. stated that the boys' bedroom had no light, carpet or toys and that their bedding was wet, smelly and soil-stained. Their mother did not change the beds. Their head-teacher stated that Z was tearful and withdrawn, A had been raiding school bins and was often dirty, and B was very withdrawn, craved attention and was ravenously hungry. The chairman of the conference concluded that, despite the many concerns about the parenting of the applicants and the conditions in the home, there was little evidence to support going to court. It was felt that the parents were not wilfully neglecting their children and, bearing in mind their own poor upbringing, it was considered that the applicants' parents were doing what they could and that continued support was required to try and improve the situation. It was decided not to place the children on the Child Protection Register. 23.On 5 March 1991 B was found to have “unusual” bruises on his back. 24.At a later social services meeting in April 1991, no change to the children's living conditions was noted. The head-teacher stated that Z and A were still taking food from bins and that A was becoming more withdrawn. Ms M. reported that the mother had stated that the children were taking food from the park bins on the way to school. 25.In July 1991 the applicants' mother informed social services that the children would be better off living in care. On 12 August 1991 the social services received a phone call from a neighbour who stated that the children were frequently locked outside in a filthy back garden, that they constantly screamed and that they were kept for long periods in their bedrooms where they smeared faeces on their windows. The maternal grandparents later told the guardian ad litem that Z, who was treated by her mother as a little servant, was expected to clean the excrement from the windows. 26.From 19 to 28 August 1991, the three older children spent some time with foster carers in respite care. The foster carers reported that A did not know how to wash, bathe or clean his teeth on arrival. He wet his bed every night and stole food from his brother. B was described as being “very frightened. He could not understand how he could play in the garden and the door was left open for him to come back in, he expected to be locked out”. He also had to be taught to use the toilet properly and to clean himself. 27.At a professionals' meeting on 18 September 1991, Ms M. stated that the conditions in which the boys were sleeping were deteriorating. The mattresses in the boys' bedroom were ripped and the springs were coming through. The boys were stealing food, and C had also been seen to do this. Their mother stated that she could not control them. It was decided not to arrange a child-protection meeting but to carry out a monthly weight check on the three older children at school, and for the health visitor to check the weight of the two younger children. It was also decided to arrange respite care for Z, A and B in the holidays as well as on one weekend in four. 28.In November-December 1991 C was found to have developed a squint. His mother failed to keep appointments at the eye-clinic over the following months. 29.At a professionals' meeting on 21 November 1991, it was reported that the applicants' mother had said that she could not control the applicants' behaviour which consisted of refusing to go to bed when asked and stealing food. It was considered that the home was in an acceptable condition, though the boys' room still needed attention. The children's weights were recorded. It was noted that Z had put on 2 lb in the previous two months whereas she had only put on 2.5 lb in the preceding two years. A had only put on 3 lb in a year. B had put on 0.5 lb in a year and was on the 50th centile for height. C was on the 25th centile for weight. There was a discussion about the three elder children being accommodated by the local authority to allow the mother “to get back on her feet”. The social services considered a six-week period whilst the general practitioner envisaged a period of eighteen to twenty-four months. 30.In December 1991 a social worker was introduced to the applicants' mother with a view to assisting her with shopping, budgeting and cooking. 31.Z, A and B were accommodated by volunteers between January and March 1992, and showed to have gained weight. In March and again in April, their mother asked if the boys, A and B, could be placed for adoption. 32.On 14 January 1992 C started to attend a nursery group at a family centre. She was noted to be unsocialised, lacking in confidence, unable to share, and with poor speech. 33.At a further professionals' meeting on 9 March 1992, it was decided that further respite care would be considered. The children's weights were noted, increases being seen for Z, A and B. 34.The children's parents divorced in April 1992. 35.At another professionals' meeting on 30 April 1992 it was decided that the applicants' mother's request that A and B be placed for adoption be followed up. The headmistress voiced concern over the fundamental pattern of the mother's care of the children, in particular in relation to Z's role in the home and the mothering role which she played. Ms M. reported that conditions were deteriorating for A and B. 36.On 10 June 1992 the applicants' mother demanded that the children be placed in care as she could not cope. She stated that if they were not removed from her care she would batter them. The applicants were placed in emergency foster care. The applicants were entered onto the Child Protection Register under the categories of neglect and emotional abuse after a child-protection meeting on 22 June 1992. 37.The applicants were all fostered separately. Initially, Z was noted to have dirty, ill-fitting clothes. She stated that she did not like living with her siblings as she did not like having to look after them all the time. A wet the bed every night, shunned physical contact and suffered from nightmares. B did not know how to use the toilet or toilet paper. C bonded very quickly with her foster parents. 38.On 8 October 1992 the local authority decided to seek care orders in respect of the children. Interim care orders were made on 7 December 1992. 39.A guardian ad litem, who was appointed on 18 January 1993, recommended that all the applicants should be the subject of care orders in order to protect them from further harm. She stated that there was “an abundance of evidence that the children have been subjected to physical and mental ill-treatment”. She noted that their health had also been neglected by their parents who frequently missed appointments with opticians and doctors. 40.All the applicants were seen by Dr Dora Black, a consultant child psychiatrist, in January 1993. Dr Black stated that the three older children were all showing signs of psychological disturbance. Z was exhibiting signs of serious depressive illness and had assumed responsibility for her family and for its breakdown. Her mother's behaviour towards her was described as cruel and emotionally abusive. A and B, who suffered from nightmares, were both identified as showing signs of post-traumatic stress disorder and A was also chronically under-attached. Dr Black noted that all children had been deprived of affection and physical care. She described their experiences as “to put it bluntly, horrific”, and added that the case was the worst case of neglect and emotional abuse that she had seen in her professional career. In her opinion, social services had “leaned over backwards to avoid putting these children on the Child Protection Register and had delayed too long, leaving at least three of the children with serious psychological disturbance as a result”. 41.Full care orders were made in respect of the applicants on 14 April 1993 by Judge Tyrer sitting at Milton Keynes County Court. 42.In June 1993 the Official Solicitor, acting as the applicants' next friend, commenced proceedings against the local authority claiming damages for negligence and/or breach of statutory duty arguing that the authority had failed to have regard to their welfare as was required by statute and should have acted more quickly and more effectively when apprised of their condition. It was argued that the local authority's failure to act had resulted in psychological damage. The application was struck out as revealing no cause of action, by Mr Justice Turner on 12 November 1993. 43.The applicants appealed to the Court of Appeal, which, on 28 February 1994, upheld the decision of Mr Justice Turner to strike out the application. 44.The applicants appealed to the House of Lords. On 29 June 1995 the House of Lords rejected their appeal, finding that no action lay against the local authority in negligence or breach of statutory duty concerning the discharge of their duties relating to the welfare of children under the Children Act 1989 in respect of child care. The case is reported as X and Others v. Bedfordshire County Council [1995] 3 All England Law Reports 353. 45.Lord Browne-Wilkinson gave the leading judgment. In respect of claims for breach of statutory duty, he stated, inter alia: “... My starting point is that the Acts in question are all concerned to establish an administrative system designed to promote the social welfare of the community. The welfare sector involved is one of peculiar sensitivity, involving very difficult decisions how to strike the balance between protecting the child from immediate feared harm and disrupting the relationship between the child and its parents. In my judgment in such a context it would require exceptionally clear statutory language to show a parliamentary intention that those responsible for carrying out these difficult functions should be liable in damages if, on subsequent investigation with the benefit of hindsight, it was shown that they had reached an erroneous conclusion and therefore failed to discharge their statutory duties. ... When one turns to the actual words used in the primary legislation to create the duties relied upon in my judgment they are inconsistent with any intention to create a private law cause of action.” 46.As regards the claims that the local authority owed a duty of care to the applicants pursuant to the tort of negligence, Lord Browne-Wilkinson stated, inter alia: “I turn then to consider whether, in accordance with the ordinary principles laid down in Caparo [1990] 2 AC 605, the local authority ... owed a direct duty of care to the plaintiffs. The local authority accepts that they could foresee damage to the plaintiffs if they carried out their statutory duties negligently and that the relationship between the authority and the plaintiffs is sufficiently proximate. The third requirement laid down in Caparo is that it must be just and reasonable to impose a common law duty of care in all the circumstances ... The Master of the Rolls took the view, with which I agree, that the public policy consideration that has first claim on the loyalty of the law is that wrongs should be remedied and that very potent counter considerations are required to override that policy (see [1994] 4 AER 602 at 619). However, in my judgment there are such considerations in this case. First, in my judgment a common law duty of care would cut across the whole statutory system set up for the protection of children at risk. As a result of the ministerial directions contained in 'Working Together' the protection of such children is not the exclusive territory of the local authority's social services. The system is inter-disciplinary, involving the participation of the police, educational bodies, doctors and others. At all stages the system involves joint discussions, joint recommendations and joint decisions. The key organisation is the Child Protection Conference, a multi-disciplinary body which decides whether to place the child on the Child Protection Register. This procedure by way of joint action takes place, not merely because it is good practice, but because it is required by guidance having statutory force binding on the local authority. The guidance is extremely detailed and extensive: the current edition of 'Working Together' runs to 126 pages. To introduce into such a system a common law duty of care enforceable against only one of the participant bodies would be manifestly unfair. To impose such liability on all the participant bodies would lead to almost impossible problems of disentangling as between the respective bodies the liability, both primary and by way of contribution, of each for reaching a decision found to be negligent. Second, the task of the local authority and its servants in dealing with children at risk is extraordinarily delicate. Legislation requires the local authority to have regard not only to the physical well-being of the child but also to the advantages of not disrupting the child's family environment. ... In one of the child abuse cases, the local authority is blamed for removing the child precipitately; in the other for failing to remove the children from their mother. As the Report of the Inquiry into Child Abuse in Cleveland 1987 (Cmnd. 412) ('Cleveland Report 1987') said, at p. 244: '... It is a delicate and difficult line to tread between taking action too soon and not taking it soon enough. Social services whilst putting the needs of the child first must respect the rights of the parents; they also must work if possible with the parents for the benefit of the children. These parents themselves are often in need of help. Inevitably a degree of conflict develops between those objectives.' Next, if liability in damages were to be imposed, it might well be that local authorities would adopt a more cautious and defensive approach to their duties. For example, as the Cleveland Report makes clear, on occasions the speedy decision to remove the child is sometimes vital. If the authority is to be made liable in damages for a negligent decision to remove a child (such negligence lying in the failure properly first to investigate the allegations) there would be a substantial temptation to postpone making such a decision until further inquiries have been made in the hope of getting more concrete facts. Not only would the child in fact being abused be prejudiced by such delay, the increased workload inherent in making such investigations would reduce the time available to deal with other cases and other children. The relationship between the social worker and the child's parents is frequently one of conflict, the parent wishing to retain care of the child, the social worker having to consider whether to remove it. This is fertile ground in which to breed ill-feeling and litigation, often hopeless, the cost of which both in terms of money and human resources will be diverted from the performance of the social service for which they were provided. The spectre of vexatious and costly litigation is often urged as a reason for not imposing a legal duty. But the circumstances surrounding cases of child abuse make the risk a very high one which cannot be ignored. If there were no other remedy for maladministration of the statutory system for the protection of children, it would provide substantial argument for imposing a duty of care. But the statutory complaints procedures contained in section 76 of the 1980 Act and the much fuller procedures now available under the 1989 Act provide a means to have grievances investigated though not to recover compensation. Further, it was submitted (and not controverted) that the local authorities Ombudsman would have power to investigate cases such as these. Finally, your Lordships' decision in Caparo [1990] 2 AC 605 lays down that in deciding whether to develop novel categories of negligence the court should proceed incrementally and by analogy with decided categories. We were not referred to any category of case in which a duty of care has been held to exist which is in any way analogous to the present cases. Here, for the first time, the plaintiffs are seeking to erect a common law duty of care in relation to the administration of a statutory social welfare scheme. Such a scheme is designed to protect weaker members of society (children) from harm done to them by others. The scheme involves the administrators in exercising discretion and powers which could not exist in the private sector and which in many cases bring them into conflict with those who, under the general law, are responsible for the child's welfare. To my mind, the nearest analogies are the cases where a common law duty of care has been sought to be imposed upon the police (in seeking to protect vulnerable members of society from wrongs done to them by others) or statutory regulators of financial dealing who are seeking to protect investors from dishonesty. In neither of these cases has it been thought appropriate to superimpose on a statutory regime a common law duty of care giving rise to a claim in damages for failure to protect the weak against the wrongdoer. ... In my judgment, the courts should proceed with great care before holding liable in negligence those who have been charged by Parliament with the task of protecting society from the wrong doings of others.” 47.Z and C, the two girls, were meanwhile adopted. The boys, A and B, were initially in foster care. Following the breakdown of B's adoptive placement, he was placed in a therapeutic residential placement in July 1995. After two years, he was again placed with foster parents where he remained, attending school in a special-needs group. In January 1996, A was placed in a therapeutic community, where he stayed for two years. He apparently had a number of foster placements which broke down. Records indicated that he had been in twelve different placements in eight years. He is currently in a children's home. 48.In March 1996, applications were made to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (CICB) on behalf of all the children by the adoption society to whom the local authority had delegated certain responsibilities. It was claimed on behalf of Z that she had suffered severe neglect and chronic deprivation which rendered it likely that specialist care would be necessary during her adolescence, a time where emotional repercussions of the abuse might become apparent; on behalf of A that he had suffered physical deprivation, emotional abuse, physical abuse and possible sexual abuse – he had suffered permanent physical scarring and was still receiving treatment from a child psychiatrist; on behalf of B that he had suffered extreme physical and emotional deprivation and shown signs of sexual abuse – he also had suffered permanent physical scarring and was receiving therapy; and on behalf of C that she had suffered extreme physical and emotional deprivation, and in addition that her need for eye treatment was not being met by her parents. 49.In February 1997, the CICB awarded 1,000 pounds sterling (GBP) to Z, GBP 3,000 to A and GBP 3,000 to B for injuries suffered between 1987 and 1992; it awarded GBP 2,000 to C for injuries suffered between 1988 and 1992. In a letter dated 20 May 1998 from the CICB to the Official Solicitor, it was stated: “The Board Member who assessed these cases recognised that the children were exposed to appalling neglect over an extended period but explained to their advisers that the Board could not make an award unless it was satisfied on the whole available evidence that an applicant had suffered an injury – physical or psychological – directly attributable to a crime of violence ... He was nevertheless satisfied, that setting aside 'neglect' the children had some physical and psychological injury inflicted upon them as enabled him to make an award to each child ...” 50.Prior to the coming into force of the current legislation, the Children Act 1989, on 14 October 1991, the local authority's duty in respect of child care was governed by the Child Care Act 1980. Sections 1 and 2 of the Child Care Act 1980 provided that: “1.It shall be the duty of every local authority to make available such advice, guidance and assistance as may promote the welfare of children by diminishing the need to receive or keep them in care.>(1)Where it appears to a local authority with respect to a child in their area appearing to them to be under the age of seventeen - (a)that he has neither parent nor guardian or has been and remains abandoned by his parents or guardian or is lost; (b)that his parents or guardian are, for the time being or permanently, prevented by reason of mental or bodily disease or infirmity or other incapacity or any other circumstances from providing for his proper accommodation, maintenance and upbringing; and (c)in either case, that the intervention of the local authority under this section is necessary in the interests of the welfare of the child, it shall be the duty of the local authority to receive the child into their care under this section.” 51.Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 has since provided, inter alia: “17.Provision of services for children in need, their families and others (1)It shall be the general duty of every local authority (in addition to the other duties imposed on them by this Part) - (a)to safeguard and promote the welfare of children within their area who are in need; and (b)so far as is consistent with that duty, to promote the upbringing of such children by their families, by providing a range and level of services appropriate to those children's needs. (2)For the purpose principally of facilitating the discharge of their general duty under this section, every local authority shall have the specific duties and powers set out in Part I of Schedule 2. ... (10)For the purposes of this Part a child shall be taken to be in need if - (a)he is unlikely to achieve or maintain, or to have the opportunity of achieving or maintaining a reasonable standard of health or development without the provision for him of services by a local authority under this Part; (b)his health or development is likely to be significantly impaired or further impaired, without the provision for him of such services; or (c)he is disabled ... (11)...; and in this Part 'development' means physical, intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural development; and 'health' means physical or mental health.” 52.Part III of the Children Act 1989 deals with local authority support for children and families. The policy of the Act is made clear by paragraph7 of Part I of Schedule 2, which requires local authorities to take reasonable steps designed to reduce the need to bring proceedings relating to children. 53.Section 20 provides that “20(1)Every local authority shall provide accommodation for any child in need within their area who appears to them to require accommodation as a result of - (a)there being no person who has parental responsibility for him; (b)his being lost or having been abandoned; or (c)the person who has been caring for him being prevented (whether or not permanently, and for whatever reason) from providing him with suitable accommodation or care. ... (4)A local authority may provide accommodation for any child within their area (even though a person who has parental responsibility for him is able to provide him with accommodation) if they consider that to do so would safeguard or promote the child's welfare.” 54.Part V of the Children Act 1989 deals with the protection of children. Section 47 provides as follows: “47(1)Where a local authority - ... (b)have reasonable cause to suspect that a child who lives or is found, in their area is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm, the authority shall make, or cause to be made, such enquiries as they consider necessary to enable them to decide whether they should take any action to safeguard or promote the child's welfare. ... (8)Where, as a result of complying with this section, a local authority conclude that they should take action to safeguard or promote the child's welfare they shall take action (so far as it is within their power and reasonably practicable for them to do so).” 55.The complaints procedure is provided by section 26 of the Children Act 1989: “Review of cases and inquiries into representations ... (3)Every local authority shall establish a procedure for considering any representations (including any complaint) made to them by - (a)any child ... who is not being looked after by them but is in need; (b)a parent of his; ... (e)such other person as the authority consider has a sufficient interest in the child's welfare to warrant his representations being considered by them, about the discharge by the authority of any of their functions under this Part in relation to the child. (4)The procedure shall ensure that at least one person who is not a member or officer of the authority takes part in - (a)the consideration; and (b)any discussions which are held by the local authority about the action (if any) to be taken in relation to the child in the light of this consideration. ... (7)Where any representation has been considered under the procedure established by the local authority under this section, the authority shall - (a)have due regard to the findings of those considering the representation; and (b)take such steps as are reasonably practicable to notify (in writing) - (i)the person making the representation; (ii)the child (if the authority consider that he has sufficient understanding); and (iii)such other persons (if any) as appear to the authority to be likely to be affected, of the authority's decision in the matter and their reasons for taking that decision and of any action which they have taken, or propose to take. (8)Every local authority shall give such publicity to their procedure for considering representations under this section as they consider appropriate.” 56.The powers of the Secretary of State to investigate the actions of the local authority are set out in sections 81 and 84 of the Children Act 1989. “81.(1)The Secretary of State may cause an inquiry to be held into any matter connected with - (a)the function of the social services committee of a local authority, in so far as those functions relate to children; ... 84.Local authority failure to comply with statutory duty: default power of Secretary of State (1)If the Secretary of State is satisfied that any local authority has failed, without reasonable excuse, to comply with any of the duties imposed on them by or under this Act he may make an order declaring that authority to be in default with respect to that duty. ... (3)Any order under subsection (1) may contain such directions for the purpose of ensuring that the duty is complied with, within such period as may be specified in the order, as appears to the Secretary of State to be necessary. (4)Any such directions shall, on the application of the Secretary of State, be enforceable by mandamus.” 57.In England and Wales there is no single tort which imposes liability to pay compensation for civil wrongs. Instead there is a series of separate torts, for example, trespass, conversion, conspiracy, negligence and defamation. 58.Negligence arises in specific categories of situations. These categories are capable of being extended. There are three elements to the tort of negligence: a duty of care, breach of the duty of care, and damage. The duty of care may be described as the concept which defines the categories of relationships in which the law may impose liability on a defendant in damages if he or she is shown to have acted carelessly. To show a duty of care, the claimant must show that the situation comes within an existing established category of cases where a duty of care has been held to exist. In novel situations, in order to show a duty of care, the claimant must satisfy a threefold test, establishing: –that damage to the claimant was foreseeable; –that the claimant was in an appropriate relationship of proximity to the defendant; and, –that it is fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant. These criteria apply to claims against private persons as well as claims against public bodies. The leading case is Caparo Industries plc v. Dickman ([1990] 2 Appeal Cases 605). 59.If the courts decide that as a matter of law there is no duty of care owed in a particular situation, that decision will (subject to the doctrine of precedent) apply in future cases where the parties are in the same relationship. 60.The decision in X and Others v. Bedfordshire County Council ([1995] 3 All England Law Reports 353) is the leading authority in the United Kingdom in this area. It held that local authorities could not be sued for negligence or for breach of statutory duty in respect of the discharge of their functions concerning the welfare of children. The leading judgment is reported at length in the facts above (see paragraphs 45-46 above). 61.Since X and Others v. Bedfordshire County Council, there have been two further significant judgments regarding the extent of liability of local authorities in child care matters. 62.The Court of Appeal gave judgment in W. and Others v. Essex County Council ([1998] 3 All England Law Reports 111). This case concerned the claims by a mother and father (first and second plaintiffs), who had agreed to act as foster parents, that the defendant local authority placed G., a 15-year-old boy, in their home although they knew that he was a suspect or known sexual abuser. During G.'s stay in their home, the plaintiffs' three children (fourth to sixth plaintiffs) were all sexually abused and suffered psychiatric illness. The plaintiffs brought an action against the local authority and the social worker involved, claiming damages for negligence and for negligent misstatement. On the defendants' application to strike out the statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, the judges struck out the parents' claims but refused to strike out the claims of the children. The Court of Appeal upheld his decision. The headnote for the judgment summarised the Court of Appeal's findings as follows: “(1)Although no claim in damages lay in respect of decisions by a local authority in the exercise of a statutory discretion, if the decision complained of was so unreasonable that it fell outside the ambit of the discretion conferred, there was no a priori reason for excluding common law liability. In the instant case, the giving of information to the parents was part and parcel of the defendants' performance of their statutory powers and duties, and it had been conceded that it was arguable that those decisions fell outside the ambit of their discretion. Accordingly, since it had also been conceded that the damage to the children was reasonably foreseeable and that there was sufficient proximity, the question for the court was whether it was just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on the council or the social worker. Having regard to the fact that common law duty of care would cut across the whole statutory set up for the protection of children at risk, that the task of the local authority and its servants in dealing with such children was extraordinarily difficult and delicate, that local authorities might adopt a more defensive approach to their duties if liability in damages were imposed, that the relationship between parents and social workers was frequently one of conflict and that the plaintiff children's injuries were compensatable under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, it was not just and reasonable to do so. It followed that no duty of care was owed to the plaintiff parents who in any event were secondary victims in respect of their claim for psychiatric illness ... (2)(Stuart-Smith LJ dissenting) It was arguable that the policy considerations against imposing a common law duty of care on a local authority in relation to the performance of its statutory duties to protect children did not apply when the children whose safety was under consideration were those in respect of whom it was not performing any statutory duty. Accordingly, since in the instant case, the plaintiff children were not children for whom the council had carried out any immediate caring responsibilities under the child welfare system but were living at home with their parents, and express assurances had been given that a sexual abuser would not be placed in their home, their claim should proceed ...” 63.On further appeal by the parents, the House of Lords on 16 March 2000 held that it was impossible to say that the psychiatric injury allegedly suffered by the parents, flowing from a feeling that they had brought the abuser and their children together or from a feeling of responsibility for not having detected the abuse earlier, was outside the range of psychiatric injury recognised by the law, nor was it unarguable that the local authority had owed a duty of care to the parents. The parents' claim could not be said to be so certainly or clearly bad that they should be barred from pursuing it to trial and their appeal was allowed. 64.The House of Lords gave judgment on 17 June 1999 in Barrett v. London Borough of Enfield ([1999] 3 Weekly Law Reports 79). That case concerned the claims of the plaintiff, who had been in care from the age of ten months to 17 years, that the local authority had negligently failed to safeguard his welfare causing him deep-seated psychiatric problems. The local authority had applied to strike out the case as disclosing no cause of action. The House of Lords, upholding the plaintiff's appeal, unanimously held that the judgment in X and Others v. Bedfordshire County Council did not in the circumstances of this case prevent a claim of negligence being brought against a local authority by a child formerly in its care. 65.Lord Browne-Wilkinson, in his judgment in that case, commented as follows on the operation of the duty of care: “(1)Although the word 'immunity' is sometimes incorrectly used, a holding that it is not fair, just and reasonable to hold liable a particular class of defendants whether generally or in relation to a particular type of activity is not to give immunity from a liability to which the rest of the world is subject. It is a prerequisite to there being any liability in negligence at all that as a matter of policy it is fair, just and reasonable in those circumstances to impose liability in negligence. (2)In a wide range of cases public policy has led to the decision that the imposition of liability would not be fair and reasonable in the circumstances, e.g. some activities of financial regulators, building inspectors, ship surveyors, social workers dealing with sex abuse cases. In all these cases and many others the view has been taken that the proper performance of the defendant's primary functions for the benefit of society as a whole will be inhibited if they are required to look over their shoulder to avoid liability in negligence. In English law the decision as to whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a liability in negligence on a particular class of would-be defendants depends on weighing in the balance the total detriment to the public interest in all cases from holding such class liable in negligence as against the total loss to all would-be plaintiffs if they are not to have a cause of action in respect of the loss they have individually suffered. (3)In English law, questions of public policy and the question whether it is fair and reasonable to impose liability in negligence are decided as questions of law. Once the decision is taken that, say, company auditors though liable to shareholders for negligent auditing are not liable to those proposing to invest in the company (see Caparo Industries plc v. Dickman [1990] 1 All ER 568, [1990] 2 AC 605), that decision will apply to all future cases of the same kind. The decision does not depend on weighing the balance between the extent of the damage to the plaintiff and the damage to the public in each particular case.” 66.At the relevant time, Order 18, Rule 19 of the Rules of the Supreme Court provided that a claim could be struck out if it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. This jurisdiction has been described as being reserved for “plain and obvious cases”, in which a claim was “obviously unsustainable”. 67.In applications to strike out, the courts proceeded on the basis that all the allegations set out in the claimant's pleadings were true. The question for the courts was whether, assuming that the claimant could substantiate all factual allegations at trial, the claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. 68.The striking out procedure, now contained in Part 3.4(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules in force since 1999, is regarded as an important feature of English civil procedure, performing the function of securing speedy and effective justice, inter alia, by allowing a court to decide promptly which issues need full investigation and trial, and disposing summarily of the others. By means of this procedure, it can be determined at an early stage, with minimal cost to the parties, whether the facts as pleaded reveal a claim existing in law.",2001,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

19,001-58226,Grand Chamber,"7.Mr Pélissier was born in 1944 and lives at Sanary-sur-Mer; Mr Sassi was born in 1935 and lives at . Both are French nationals.>On 16 October 1975 Mr Fernand Cortez and Mr Claude Cortez formed a private limited company (société à responsabilité limitée – Sàrl), Bleu Marine, whose object was the sale of pleasure craft. Fernand Cortez was appointed manager. In 1976 Bleu Marine started to trade with a public company, Chantiers Beneteau S.A., whose object was boat-building. On 8October 1981, Bleu Marine became Chantiers Beneteau’s exclusive distributor for the Var département coast.>On 31 March 1980 both applicants became shareholders in Bleu Marine, each holding 250 of a total of 1,000 shares (the remaining 500 belonged to the promoters, Fernand and Claude Cortez). 10.On 29 September 1982 Fernand Cortez, the applicants and MrDominique Stizi formed a private limited company, Station Service du Bateau Sàrl, which was run by Fernand Cortez and Dominique Stizi. Its objects were the development of port infrastructures, harbour building and the sale and outfitting of boats. The share capital was held by FernandCortez (48 shares), the applicants (24 shares), and Dominique Stizi (104shares). On 29 February 1984 the declared the company insolvent and ordered its judicial reorganisation. 11.By agreements made with Station Service du Bateau and another company, Cortez et Cie, Bleu Marine was granted a licence allowing it to launch its boats on the sea front. 12.In 1983 relations between Bleu Marine and Chantiers Beneteau started to deteriorate, the former owing the latter nearly three million French francs (FRF). Chantiers Beneteau then terminated the distribution agreement with Bleu Marine. 13.On 30 May 1983 Bleu Marine filed for insolvency. On 1 June 1983 the held that the company was insolvent and ordered its judicial reorganisation. 14.On 4 July 1984 the , finding that Bleu Marine had debts of almost FRF 10 million, ordered its liquidation under the supervision of the court. 15.On 20 June 1983 Chantiers Beneteau lodged a complaint with the senior investigating judge against a person or persons unknown for forgery of commercial documents and fraud by the falsification of a balance sheet and its use with a view to obtaining a rescheduling of debt which would never be honoured. On 16 December 1983 the investigating judge sent instructions to the Marseilles Regional Police Department. 16.On 27 June 1984 Fernand Cortez, the manager of Bleu Marine, was charged by the investigating judge assigned to the case. On 8October an additional charge of negligent and fraudulent bankruptcy was brought against him. On 22 January 1985 the investigating judge’s instructions of 16 December 1983 were carried out. The results revealed in particular the existence of a property holding company (société civile immobilière), SCI Le Ponant, which had been set up by Fernand Cortez, MrPélissier and Mr Sassi’s wife, in order to acquire land for letting to Bleu Marine. 17.On 15 October 1984 Mr and Mrs Grouzet lodged a complaint against Fernand Cortez and any other person having managerial responsibility for Bleu Marine, alleging misappropriation and, subsequently, fraud, in connection with the purchase and payment for a boat that was never delivered. On 4 October 1985 a Mr Louis Dreyer lodged a complaint against Fernand Cortez for misappropriation and applied to be joined to the proceedings as a civil party claiming damages. 18.On 14 September 1984, after appearing before the investigating judge on 20 and 21 August and 13 September 1984, the first applicant was charged with the offences set out in the complaint of 20 June 1983 and with negligent and fraudulent bankruptcy and misappropriation. 19.On 12 June 1985 the second applicant was charged with the same offences. 20.After Law no. 85-98 of 25 January 1985, which reformed insolvency law, came into force, the public prosecutor, considering there to be “strong evidence of criminal bankruptcy”, lodged an additional application to have Fernand Cortez, Dominique Stizi and the applicants charged with that offence under the new law. In so doing, he relied on the provisions relating to criminal bankruptcy and aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy. 21.In a letter of 14 November 1985 to the investigating judge, the lawyer acting for Chantiers Beneteau argued that a charge of aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy might lie against the applicants. On 17 July 1986 Chantiers Beneteau applied to be joined to the criminal bankruptcy proceedings as a civil party claiming damages. 22.On 1 December 1986 the investigating judge preferred an additional charge of “criminal bankruptcy” against Fernand Cortez under sections 196 and 197 of the Law of 25 January 1985 and Articles 402 and 403 of the Criminal Code. On 4, 16 and 19 December 1986 he preferred identical additional charges of “criminal bankruptcy” against the first applicant, the second applicant and Dominique Stizi respectively. 23.On 15 June 1987 the investigating judge appointed two accounting experts to audit the accounts. 24.On 30 June 1988 they submitted their report to the investigating judge. 25.On 10 January 1989 the investigating judge made an order transmitting the file to the public prosecutor for submissions (ordonnance de soit-communiqué). 26.On 27 June 1990 the investigating judge made a discharge order on the charges of forgery and using forged commercial documents, negligent and fraudulent bankruptcy and fraud; ultimately, the only charge on which the applicants were committed to stand trial at the Criminal Court was that of criminal bankruptcy under the Law of 25 January 1985. A discharge order was also made in the case of Fernand Cortez on the same charges and on the complaint lodged by Mr and Mrs Grouzet. He was committed to stand trial at the Criminal Court alone (on certain charges for which he was the sole defendant), with Dominique Stizi (on charges relating to the management of Station Service du Bateau), and with the applicants. In his order, the investigating judge cited Articles 402, 406 and 408 of the Criminal Code and sections 196 and 197 of the Law of 25 January 1985. 27.On 12 March 1991 the Toulon Criminal Court sentenced Fernand Cortez to one year’s imprisonment and a fine of FRF 20,000 for fraudulent bankruptcy, concealment of assets and misappropriation. It acquitted Dominique Stizi of the charges against him. Of the civil parties, Chantiers Beneteau’s application to be joined to the criminal bankruptcy proceedings was declared inadmissible and the court noted that Mr and Mrs Grouzet had withdrawn their application to be joined as civil parties; the only person to be awarded compensation was Louis Dreyer (in respect of the misappropriation by Fernand Cortez). 28.In the same judgment, the Toulon Criminal Court held with regard to the bankruptcy charges against the applicants: “It should firstly be noted that under the Law only de jure or de facto managers, not, as suggested by the prosecution, members, can commit the offence. Without it being necessary to consider whether the indictment is bad for failure to allege that the members [the applicants] were de facto managers, that being an essential element of the offence, it need only be observed that [the applicants] have not performed any acts of management, the de jure manager cannot be regarded as having been a ‘replaceable’, compliant manager and it does not appear that he gave the other two the right to sign on his behalf. ... Thus, as they cannot properly be described as de jure managers, the defendants Sassi and Pélissier must be acquitted of these offences.” 29.On 14 March 1991 Chantiers Beneteau appealed against that judgment. The public prosecutor and Fernand Cortez did likewise on 22March 1991. On 2 April 1992 Chantiers Beneteau lodged additional submissions with the registry of the Court of Appeal in which they proposed, in the alternative, recharacterising the acts the applicants were alleged to have committed as “aiding and abetting” criminal bankruptcy. 30.On 26 November 1992, after hearings on 16 April and 25 June 1992, the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal held that although the applicants could not be regarded as having been de facto managers of the company, they had nonetheless been informed of the serious difficulties it was in and had “wilfully performed positive, material acts that had facilitated, aided or abetted Cortez in the concealment of assets to the detriment of Bleu Marine”. It appears from the judgment that the applicants were regarded as appearing before the Court of Appeal as “defendants on criminal bankruptcy charges”. 31.The Court of Appeal consequently held that the applicants were guilty, not of the offences charged, but of the separate offence of aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy through the concealment of assets. As regards the first applicant in particular, the Court of Appeal found, inter alia, that he had furnished a false certificate in order to justify the payment of a sum of money in a suspect operation. It referred in its judgment to Chantiers Beneteau’s main submissions requesting the applicants’ conviction for criminal bankruptcy, but made no mention of the additional submissions lodged on 2 April 1992 concerning the accusation that they had aided and abetted criminal bankruptcy. There is a dispute as to whether that request was brought to the attention of the applicants; however, it is common ground that it was mentioned, as an ancillary point, by the civil party at the hearing. 32.The Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal sentenced each of the applicants to a suspended term of eighteen months’ imprisonment and to a fine of FRF 30,000. While upholding the conviction of Fernand Cortez and the partial discharge order made in his favour by the Toulon Criminal Court, it nonetheless increased the term of imprisonment to eighteen months, while suspending it, and the fine to FRF 30,000. Lastly, the Court of Appeal upheld Dominique Stizi’s acquittal, the award of damages to Louis Dreyer and the declaration that Chantiers Beneteau’s application to be joined as a civil party was inadmissible. 33.On 26 and 27 November 1992 the applicants appealed against that decision to the Court of Cassation on points of law. In their pleadings they denied the offence and contended on the basis of Article 6 of the Convention that the Court of Appeal’s decision to convict them of an offence different from that charged had not been the subject of adversarial argument and had infringed the rights of the defence. In addition, the first applicant submitted that when referring to alleged irregularities on his account the Court of Appeal had relied on allegations that had never been put to him and were incapable of showing that he had aided and abetted criminal bankruptcy. 34.In a judgment of 14 February 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants’ appeal on the grounds that: “... the reasons given in the impugned judgment enable the Court of Cassation to satisfy itself that the court below sufficiently made out, within the limits of its jurisdiction, all the constitutive elements of the actus reus and mens rea of both the principal offence of criminal bankruptcy committed by Fernand Cortez through the concealment of assets and the offence committed by Philippe Sassi and FrançoisPélissier of aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy through the concealment of assets. The grounds of appeal, which merely contest the findings which the court below, in its unfettered discretion, came to on the facts and circumstances of the case after hearing the parties’ submissions, cannot be upheld.” 35.The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide: Article 388 “The Criminal Court shall be seised of offences within its jurisdiction on the voluntary appearance of the parties, a summons accompanied by a statement of the charges, an immediate summary trial or, lastly, a committal by the investigating judge or judges.” Article 509 “The case is transferred to the Court of Appeal to the extent determined in the notice of appeal ...” 36.The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code in force at the material time were as follows: Article 59 “Accessories to a serious crime (crime) or other major offence (délit) shall be liable to the same penalties as the principals, except where statute provides otherwise.” Article 60 “A person who, by gifts, promises, threats, abuse of authority or power, scheming or contrivance, has incited the commission of a serious crime (crime) or other major offence (délit) or given instructions for its commission; has procured weapons, implements or any other means of assisting in the commission of an offence knowing that such weapons, implements or other means were intended for that purpose; or has knowingly aided or abetted the principal or principals in acts preparatory to the commission of the offence or facilitating its commission or in carrying out the offence, shall be guilty of an offence as accessories, without prejudice to the penalties specially imposed by this Code on persons conspiring to commit or inciting breaches of State security, even if the crime intended by those conspiring or inciting is not committed.” Article 402 “Persons found guilty of criminal bankruptcy shall be liable on conviction to between three months’ and five years’ imprisonment and a fine of between FRF10,000 and FRF 200,000 or to either of those penalties. In addition, an order may be made barring them from exercising the rights referred to in Article 42.” Article 403 “Accessories to criminal bankruptcy shall be liable to the same penalties as those laid down in the preceding Article, even if they are not merchants, craftsmen or farmers and do not directly or indirectly, de facto or de jure, manage a private-law legal entity having an economic activity.” 37.The relevant provisions of this law read as follows: Section 196 “The provisions of this Chapter are applicable to: (1)all traders and craftsmen; (2)anyone who has directly or indirectly, whether de jure or de facto, managed or liquidated a private-law entity having an economic activity; and (3)individuals who are permanent representatives of entities managing entities as defined in subsection 2 above.” Section 197 “Where judicial reorganisation proceedings are commenced, the persons referred to in section 196 shall be guilty of criminal bankruptcy if they are found to have done any of the following: (1)with the intention of avoiding or delaying the commencement of judicial reorganisation proceedings, made purchases with a view to resale at less than market value or used ruinous means to procure funding; (2)misappropriated or concealed all or part of the debtor’s assets; (3)fraudulently increased the debtor’s liabilities; or (4)held fictitious accounts or caused accounting documents of the undertaking or entity to disappear or failed to keep any accounts.”",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

78,001-107156,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicants were born in 1949 and 1950 respectively and live in . 10.Their son, an army pilot, died on 16 May 2001, when his plane crashed near the village of Malatya (Akçadağ / Güzyurdu) while transporting troops from Diyarbakır to . Thirty-three other servicemen died in the same accident, five of them also members of the plane’s crew. 11.On 10 May 2002 the applicants applied, through their lawyer, to the Turkish Pension Fund Authority to award them the pension payable under section21 of Law no. 3713, the Anti-Terrorism Act (hereinafter “Law no.3713”). 12.In a letter dated 23 May 2002 the Pension Fund Authority noted that the applicants had been awarded, inter alia, a monthly war disability pension under section 64 of Law no. 5434, as well as a lump sum equal to thirty times the highest salary of a public servant. It further noted that their son’s death had not been caused by an act of terrorism within the meaning of Law no. 3713 but by the fact that, for an unknown reason, his plane had crashed. It was therefore not possible to increase their monthly invalidity pension to the level of the monthly salary paid to an equivalent serving member of the military. 13.On 15 July 2002 the applicants appealed, through their lawyer, to the against that decision. They submitted, in particular, that their son had died while transporting troops engaged in the fight against terrorism from northern , so his death should be considered to have occurred in the context of the fight against the terrorism. 14.On 1 April 2003 the 4th Chamber of the rejected their appeal as being outside its jurisdiction, considering that it was rather a matter for the . Referring to a judgment of the Jurisdiction Disputes Court of 14 May 2001 (E.2000/77, K.2001/22), it held: “... to determine whether the administrative act is “linked to military service” and decide which court has jurisdiction, the object of the act must be examined. If the act was done in keeping with military requirements, procedure and practice, it must be considered to be linked to military service ... Whether or not a non-military authority was at the origin of the act is of no consequence – the Supreme Military Administrative Court is the Court responsible for examining a case [brought by] a member of the armed forces. In the present case the issue is an application for a monthly pension made by the claimants under Law no. 3713 ... To determine whether the claim falls within the scope of that Law, regard must be had to ... the purpose of the military service and the specificity of the locations where it is effected, as well as military aptitude, to show that the impugned act was done in keeping with military needs, procedure and practice. Where this is the case ... it is for the to examine and resolve the dispute. This was, moreover, the line of reasoning of the Jurisdiction Disputes Court’s decision no. E: 2000/77, K: 2001/22, published in the Official Gazette ... of 18.06.2001.” 15.On 3 June 2003 the applicants brought their case before the . In their statement of claim they included a decision adopted by the 10th Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court on 22 January 2003 (E.2002/1059, K.2003/27) in what they considered a similar case (see paragraph 26 below). 16.On 10 June 2004 the rejected their claim. First of all, it observed that the applicants had been awarded a monthly war disability pension as well as a lump sum equal to thirty times the highest salary of a public servant, calculated in accordance with additional section 78 to Law no. 5434 and readjusted in accordance with Law no. 4567. It then noted that their request to have their monthly pension increased to the level of that paid to an equivalent serving member of the military had been rejected by the competent authorities. It pointed out that entitlement under section 21 of Law no. 3713 was restricted to cases where an agent of the State had been directly wounded, disabled or killed as a result of acts of terrorism. It considered that the mere fact that the victim had been employed in work connected with the fight against terrorism did not suffice. As the deceased had not been killed by an act of terrorism, the impugned administrative act was not unlawful. 17.One of the judges expressed a dissenting opinion in which he criticised such a restrictive interpretation of Law no. 3713. Pointing out that it was not disputed that the applicants’ son had died in a plane crash while co-piloting a plane carrying troops returning from an anti-terrorism operation, he considered that the crux of the matter was whether the death fell within the scope of section 21 of Law no. 3713. In his opinion, in view of the purpose of the deceased’s mission that provision was certainly applicable to the circumstances of the case. 18.On 6 July 2004 the applicants lodged an appeal against the judgment of the . In his pleadings their lawyer explained that in his submissions of 10 June 2004 and at the hearing before the Supreme Military Administrative Court the same day he had produced four decisions adopted by the ordinary administrative courts, namely the 6th, 10th and 11th Chambers of the Ankara Administrative Court, concerning applications similar to the applicants’, lodged by four families of servicemen who had died in the same accident as their son; in those decisions the Courts had found in favour of the claimants. He complained that the had made no reference to those cases, and argued that the solution adopted was contrary to the constitutional principles of equality before the law and consistency of the law. 19.In a judgment of 30 September 2004 the rejected the applicants’ appeal as being ill-founded and found the impugned judgment to be in conformity with the law and the requisite procedure. That judgment was served on the applicants’ lawyer. The postmark on the envelope was dated 11 October 2004. 20.’s judicial system breaks down into three categories: the ordinary courts, which include civil and criminal courts; the administrative courts and the military courts. These categories in turn break down into subdivisions according to the subject at issue. These three branches of courts are each headed by their own Supreme Court: the Court of Cassation for the ordinary law courts, the for the administrative courts and the Military Court of Cassation and the for military matters. 21.Under the provisions of Article 157 of the Constitution, the is the body which judicially examines at first and last instance disputes arising from administrative decisions and acts concerning either military personnel or military service, even where they emanate from non-military authorities. Where the dispute concerns compulsory military service, the interested party does not have to be a member of the military. 22.A special court called the Jurisdiction Disputes Court has the power to settle conflicts that may arise between the ordinary, administrative and military courts concerning their jurisdiction and decisions (Article 158 of the Constitution). 23.Section 21 of Law no. 3713 of 12 April 1991 (the Anti-Terrorism Act) reads as follows: “The provisions of Law no. 2330 on pecuniary compensation and monthly pension rights apply to public employees who are wounded or disabled, or die or are killed as a result of terrorist acts, in the performance of their duties, inside and outside the country, or, if they were no longer in active service, because of their [former] duties. ...” 24.The relevant provisions of Law no. 2247 of 12 June 1979 (which entered into force on 22 June 1979) on the creation and operation of the Jurisdiction Disputes Court, read as follows: Section 10 “A conflict of jurisdiction is raised when the Principal State Counsel concerned asks the Jurisdiction Disputes Court to examine a question of jurisdiction following the rejection of an objection of lack of jurisdiction in a dispute before the ordinary, administrative or military courts ...” Section 17 “There is a positive conflict of jurisdiction when cases in which the parties, subject and cause of action are the same are lodged with two different types of court – ordinary, administrative or military – and each court adopts a decision whereby it considers that it has jurisdiction to hear the case.” Section 24 “There is conflict of judgments when the enforcement of a right is rendered impossible by a divergence between the final decisions adopted by at least two of the courts referred to in section 1, provided that those decisions concern the same subject and the same cause of action – but not matters of jurisdiction – and that at least one of the parties [to the case] is the same...” Section 28 “The Jurisdiction Disputes Court immediately gives notice of all the conclusions reached in its decisions to the various Principal State Counsel concerned, the court which applied to it to settle the conflict of jurisdiction, the court or courts awaiting its decision and the persons or bodies that requested settlement of the conflict. The courts concerned, as well as all the authorities, bodies and persons concerned, must abide by the decisions of the Jurisdiction Disputes Court and apply them without delay.” Section 29 “The decisions of the sections and the full court are final. Decisions of principle and decisions of the sections deemed pertinent by the President shall be published in the Official Gazette.” Section 30 “Conflicts between decisions of the sections of the Jurisdiction Disputes Court shall be settled by decisions of principle of the full court ... decisions of principle in matters of jurisdiction are binding on the Jurisdiction Disputes Court and all judicial bodies; decisions of principle on the substance delivered in cases of conflicting judgments are binding only on the Jurisdiction Disputes Court.” 25.Apart from the action brought by the applicants, seventeen actions under Law no. 3713 were brought before the domestic administrative courts by the families of victims of the plane crash of 16 May 2001 following the rejection of their claims by the Turkish Pension Fund. In fourteen cases, four of which concerned close relatives of the plane’s crew members, the appeals were heard by the , which ruled in favour of the victims’ families. On 19 June 2002 (decision E.2002/87, K.2002/870), 22 January 2003 (decision E.2002/1059, K.2003/27), 31 March 2003 (decision E.2003/148, K.2003/522) and 26 June 2003 (decisions E.2002/100, K.2003/1073 and E.2002/101, K.2003/1053), 19October 2004 (decisions E.2004/3051, K.2004/1535 and E.2004/3055, K.2004/1536), 6 and 14 October 2005 (decisions E.2005/1973, K.2005/1424 and E.2005/1743, K.2005/1011), 8 and 29 March 2006 (decisions E.2006/653, K.2006/594 and E.2006/678, K.2006/551), 27September 2007 (E.2007/764, K.2007/1849) and 29 and 30 January 2008 (E.2008/82, K.2008/184 and E.2007/1491, K.2008/135), different chambers of the Ankara Administrative Court (the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 10th and 11th Chambers) adopted judgments in which they acknowledged that the circumstances of the plane crash fell within the scope of Law no.3713. 26.In particular, on 22 January 2003 (decision E.2002/1059, K.2003/27), in response to an appeal to set aside the decision of the pension fund to refuse an application filed by the parents of the deceased pilot to receive the supplementary pension provided for in Law no. 3713, the 10thChamber of the Ankara Administrative Court pronounced a judgment which included the following passages: “... After examination of the file, [it appears] that ... the claimants’ son was the pilot of the aircraft ... whose job it was to transport special troops on a mission against the separatist terrorist organisation PKK, together with their weapons and equipment, to the operation zone and also to take troops leaving that zone back to their units. ... He died on 16 May 2001, when his plane crashed during that mission. After the accident the claimants were awarded a monthly war disability pension under section 64 of Law no. 5434 ... Considering that their son’s death fell within the scope of Law no. 3713, they applied for a monthly pension under that Law ... They brought the present action following the authorities’ refusal of that application ... Examination ... of the above-mentioned legal provisions and the case file reveals that the claimants’ son was killed on 16 May 2001 when the aircraft in which he was transporting troops back from an anti-terrorist mission crashed. The mission in question was clearly part of the fight against terrorism ... accordingly, the impugned administrative act must be set aside ...” 27.Each time an appeal was lodged with it against the above-mentioned judgments of the Ankara Administrative Court, the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the approach of the first-instance court (decisions E.2002/4268, K.2005/333; E.2003/1775, K.2005/5476; E.2003/3110, K.2006/843; E.2003/3860, K.2004/4655; E.2003/3856, K.2004/4656; E.2005/2298, K.2007/8147; E.2005/1399, K.2007/6047; E.2006/1352, K.2009/7096; E.2006/1802, K.2009/7096; E.2007/2275, K.2009/8317; E.2006/9775, K.2009/7138; E.2008/715, K.2010/3868; E.2008/7839, K.2010/3870). 28.On 28 March 2003, referring to the Jurisdiction Disputes Court’s decision of 14 May 2001 (E.2000/77, K.2001/22 – see paragraph 31 below), the 5th Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal, lodged by the family of a sergeant who died in the same plane crash, to set aside the pension fund’s decision rejecting their claim for a monthly pension under Law no. 3713 (decision E.2002/754, K.2003/346). The case was brought before the , which, in a judgment of 13 May 2004, dismissed the appeal, finding that the deceased had not been a victim of terrorism (decision E.2003/14, K.2004/754). On 30 September 2004 it dismissed a subsequent appeal against that judgment (decision E.2004/1199, K.2004/1480). 29.On 2 October 2009 the deceased’s widow filed another application with the pension fund for the monthly pension provided for under Law no.3713, in her own name and on behalf of her son. The application was rejected and an appeal was lodged with the 5th Chamber of the , which that court rejected on 11 March 2010, finding that it lacked jurisdiction (E.2009/1631, K.2001/343). In its reasoning it referred to a judgment of the Jurisdiction Disputes Court of 11 December 2006 (E.2006/246, K.2006/236 – see paragraph 32 below). 30.On 22 February 1999, in response to a request to settle a conflict between the solutions adopted respectively by the ordinary administrative courts and the , which had reached different conclusions in a matter concerning similar points of fact and law, the Jurisdiction Disputes Court adopted a decision (E.1998/75, K.1999/4) which included the following reasoning: “The first paragraph of section 24 of Law no. 2247 on the creation and operation of a Jurisdiction Disputes Court, as amended by Law no. 2592, stipulates: “There is conflict of judgments when the enforcement of a right is rendered impossible by a divergence between the final decisions adopted by at least two of the courts referred to in section 1, provided that those decisions concern the same subject and the same cause of action – but not matters of jurisdiction – and that at least one of the parties [to the case] is the same. By virtue of this provision, in order for there to be conflict of judgments all the following conditions must be met cumulatively: (a) the decisions at the origin of the conflict must have been adopted by at least two [different] courts from among the ordinary, military or administrative courts; (b) the subject matter, the cause of action and at least one of the parties must be the same; (c) the two decisions must be final; (d) the decisions must rule on the merits of the case; and (e) the enforcement of the right must have been made impossible by the divergence between the decisions. Examination of the decisions alleged to be in conflict reveals that they are judgments pronounced by the ordinary administrative courts and the military administrative court, in which, objectively, the subject matter and the cause of action, while based on different material facts, are identical, and at least one of the parties (the respondent administrative authority) is the same; the judgments in question have become final after the exhaustion of the appeals process, and they both rule on the merits. That being so, it is established that the first four conditions required under section24 in order for there to be conflict of judgments have been met. As to whether the result in the instant case has been to render impossible the enforcement of a right ..., in situations where it is impossible for a person to secure the enforcement of a right because of conflicting judgments delivered by two different courts, section 24 leaves it to the Jurisdiction Disputes Court to settle the matter ... ... the administrative court’s judgment setting aside the earlier decision does not affect the judgment of the Supreme Military Administrative Court dismissing the application; the respondent administrative authority, which had to annul the measure in the light of the administrative court judgment in favour of H. and F.G., is under no obligation to execute that judgment in respect of N.T., who was not party to those proceedings. As the action brought by N.T. was dismissed, N.T. cannot be considered to have a right recognised by a judicial decision. ... the claimant cannot claim to have a right recognised by a judicial decision, so her application must be dismissed pursuant to section 24 of Law no. 2247, as the condition that it is “impossible to enforce the judgment”, required for there to be a conflict of judgments, has not been established. 31.On 14 May 2001 the Jurisdiction Disputes Court adopted a decision (no.E.2000/77, K.2001/22), the relevant passages of which read as follows: “... Summary: The application to set aside the pension fund’s decision rejecting a claim for a disability pension ... filed by a person declared by a medical report to be unfit for military service, who considered that his health problem had been caused by his military service, is a matter for the Supreme Military Administrative Court to resolve. ... The merits: ... Under Article 157 of the Constitution, the Supreme Military Administrative Court, although instituted by non-military authorities, is the court of first and final jurisdiction for the judicial review of disputes arising from administrative acts or conduct linked to military service and concerning military personnel. However, it has been established that for disputes arising out of military obligations, it is not necessary to determine whether the person concerned was a member of the armed forces. ... In order for the to be able to examine a case, the impugned administrative act must concern a “member of the armed forces” and be “linked to military service ...” To determine whether the administrative act is “linked to military service” and decide which court has jurisdiction, the subject matter of the act must be examined. If the act was adopted in keeping with military traditions, principles and practice, it must be considered to be linked to military service ... More specifically, administrative acts linked to military service are those related to the capabilities ... of military personnel, their attitude and conduct, their military career, their rights and obligations as members of the military, the purpose of the military service and the specificity of the locations in which they serve. Whether or not a non-military authority was at the origin of the act is of no consequence – the is the court responsible for examining a case [brought by] a member of the armed forces who has been deprived of an advantage. ... where the administrative act concerns a member of the military and is linked to military service, it is for the to examine and settle the dispute.” 32.On 11 December 2006 the Jurisdiction adopted a decision (E.2006/246, K.2006/236) in which it determined which court had jurisdiction to hear disputes concerning pecuniary compensation under Lawno. 3713. The relevant passages read as follows: “The facts: The claimants’ son ... died on 16 May 2001 in the accident at MalatyaAkçadağ-Güzyurdu, when the troop transport plane flying him from Diyarbakır to after a mission in the state of emergency region crashed ... In the proceedings lodged by the claimants following the pension fund’s refusal to award them a pension [although] they alleged that the death had occurred in the course of duties that fell within the scope of Laws nos. 2330 and 3713, the 3rdChamber of the Ankara Administrative Court dismissed the application in a decision of 27/06/2002 (E. 2001/1616, K. 2002/1095), considering that what had happened had not been the result of terrorist acts. On appeal, the 11th Division of the , in a judgment of 30/01/2003 (E: 2002/3971, K:2003/495), set aside the lower court’s decision, considering that the court should have acknowledged the claimant’s entitlement to the rights governed by Laws nos.2330 and 3713, his son’s death having been attributable to terrorist acts. The case was referred back to the lower court, which persisted in its decision, following which the Administrative Divisions of the Supreme Administrative Court, sitting in plenary, upheld the decision of the 11th Division of the Supreme Administrative Court in a judgment of 01/04/2004 (E: 2003/774, K: 2004/409) and again set aside the lower court’s decision ... Although the claimants applied to ... the respondent administrative authority for pecuniary compensation after the , sitting in plenary, confirmed that their son’s death fell within the scope of Laws nos. 2330 and 3713, they received no reply. ... on 25 July 2005 the interested parties appealed to the ordinary administrative courts to set aside the administrative authority’s implicit rejection ... The respondent administrative authority filed an objection for lack of jurisdiction, alleging that the Supreme Military Administrative Court had jurisdiction ... In a decision of 2 March 2006 the Ankara Administrative Court dismissed that objection and declared that it did have jurisdiction. ... The respondent administrative authority filed an application to have the matter of jurisdiction settled ... Principal State Counsel at the ... considers that the dispute ... lies within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Military Administrative Court, and that the decision of the 4th Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court concerning jurisdiction should be set aside ... Principal State Counsel at the ... argues that the dispute ... is a matter for the ordinary administrative courts ... ... [in so far as], when it examined whether the death of the claimants’ son, a serviceman, occurred because he was a victim of terrorist acts within the meaning of Law no. 3713, or in the course of duties covered by Law no. 2330 or as a result of such duties, or, as in this case ... when it reviewed the [rejection] measure, the pecuniary compensation board took into account the serviceman’s military aptitudes ..., his conduct ..., his military career, his rights and duties as a serviceman, the purpose of the military service, the specificities of the locations of the military missions, and military regulations and traditions; and [in so far as,] in the present case, the condition that the administrative act must be linked to military service is fulfilled, the Supreme Military Administrative Court has jurisdiction in the matter at the origin of the dispute ...” 33.In some European countries there is only one Supreme Court. This approach is found in “common law” countries like Cyprus, Ireland and the United Kingdom, but also in Albania, Azerbaijan, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Iceland, Latvia, Moldova, Norway, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia and . Other countries, like Germany, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Finland, France, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, “the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”, Monaco, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Sweden and , have two or more supreme courts. 34.In many of these countries the law does not provide for any means of settling possible conflicts of case-law between the supreme courts, but only for means of resolving possible conflicts of jurisdiction. The authority responsible for settling such conflicts may be a court or a division of a court specially vested with this power (France, Luxembourg, Bulgaria, Lithuania, the ). In Italy the law confers this power on the Court of Cassation; in Austria and Andorra, on the , and in , on the Supreme Court. In there is no judicial authority responsible for settling conflicts of jurisdiction. Lastly, only a small number of countries have courts tasked with resolving conflicts of case-law between supreme courts (Germany, Ukraine and ). In the legislation provides for an a posteriori means of resolving conflicts.",2011,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

70,001-58912,Grand Chamber,"10.Mr Richard Waite is a British national, born in 1946 and resident in Griesheim. Mr Terry Kennedy is also a British national, born in 1950 and resident in Darmstadt. 11.In 1977 the applicants, systems programmers by profession and employed by the British company SPM, were placed at the disposal of the European Space Agency to perform services at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt. 12.The European Space Agency (“ESA”) with headquarters in Paris, formed out of the European Space Research Organisation (“ESRO”) and the European Organisation for the Development and Construction of Space Vehicle Launchers (“ELDO”), was established under the Convention for the Establishment of a European Space Agency (“ESA Convention”) of 30 May 1975 (United Nations Treaty Series 1983, vol. 1297, I – no. 21524). ESA runs the European Space Operations Centre (“ESOC”) as an independent operation in Darmstadt (Agreement concerning the European Space Operations Centre of 1967 – Official Gazette (Bundesgesetzblatt) II no. 3, 18.1.1969). 13.In 1979 the applicants’ contracts were taken over from SPM by CDP, a limited company established in Dublin. In 1982 the applicants founded Storepace, a limited company with its registered office in Manchester, which contracted with CDP on the services to be performed by the applicants for ESA and on the payment due. As from 1984 ESA participated in the above contractual relations through Science System, a firm associated with it. Subsequently, the applicants liquidated Storepace, replacing it by Network Consultants, a company with its registered office on the island of Jersey. These changes in contractual relations had no bearing on the applicants’ services at ESOC. 14.By letter of 12 October 1990, CDP informed the applicants that the cooperation with their company Network Consultants would terminate on 31December 1990, when the term of their contracts expired. 15.The applicants thereupon instituted proceedings before the Darmstadt Labour Court (Arbeitsgericht) against ESA, arguing that, pursuant to the German Provision of Labour (Temporary Staff) Act (Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz), they had acquired the status of employees of ESA. In their submission, the termination of their contracts by the company CDP had no bearing on their labour relationship with ESA. 16.In the labour court proceedings, ESA relied on its immunity from jurisdiction under Article XV § 2 of the ESA Convention and its Annex 17.On 10 April 1991 the Darmstadt Labour Court, following a hearing, declared the applicants’ actions inadmissible, considering that ESA had validly relied on its immunity from jurisdiction. In its reasoning, the Labour Court considered in particular that ESA had been established in 1975 as a new and independent international organisation. It therefore rejected the applicants’ argument that ESA was bound by Article6 § 2 of the Agreement concerning ESOC, which had subjected the former ESRO to German jurisdiction in cases of disputes with its employees which were outside the competence of its Appeals Board. 18.On 20 May 1992 the Frankfurt/Main Labour Appeals Court (Landesarbeitsgericht) dismissed the applicants’ appeal. It gave leave to an appeal on points of law (Revision) to the Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht). 19.The Labour Appeals Court, referring to sections 18 to 20 of the Courts Act (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz), considered that immunity from jurisdiction meant that foreign States, members of diplomatic missions, etc. were generally not subject to German jurisdiction and that no judicial action could be taken against them. Section 20(2) of the Courts Act supplemented the provisions of sections 18 and 19, listing three further sources of law, inter alia international agreements, which could give rise to immunity from jurisdiction, especially for international organisations. ESA in principle enjoyed such immunity from jurisdiction under Article XV § 2 of the ESA Convention and its Annex Moreover, even assuming that the former ESRO had previously waived immunity as regards labour disputes outside the competence of its Appeals Board, ESA was not bound thereby. In this respect, the Labour Appeals Court, referring to the reasoning of the decision of the first instance, set out in detail that ESA had been established as a new international organisation and not as a mere legal successor to the former ESRO. 20.In 1992 the applicants unsuccessfully requested the German federal government and the British authorities to intervene with the Council of ESA in their favour with regard to a waiver of immunity in accordance with ArticleIV § 1 (a) of Annex While the British authorities did not reply, the German Federal Foreign Office referred the applicants to the ESA Appeals Board. In response to their letter to the Council of ESA, its Chairman, by letter of 16December 1992, informed the applicants that the Council, at its 105thmeeting of 15 and 16 December 1992, had decided not to waive the immunity from jurisdiction in their case. This position was confirmed in subsequent correspondence. 21.On 10 November 1993 the Federal Labour Court dismissed the applicants’ appeal on points of law (file no. 7 AZR 600/92). 22.The Federal Labour Court considered that immunity from jurisdiction was an impediment to court proceedings, and that an action against a defendant who enjoyed immunity from jurisdiction, and had not waived this immunity, was inadmissible. According to section20(2) of the Courts Act, German jurisdiction did not extend to international organisations which were exempted in accordance with international agreements. In this respect, the Federal Labour Court noted that, pursuant to Article XV § 2 of the ESA Convention, ESA had the immunities provided for in Annex I of the said Convention, and that it had not waived immunity under Article IV § 1 (a) of that annex. 23.As regards the question of waiver, the Federal Labour Court found that Article 6 § 2 of the Agreement concerning ESOC did not apply in the applicants’ situation as they had not been employed by ESA, but had worked for ESA on the basis of a contract of employment with a third person. The questions of whether the rule in question amounted to a waiver of immunity and whether ESA was bound by this rule could therefore be left open. 24.Furthermore, the Federal Labour Court found no violation of the right of recourse to court under Article 19 § 4 of the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz), as the acts of ESA, being those of an international organisation, could not be regarded as acts of a public authority within the meaning of that provision. 25.Finally the Federal Labour Court considered that a rather broad competence of international organisations to regulate staff matters was not unusual. The regulations on the immunity of ESA did not conflict with fundamental principles of German constitutional law. Employees of ESA could either lodge an appeal with the Appeals Board of the organisation, or the labour contract had to provide for arbitration in accordance with ArticleXXV of Annex In case of any contract conflicting with the Provision of Labour (Temporary Staff) Act which was not covered by the aforementioned regulation, the employee hired out was not without any legal protection, but could file an action against his or her employer. The question of whether the applicants could claim under German public law that positive action be taken by the German government to use their influence to achieve a waiver of immunity in the present case, or to submit the case to international arbitration under ArticleXVIII of the ESA Convention, could not be solved in labour court proceedings. 26.Sitting as a panel of three members, on 11 May 1994 the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) declined to accept the applicants’ appeal (Verfassungsbeschwerde) for adjudication. 27.The Federal Constitutional Court found in particular that the applicants’ appeal did not raise a matter of general importance. The alleged absence of rights resulted from the particular contracts entered into by the applicants, who had not been directly employed by an international organisation but had worked there on the order of a third person. 28.Furthermore, the alleged violation of the applicants’ constitutional rights was not of special importance, nor were the applicants significantly affected. In this respect the Constitutional Court noted the applicants’ submissions according to which they had suffered major disadvantages on the ground that the European legislation on the hiring out of temporary staff had been insufficient and that the termination of their contracts had affected their earning capacity. However, they had failed to show any disadvantages other than those associated with any loss of work. In particular there was no indication that they remained permanently unemployed and dependent upon social welfare benefits. 29.Section 1(1)(1) of the Provision of Labour (Temporary Staff) Act (Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz) provides that an employer who, on a commercial basis (gewerbsmäßig), intends to hire out his employees to third persons – hiring employers (Entleiher) – must obtain official permission. Section 1(9)(1) provides that contracts between the hirer-out (Verleiher) and the hiring employer and between the hirer-out and the employee hired out (Leiharbeitnehmer) are void if no official permission has been obtained as required by section1(1)(1). If the contract between a hirer-out and an employee hired out is void under section 1(9)(1), a contract between the hiring employer and the employee hired out is deemed to have been concluded (gilt als zustande gekommen) as from the envisaged start of employment (section1(10)(1)(1)). Section 1(10)(2) further provides for a claim in damages against the hirer-out in respect of any loss suffered as a consequence of having relied on the validity of the contract, except where the employee hired out was aware of the factor rendering the contract void. 30.Sections 18 to 20 of the German Courts Act (Gerichtsverfassungs-gesetz) regulate immunity from jurisdiction (Exterritorialität) in German court proceedings. Sections18 and19 concern the members of diplomatic and consular missions, and section 20(1) other representatives of States staying in Germany upon the invitation of the German government. Section20(2) provides that other persons shall have immunity from jurisdiction according to the rules of general international law, or pursuant to international agreements or other legal rules. 31.The ESA Convention came into force on 30 October 1980, when ten States, members of ESRO or ELDO, had signed it and had deposited their instruments of ratification or acceptance. 32.The purpose of ESA is to provide for and to promote, for exclusively peaceful purposes, cooperation among European States in space research and technology and their space applications, with a view to their being used for scientific purposes and for operational space applications systems (Article II of the ESA Convention). For the execution of the programmes entrusted to it, the Agency shall maintain the internal capability required for the preparation and supervision of its tasks and, to this end, shall establish and operate such establishments and facilities as are required for its activities (Article VI § 1 (a)). 33.Article XV regulates the legal status, privileges and immunities of the Agency. According to paragraph 1, the Agency shall have legal personality. Paragraph 2 provides that the Agency, its staff members and experts, and the representatives of its member States, shall enjoy the legal capacity, privileges and immunities provided for in Annex Agreements concerning the headquarters of the Agency and the establishments set up in accordance with Article VI shall be concluded between the Agency and the member States on whose territory the headquarters and the establishments are situated (Article VI § 3). 34.Article XVII concerns the arbitration procedure in case of disputes between two or more member States, or between any of them and ESA, concerning the interpretation or application of the ESA Convention or its annexes, and disputes arising out of damage caused by ESA, or involving any other responsibility of ESA (Article XXVI of Annex I), which are not settled by or through the Council. 35.Article XIX provides that on the date of entry into force of the ESA Convention the Agency shall take over all the rights and obligations of ESRO. 36.Annex I relates to the privileges and immunities of the Agency. 37.According to Article I of Annex I, the Agency shall have legal personality, in particular the capacity to contract, to acquire and to dispose of movable and immovable property, and to be a party to legal proceedings. 37.According to Article I of Annex I, the Agency shall have legal personality, in particular the capacity to contract, to acquire and to dispose of movable and immovable property, and to be a party to legal proceedings. 37.According to Article I of Annex I, the Agency shall have legal personality, in particular the capacity to contract, to acquire and to dispose of movable and immovable property, and to be a party to legal proceedings. 38.Pursuant to Article IV § 1 (a) of Annex I, the Agency shall have immunity from jurisdiction and execution, except to the extent that it shall, by decision of the Council, have expressly waived such immunity in a particular case; the Council has the duty to waive this immunity in all cases where reliance upon it would impede the course of justice and it can be waived without prejudicing the interests of the Agency. 39.Article XXV of Annex I provides for arbitration with regard to written contracts other than those concluded in accordance with the Staff Regulations. Moreover, any member State may submit to the International Arbitration Tribunal referred to in Article XVII of the ESA Convention any dispute, inter alia, arising out of damage caused by the Agency, or involving any other non-contractual responsibility of the Agency. According to ArticleXXVII of AnnexI, the Agency shall make suitable provision for the satisfactory settlement of disputes arising between the Agency and the Director General, staff members or experts in respect of their conditions of service. 40.Chapter VIII of the ESA Staff Regulations (Regulations 33 to 41) concerns disputes within ESA. As regards the competence of its Appeals Board, Regulation 33 provides as follows: “33.1There shall be set up an Appeals Board, independent of the Agency, to hear disputes relating to any explicit or implicit decision taken by the Agency and arising between it and a staff member, a former staff member or persons entitled under him. 33.2The Appeals Board shall rescind any decision against which there has been an appeal if the decision is contrary to the Staff Regulations; Rules or Instructions or to the claimant’s terms of appointment or vested rights; and if the claimant’s personal interests are affected. 33.3The Appeals Board may also order the Agency to repair any damage suffered by the claimant as a result of the decision referred to in paragraph 2 above. 33.4Should the Agency – or the claimant – maintain that execution of a rescinding decision would raise major difficulties the Appeals Board may, if it considers the argument valid, award compensation to the claimant for the damage he has suffered. 33.5The Appeals Board shall also be competent in the case where a staff member wishes to sue another staff member and such action has been prevented by the Director General’s refusal to waive the immunity of the latter. 33.6The Appeals Board shall also be competent to settle disputes concerning its jurisdiction, as defined in these Regulations, or any question of procedure.” 41.The Agreement was concluded between the government of the Federal Republic of Germany and ESRO for the purpose of establishing a European Space Operations Centre, including the European Space Data Centre. Articles 1 to 4 of the Agreement concern the site for construction of the ESOC buildings and related matters. 42.Part III of the Agreement contains general provisions. Article 6 provides as follows: “1.Subject to the provisions of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the Organisation and of any complementary Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Organisation according to Article 30 of that Protocol, the activities of the Organisation in the Federal Republic of Germany shall be governed by German law. If the terms of employment of a staff member of the Organisation are not governed by the Organisation’s staff regulations, then they shall be subject to German laws and regulations.>Disputes between the Organisation and such staff members of the Organisation in the Federal Republic of Germany who are not within the competence of the Organisation’s Appeals Board, shall be subject to German jurisdiction.”",1999,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

186,001-58562,Grand Chamber,"5.The applicant company is a public company whose registered office is at Carnaxide (Portugal).>It had in its possession eight bills of exchange that it had received from the A. Lda company for a total of 6,812,106 escudos. As the bills were not honoured when due, the applicant company issued enforcement proceedings against A. Lda in the Lisbon Court of First Instance on 11October 1982 to recover the outstanding amounts.>After being ordered on 22 October 1982 to appear before the court of first instance, the defendant company lodged a defence to the enforcement proceedings on 6 December 1982 (embargos de executado).>On 7 March 1983 the judge gave directions (despacho saneador) setting out the matters that had already been established and those that remained outstanding. After instructions had been sent to the Porto, Vila Real and Bragance courts for witnesses to be heard, the case was set down for hearing on 16 October 1984, but had to be adjourned owing to the failure of the applicant company's lawyer to attend. It was finally heard on 13 November 1984.>On 19 June 1986 the court of first instance found in favour of the defendant company. On 8 July 1986 the applicant company appealed against that decision to the Lisbon Court of Appeal (Tribunal da Relaçao). On 27 May 1987 the case file was transferred to that court. 10.On 28 February 1989 the court of appeal overturned the impugned decision and decided to reject the defence. 11.On 18 May 1989 when the case file was still with the Lisbon Court of Appeal, A. Lda applied for legal aid for its legal costs. That application was refused by the reporting judge in an order of 19 September 1989. A further application made by A. Lda on 23 October 1989 was likewise turned down on 3 November 1989. On appeal by A. Lda, a three-judge panel of the court of appeal upheld those orders on 3 April 1990. A. Lda appealed on points of law to the Supreme Court (Supremo Tribunal de Justiça) on 7 May 1990 and on 5 November 1990 the case file was transferred to that court. 12.In a judgment of 20 December 1990 the Supreme Court dismissed that appeal. On 21 January 1991 A. Lda applied for an order referring the issue to the plenary court (tribunal pleno), but the reporting judge dismissed the application. The Supreme Court upheld that decision in a judgment of 26 September 1991. A. Lda then lodged a further appeal which was declared inadmissible by the reporting judge on 6 January 1992. That decision was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court on 11 March 1992. Then, on 22June 1992, A. Lda challenged the bill of costs, but on 12 October 1992 the reporting judge ordered the transfer of the case file to the court of first instance on the ground that the challenge was intended solely to delay recovery of the debt. 13.On 2 February 1984 a company, F. & F. Lda, issued a summons opposing enforcement (embargos de terceiro). In an order of 9 November 1984 the judge decided that the enforcement proceedings should be stayed until the third-party summons had been heard. However, on 8 April 1987 the judge stayed the summons until A. Lda's defence to the enforcement proceedings had been heard. On 24 March 1993, in the light of the decision taken in the enforcement proceedings, the judge decided to proceed with the examination of the third-party summons. 14.On 19 November 1997 the judge gave directions setting out the matters that had already been established and those that remained outstanding. 15.The proceedings are still pending before the Lisbon Court of First Instance.",2000,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

46,001-77543,Grand Chamber,"11.The applicant was born in 1969 and is currently serving a sentence in Viterbo Prison. 12.On 28 November 1999 the applicant was discovered in possession of a package containing 485 grams of heroin and was arrested by the carabinieri. Proceedings were instituted against him for drug trafficking. On 23 December 1999 the applicant appointed two lawyers of his own choosing, Mr M. Marini and Mrs D. Puccinelli. 13.A hearing was held in private before the preliminary hearings judge (giudice dell’udienza preliminare) on 25 February 2000, attended by the applicant and his two lawyers. The record of the hearing shows that there was no interpreter present. The applicant stated that he understood the content of the charge and the evidence against him and could speak Italian. He subsequently requested adoption of the summary procedure (giudizio abbreviato) provided for in Articles 438 to 443 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”). His lawyers requested that their client’s detention pending trial be replaced by house arrest (arresti domiciliari). The preliminary hearings judge, taking the view that the charges against the applicant could be determined on the basis of the steps in the proceedings taken at the preliminary investigation stage (allo stato degli atti), ordered that the summary procedure be adopted and adjourned the proceedings. 14.A further hearing was held in private on 24 March 2000, at which the applicant and his two lawyers were present. The record of the hearing states that the applicant “speaks Italian” (si da atto che parla la lingua italiana). One of the applicant’s lawyers requested that his client be released on the ground that the drugs in his possession had been intended for his personal use. In the alternative, he requested that his client’s detention pending trial be replaced by a less stringent security measure. The requests were rejected by the preliminary hearings judge. 15.In a judgment of 24 March 2000, the preliminary hearings judge sentenced the applicant to six years’ imprisonment and a fine of 40million Italian lire (approximately 20,658 euros). He observed that the quantity of drugs permitted for personal use must not exceed what was required to meet immediate needs. At the time of his arrest, the applicant had just purchased a quantity corresponding to more than 8,000 average daily doses. 16.The applicant appealed against the judgment, reiterating the arguments adduced at first instance. He contended that interpreting the law on drugs in a way that penalised drug users was in breach of the Constitution. 17.On 1 September 2000 Mr Marini was informed that the hearing had been set down for 3 November 2000. The applicant, who was in Rome Prison, was notified on the same day. He received a letter entitled “Notice to appear in appeal proceedings before the court sitting in private” (decreto di citazione per il giudizio di appello davanti la Corte in camera di consiglio), the relevant parts of which read: “The President ... of the Court of Appeal ... in view of the notice of appeal lodged by (1) Pacilyanathan Basilaran, born [in] Sri Lanka on 1 November 1964, who is [in] Vasto Prison and (2) Hermi Fauzi [sic], born [in] Tunisia on 27 January 1969, who is [in] Regina Coeli Prison ... against the judgment of the Rome preliminary hearings judge of 24 March 2000 convicting them as [set out] in the official record[;] whereas in the appeal proceedings the court must sit in private as the circumstances are those provided for in Articles 443 § 4 [and] 599 § 1 of the CCP ...; having regard to Article601 of the aforementioned Code of Criminal Procedure; gives notice to the abovementioned [persons] to appear at the hearing which the Court of Appeal ... is to hold in private on 3 November 2000, at 9 a.m., to rule on the above appeal. The appellants may, up to five days before the hearing and through the intermediary of [their] lawyers, examine at the registry the records and documents and ... make a copy of and consult them ...” 18.Between 1 September 2000 and the day of the hearing, the applicant had no contact with his lawyers. 19.On 23 October 2000 the applicant’s lawyers filed pleadings with the registry of the Rome Court of Appeal. They submitted that there was no proof that the drugs in the applicant’s possession had been intended for sale; the judges should therefore have accepted the applicant’s assertion that they had been for his own personal use. Moreover, the expert chemical analysis of the drugs had been performed by the police without the defendant’s lawyer being present, and was therefore null and void. The firstinstance judge had also omitted to rule on the objection of unconstitutionality raised by the defence. In the alternative, the lawyers requested a reduction of the applicant’s sentence. 20.At the hearing on 3 November 2000, Mr Marini requested an adjournment of the hearing on the ground that Mrs Puccinelli, the applicant’s other lawyer, was ill. The Court of Appeal dismissed the request. Mr Marini then objected to the continuation of the proceedings in the absence of his client and requested that the latter be brought from the prison to the hearing room. The Rome Court of Appeal dismissed his request, observing that the applicant had not informed the authorities in advance that he wished to participate in the appeal proceedings. 21.In a judgment of 3 November 2000, the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment at first instance. 22.The applicant appealed on points of law. He alleged, inter alia, that the appeal judges had not allowed him to attend his trial and that the notice to appear at the appeal hearing had not been translated into Arabic. 23.In his final submissions, the public prosecutor requested that the impugned decision be set aside. 24.In a judgment of 24 January 2002, the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It observed that neither the Convention nor the CCP required procedural documents to be translated into the language of a non-national defendant in . However, the latter had the right to be assisted free of charge by an interpreter in order to be able to understand the charges against him and follow the progress of the proceedings. As to the other complaints, the Court of Cassation observed that the presence of the defendant was not required under the summary procedure, the adoption of which had been requested by the applicant himself of his own volition. Furthermore, the applicant had not made clear his wish to participate in the appeal hearing. 25.On 4 July 2003 the court responsible for the execution of sentences granted the applicant leave to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. On 10 July 2003 the applicant left Frosinone Prison. On that occasion he signed a report setting out the terms of his house arrest and elected to reside in a property (tenuta) belonging to one of his lawyers. He subsequently returned to Viterbo Prison. 26.The documents produced by the Government before the Grand Chamber show that the applicant was first identified by the Rome police authorities (Questura) on 15 September 1990 in connection with an investigation into drug trafficking. His fingerprints were taken by the authorities on at least seven subsequent occasions: on 18 January and 27February 1991, 5 May and 7 September 1992, 15 January 1993, and 31January and 26 April 1999. On the last occasion, the applicant was arrested driving a stolen vehicle, which he told the carabinieri he had taken a week previously. During the subsequent criminal proceedings against him for theft and driving without a licence, the applicant declared his address and reserved the right to appoint a lawyer. The applicant later sent two handwritten letters to the Viterbo court responsible for the execution of sentences. The letters, dated 20 July and 25 November 2005, were written in Italian and signed by the applicant. In the first, which was two pages long, the applicant complained of the refusal to grant his application for leave of absence. In the second, consisting of a single page, he requested an alternative measure to detention (semilibertà). The applicant had also sent a handwritten letter to the Court of Cassation in March 2004, and on 29 June 2003 had written a short note in Italian to his lawyer. 27.The summary procedure is governed by Articles 438 and 441 to 443 of the CCP. It is based on the assumption that the case can be decided at the preliminary hearing on the basis of the case file as it stands (allo stato degli atti). When the summary procedure is adopted, the hearing takes place in private and is devoted to hearing the arguments of the parties. As a rule, with the exception of cases in which the defendant requests the admission of fresh evidence (integrazione probatoria), the parties must base their arguments on the documents contained in the file held by the Public Prosecutor’s Office. If the judge decides to convict the defendant, the sentence is reduced by one-third. The judgment is delivered in private. 28.The relevant parts of the provisions of the CCP governing the summary procedure, as amended by Law no. 479 of 16 December 1999, read as follows. Article 438 “1.The defendant may request that the case be decided at the preliminary hearing on the basis of the case file as it stands ...>The request may be made, orally or in writing, until such time as the final submissions have been made under Articles 421 and 422.>The wishes of the defendant shall be expressed in person or through the intermediary of a specially instructed representative [per mezzo di procuratore speciale]. The signature on the instruction shall be authenticated by means of the formalities detailed in Article 583 § 3 [by a notary, another authorised person or counsel for the defence].>The judge shall give a decision on the request in the order adopting the summary procedure.>The defendant ... may make his request subject to the admission of new evidence necessary for the court to reach a decision. The judge shall adopt the summary procedure if the admission of such evidence is necessary for a decision to be reached and is compatible with the aim of economy inherent in the procedure, taking into account the documents already before the court which can be used. In such cases the prosecution may request the admission of rebutting evidence. ... ...” Article 441 “1.The summary procedure shall follow the provisions laid down concerning preliminary hearings, in so far as they can be applied, with the exception of Articles422 and 423 [provisions governing the power of the judge to order of his own motion the production of crucial evidence and the possibility for the prosecution to amend the charge]. ...>The summary proceedings shall be conducted in private. The judge shall order the proceedings to be conducted at a public hearing if all the defendants so request. ...>Where the judge considers that the case cannot be determined as it stands he shall acquire (assume) of his own motion the evidence necessary for a decision to be reached. In such cases, Article 423 shall apply.>For the purposes of the production of the evidence [referred to] in paragraph 5 of the present Article and in Article 438 § 5, the arrangements adopted shall be those set forth in Article 422 §§ 2, 3 and 4 [these paragraphs permit the parties to put questions to the witnesses and expert witnesses through the intermediary of the judge and give the defendant the right to request that he be questioned].” Article 442 “1.Once the arguments have been heard, the judge shall take a decision under the terms of Articles 529 et seq. [these provisions concern discharge, acquittal and conviction]. 1 bis.The judge’s deliberations shall be based on the documents contained in the file [referred to] in Article 416 § 2 [the file held by the Public Prosecutor’s Office on the steps taken in the preliminary investigation], the documents [indicated] in Article 419 § 3 [relating to the steps in the investigation taken after the defendant was committed for trial] and the evidence adduced at the hearing.>If the defendant is convicted, the sentence imposed by the judge in the light of all the circumstances shall be reduced by one-third. Life imprisonment shall be replaced by thirty years’ imprisonment. Life imprisonment with solitary confinement ... shall be replaced by life imprisonment.>The judgment shall be served on the defendant if he or she was not present. ...” Article 443 “1.The defendant and the prosecution may not appeal against an acquittal if the object of the appeal is to secure a different form [of acquittal]. ...>The prosecution may not lodge an appeal against a conviction unless the judgment alters the legal characterisation of the offence [il titolo reato].>The appeal proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Article 599.” 29.Article 597 § 1 of the CCP states: “The appeal judge shall be empowered to rule [la cognizione procedimento] solely [limitatamente] on those aspects of the decision referred to in the grounds of appeal.” 30.The relevant parts of Article 603 §§ 1 and 2 of the CCP read as follows: “1.Where one of the parties, in the grounds of appeal, ... has requested the admission of evidence already produced at first instance or of new evidence, the judge, if he considers that he is unable to determine the case as it stands [se ritiene di non essere in grado di decidere allo stato degli atti], shall order the investigation to be reopened.>If fresh evidence has come to light or [has been] discovered since the proceedings at first instance, the judge shall order the investigation to be reopened within the limits laid down by Article 495 § 1 [exclusion of evidence which is prohibited by law, manifestly superfluous or of no relevance to the proceedings].” 31.As indicated in the reference contained in Article 443 § 4 of the CCP (see paragraph 28 in fine above), when an appeal is lodged under the summary procedure, the second-instance proceedings are conducted in accordance with the provisions of Article 599 of the CCP. The relevant parts of Article 599 read as follows: “1.When an appeal relates solely to the type or severity of the sentence, ... the court shall sit in private in accordance with the arrangements set forth in Article 127.>The hearing shall be adjourned if a defendant who has expressed a wish to appear has a legitimate reason for not attending.>In cases where the investigation is reopened after the appeal proceedings have begun, the judge shall take the evidence in private, in accordance with Article 603. The prosecution and defence counsel must be present. If the latter is not present when the reopening of the investigation is ordered, the judge shall set down a further hearing and shall order a copy of his decision to be forwarded to the prosecuting authorities and served on counsel for the defence. ...” 32.The overall arrangements for conducting hearings in private are set out in Article 127 of the CCP, which reads as follows. “When proceedings must be held in private, the judge or the president of the chamber shall set down the hearing and serve notice of it on the parties, other interested persons and counsel for the defence. The notice shall be forwarded or served at least ten days before the date chosen. If the defendant has no counsel, the notice shall be sent to the officially appointed defence lawyer.>Memorials may be filed with the registry up to five days before the hearing.>Evidence shall be heard from the prosecution, the other recipients of the notice and the defence counsel if they appear at the hearing.

95,001-59886,Grand Chamber,"10.On 8 November 1993 the applicant commenced employment as an administrative assistant at the United States Embassy in London, in the Foreign Broadcasting Information Service, which is a subsidiary of the Central Intelligence Agency. She was dismissed from her employment in February 1995. Following her dismissal the applicant issued proceedings against the United States Government in the North London Industrial Tribunal, claiming that her dismissal had been the result of sex discrimination contrary to sections 1(1)(a), 4(1)(d) and 6(2)(b) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (see paragraph 15 below). In particular she alleged that she had been the victim of persistent sexual harassment from her supervisor and that working relationships had broken down in consequence. The United States Government defended the claim and did not, at any stage in these proceedings, claim State immunity. On 13 May 1996 the Tribunal upheld the applicant’s complaint. A compensation figure of GBP 12,000 was agreed between the parties. 11.In June 1995, whilst her first claim in the Industrial Tribunal was still pending, the applicant applied for and obtained a fixed term 12 month contract as an administrative assistant within the Foreign Building Operations section of the Embassy. The contract was due to expire in June 1996. In June 1996 and August 1996 (after the finding in her favour by the Industrial Tribunal), the applicant applied for at least two of the following posts at the Embassy of the United States: secretary with the Office of Foreign Litigation of the United States Department of Justice, temporary secretary with the above office and temporary secretary with the International Marketing Centre, which is operated by the United States Foreign Commercial Service. On each occasion her application was unsuccessful. 12.On 15 September 1996 the applicant issued a second application before the Industrial Tribunal. She claimed that the refusal of the Embassy to re-employ her in two of the above posts was a consequence of her previous successful sex discrimination claim, and accordingly constituted victimisation and discrimination within the meaning of sections 4 and 6 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. 13.By a letter of 10 January 1997, solicitors acting for the United States notified the Regional Secretary to the Industrial Tribunal that the United States Government intended to claim immunity from the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under sections 1 and 16(1)(a) of the State Immunity Act 1978 (“the 1978 Act”: see paragraph 16 below). The letter enclosed an affidavit sworn by the First Secretary at the Embassy, deposing to the fact that each of the posts for which the applicant had applied were part of the administrative and technical staff of the Embassy, and accordingly fell within the ambit of the immunity imposed by section16(1)(a) of the 1978 Act. 14.On 6 February 1997 the applicant received the advice of counsel, to the effect that the United States Government were entitled to claim immunity under the 1978 Act, and that once immunity was properly asserted there was no means by which a court or tribunal in the United Kingdom could accept jurisdiction to entertain the application. Accordingly, the applicant was advised that she had no remedy in domestic law. 15.The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (“the 1975 Act”) creates a statutory cause of action which arises when an employer treats an employee or a potential employee less favourably by reason of her sex (“sex discrimination”), or by reason of the fact that she has taken or intends to take proceedings against any person under the 1975 Act (“victimisation”). Section 1(1) of the Act defines “sex discrimination” as follows: “A person discriminates against a woman in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Act if: (a)on the ground of her sex he treats her less favourably than he treats or would treat a man ...” Section 4(1) of the Act defines “victimisation” as follows: “A person (‘the discriminator’) discriminates against another person (‘the person victimised’) in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Act if he treats the person victimised less favourably than in those circumstances he treats or would treat other persons, and does so by reason that the person victimised has: (a)brought proceedings against the discriminator or any other person under this Act, or ... (d)alleged that the discriminator or any other person has committed an act which ... would amount to a contravention of this Act or give rise to a claim under the Equal Pay Act 1970 ...” Section 6 of this Act defines the circumstances in which it is unlawful to discriminate against employees and applicants, on the grounds of sex discrimination or victimisation, as follows: “(1) It is unlawful for a person, in relation to employment by him at an establishment in Great Britain, to discriminate against a woman: (a)in the arrangements he makes for the purpose of determining who should be offered that employment, or ... (c)by refusing or deliberately omitting to offer her that employment.” (2)It is unlawful for a person, in the case of a woman employed by him at an establishment in Great Britain, to discriminate against her ... (b)by dismissing her, or subjecting her to any other detriment.” 16.The United Kingdom’s State Immunity Act 1978 provides, inter alia, as follows: “1(1)A State is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom except as provided in the following provisions of this Part of this Act. … 4(1)A State is not immune as respects proceedings relating to a contract of employment between the State and an individual where the contract was made in the United Kingdom or the work is to be wholly or partly performed there. 4(2)Subject to sub-sections (3) and (4) below, this section does not apply if-(a)at the time when the proceedings are brought the individual is a national of the State concerned; or (b)at the time when the contract was made the individual was neither a national of the United Kingdom nor habitually resident there; or (c)the parties to the contract have otherwise agreed in writing. 4(3)Where the work is for an office, agency or establishment maintained by the State in the United Kingdom for commercial purposes, sub-section (2)(a) and (b) above do not exclude the application of this section unless the individual was, at the time when the contract was made, habitually resident in that State. … 16(1)This Part of this Act does not affect any immunity or privilege conferred by the Diplomatic Privileges Act 1964 or the Consular Relations Act 1968; and:- (a)Section 4 above does not apply to proceedings concerning the employment of the member of a mission within the meaning of the Convention scheduled to the said Act of 1964 or of the member of a consular post within the meaning of the Convention scheduled to said Act of 1968. ...” 17.Article 1 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which is scheduled to the Diplomatic Privileges Act 1964 provides the following definitions: “(b)the ‘members of the mission’ are the head of the mission and the members of staff of the mission; (c)the ‘members of staff of the mission’ are the members of diplomatic staff or the administrative and technical staff, and of the service staff of the mission.... (f)the ‘members of the administrative and technical staff’ are the members of the staff of the mission employed in the administrative and technical service of the mission.” 18.The 1972 European Convention on State Immunity (“the Basle Convention”), entered into force on 11 June 1976 after its ratification by three States. It has now been ratified by eight States (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) and signed by one other State (Portugal). It entered into force in respect of the United Kingdom on 4 October 1979, and provides, inter alia: Article 5 “1.A Contracting State cannot claim immunity from the jurisdiction of a Court of another Contracting State if the proceedings relate to a contract of employment between the State and an individual where the work has to be performed in the territory of the State of the forum. >Paragraph 1 shall not apply where: (a)the individual is a national of the employing State at the time when the proceedings were brought; (b)at the time when the contract was entered into the individual was neither a national of the State of the forum nor habitually a resident in that State; or (c)the parties to the contract have otherwise agreed in writing, unless, in accordance with the law of the State of the forum, the Courts of that State have exclusive jurisdiction by reason of the subject-matter. >Where the work is done for an office, agency or other establishment referred to in Article 7, paragraphs 2(a) and (b) of the present article apply only if, at the time the contract was entered into, the individual had his habitual residence in the Contracting State which employs him.” Article 32 “Nothing in the present Convention shall affect privileges and immunities relating to the exercise of the functions of diplomatic missions and consular posts and of persons connected with them.” 19.The International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property, submitted to the General Assembly of the United Nations ((1991), II(2) YBILC 13), provides at Article 11, paragraph 1, that: “a State cannot invoke immunity ... in a proceeding which relates to a contract of employment between the State and an individual for work performed in the territory of [the host] State.” However, this provision is specifically disapplied where “the subject of the proceedings is the recruitment, renewal of employment or reinstatement of the individual” and where “the employee has been recruited to perform functions closely related to the exercise of governmental authority”. Although there is no explicit reference to employment at diplomatic or consular missions in these provisions, the commentary indicates that the latter exception was intended to apply in such a context and that all employees at such missions would be precluded from bringing suit on the basis of State immunity. 20.The Committee on State Immunity of the International Law Association adopted in 1982 its Draft Convention on State Immunity, Article IIIC of which dealt with contracts of employment and was similar in its terms to Article 5 of the Basle Convention. An amendment was added to Article IIIC at the ILA’s 1994 conference, providing for immunity to be granted where “the employee was appointed under the public (administrative) law of the foreign state such as, inter alia, members of the mission, diplomatic, consular or military staff”. In the explanatory commentary on the amendment the Committee stated that it wished “to make clear that the employment relationship of any and all diplomatic and consular staff and other members of the mission should be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the forum state”.",2001,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

141,001-59154,Grand Chamber,"10.The applicant is a Gypsy by birth. Since her birth she has travelled constantly with her family, mainly in the Hertfordshire area, in search of work. When she married, the applicant and her husband continued to live in caravans. They have four children. 11.The applicant and her husband used to stop for as long as possible on temporary or unofficial sites while he found work as a landscape gardener. They stayed for several years on an unofficial site in St Albans. They travelled for some years in the Watford area. They were on the waiting list for a permanent site but were never offered a place. They were constantly moved from place to place by the police and representatives of local authorities. Their children's education was constantly interrupted because they had to move about. 12.Due to harassment while she led a travelling life, which was detrimental to the health of the family and the education of the children, the applicant bought a piece of land in 1985 with the intention of living on it in a mobile home. The land is within the area of Three Rivers District Council in Hertfordshire where there is no official Gypsy site. The applicant alleges that a County Council official had told her in 1984 when she was encamped on the roadside that if she bought land she would be allowed to live on it. The Government state that there is no record of such a promise being made and that it would be unlikely that such a promise would be made, since it would be for the District Council, not the County Council, to decide any application. The land was also subject to a 1961 discontinuance order requiring the site not to be used for the stationing of three caravans. 13.The applicant and her family moved on to the land and applied for planning permission. This was to enable the children to attend school immediately. The District Council refused the application for planning permission on 11 September 1986 and served enforcement notices. 14.Appeals were lodged against the enforcement notices. In July 1987 a public inquiry was held by an inspector appointed by the Department of the Environment. He dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of the Council as the land was in the Metropolitan Green Belt and he considered that the national and local planning policies should override the needs of the appellant. Since there was no official Gypsy site in the Three Rivers district the family was given fifteen months to move from their land, the Council having stated that a suitable location was being sought for them and that they would be able to move to a new official site within a year. 15.When the fifteen-month period expired, the family remained on the site since they had nowhere else to go. The applicant applied for planning permission for a bungalow, as it had been stated at the public inquiry that this would be a more appropriate use of the land than a mobile home. Planning permission was refused and the Council's decision was upheld at a further local inquiry. The family remained on the site and the Council served summonses on the applicant and her husband for failure to comply with an enforcement notice. On 18 August 1989 they were both fined 100pounds sterling (GBP), with costs of GBP 50 in the Magistrates' Court. On 23 February 1990 they were again fined, this time GBP 500 each, with costs of GBP 50. To avoid further court action, the family returned to a nomadic life and were constantly moved from place to place by Council officials. The applicant's eldest daughter had started a hairdressing course at a college of further education and the second daughter was about to start studying at college for a diploma in forestry. Both of these courses had to be abandoned and the two younger children could no longer attend school. 16.During this period the applicant made a further planning application for a bungalow on her land. Again her application was refused and failed after an inquiry. In August 1992 the applicant and her family returned to their land in a caravan. Enforcement notices were issued by the Council on 11 March 1993. The applicant appealed against them and there was a planning inquiry on 2 November 1993. 17.By a decision letter of 18 March 1994, the inspector dismissed the appeal. In his decision, he stated, inter alia: “15.Local policies in the Hertfordshire County Structure Plan Review of 1986, as revised by the Approved Alterations of 1991 and the Three Rivers District Plan of 1982, reaffirm that Sarratt and the surrounding countryside lie within the Metropolitan Green Belt ... The Structure Plan contains policies also on Landscape Conservation and Gypsy sites. The District Plan shows that the site lies outside the core of the village, but within an Agricultural Priority Area and also, within an Area of Great Landscape Value, now, by virtue of the Structure Plan, termed a Landscape Conservation Area. ... 19.The appeal site is a deep plot of some 0.77 ha on the frontage of Dawes Lane which leads from Sarratt, a village in the Metropolitan Green Belt; past the site to the west are a few dwellings, a nursery and the Chess Valley. ... ... 24.From the evidence before me and from my inspection of the site and the surrounding area it is clear to me that the principal issues in these matters are, first, whether the developments for which permissions are sought would be appropriate within the Green Belt and, second, whether there are any very special circumstances in your client's cases which would outweigh the general strong presumption against inappropriate development in the Green Belt. 25.Structure Plan policies presume against planning permission in the Green Belt, except in very strong circumstances, for the construction of new buildings, including residential caravans, or certain other specified categories of development. Para. 13 of Planning Policy Guidance 2 – Green Belts – states that, inside a Green Belt, approval should not be given, except in very special circumstances, for other than certain categories of appropriate developments. The previous paragraph emphasises the national presumption against inappropriate development within Green Belts. 26.The latest national guidance, in Circular 1/94, on Gypsy Sites and Planning states in the introduction that a main intention of the document is to withdraw the previous guidance indicating that it may be necessary to accept the establishment of gypsy sites in protected areas, including Green Belt sites. Paragraph 13 goes on to say that gypsy sites are not regarded as being amongst those uses of land which are normally appropriate in Green Belts. 27.None of [the applicant's] projects fall within the categories identified as exempt from national or local assumptions against inappropriate development in Green Belts. ... 28.I hold the very firm conviction that none of the developments referred to in these notices could properly and reasonably be regarded as appropriate in the terms of strong national guidance or long established local policies which all seek to protect the value of the Green Belt designation of the area. 29.This site is in a part of the Metropolitan Green Belt, near to a motorway and particularly vulnerable to development pressure. In my judgment the local and national worthwhile policies that seek to protect the Green Belt would undoubtedly be frustrated for a main purpose of Green Belts is to protect the surrounding countryside from further encroachment. 30.As for alternative accommodation for [the applicant], I was referred to the statutory duty of the County Council to provide a site for [the applicant], who is a gypsy resident in the area, to place her caravan; 23 years after statutory requirement to provide better living conditions for gypsies there were not sufficient sites in the County. The Council would save public money by letting [the applicant] remain here and not put another caravan on the roadside; there had never been an official gypsy caravan site in the District, which, in consequence, had not acquired the benefit of a statutorily designated area. 31.[The applicant] also said that the County Council were under a Direction from the Secretary of State for the Environment, under section 9 of the Caravan Sites Act of 1968 to provide further accommodations for gypsies in the County, but the County Council were not able to confirm progress to establish a 15 pitch gypsy caravan site at Langlebury Lane, Langlebury. ... ... 33.I note that the Council did not refute [the applicant's] comment on caravan site provision in the area, but I do not accept her argument as of sufficient weight to overturn, in the absence of very special circumstances, the cogent planning argument against inappropriate development in the Green Belt here. ... 35.Your client said that the site had been tidied; rubbish, undergrowth and some neglected buildings had been removed; a building had been renovated. ... The caravans are set further back on the site and partly screened by the previously erected large brick building; moreover they were considerably less conspicuous than the previous mobile home which was stationed close to Dawes Lane. ... As for the caravans, your client said that there were few places from which they are likely to be seen by very many members of the public, apart from drivers on Dawes Lane whose attention was likely to be on traffic conditions. 36.I attach more weight to the fact that this site lies in an attractive setting of mainly sporadic dwellings in extensive grounds and in a designated Landscape Conservation Area. To the north-west is the built-up area of the village and to the south-west attractive open countryside in the Chess Valley; it was agreed that the area is popular for recreational walking and riding. 37.I do not consider that the arguments put forward by [the applicant] would justify allowing residential development of this site. I find no reason to differ from the conclusions of my predecessors who considered that it would be wrong to grant permission for this site in a part of the Metropolitan Green Belt which is particularly vulnerable to development pressure. Whatever the conditions attached to specific grants of permission, stationing a residential caravan here would detract significantly from the quiet rural character and appearance of the site. As well as the caravan itself and the external signs of occupation there would be the activities associated with a family on the site and the comings and goings inevitable with the residential occupation. ... 40.There is another factor which reinforces, to my mind, rejection of [the applicant's} appeals. Whilst the local planning authority has to consider every application on its merits at the time, these projects, if allowed, would be very likely to encourage similar schemes. The Council would undoubtedly find it more difficult to refuse such other schemes, with this site as a precedent, and those additional developments would cause significant harm to interests of acknowledged importance, which I consider to be unacceptable. ... 43.At the inquiry in 1987, following enforcement action, the Council told that Inspector that a suitable location for a gypsy caravan site was being sought; [the applicant] would be able to move to the new site within a year. ... ... 45.It appears that little progress has been made since the appeal in 1987. Paragraphs 30 and 31 above indicate that the information given in 1987 to the Inspector about the provision of gypsy caravan sites in the County was optimistic; estimates among Council officers apparently varied between 1 year and 5 years. 46.I note the Council's statement that [the applicant] had not shown interest in a pitch on a Council caravan site but, to my mind, other factors militate against their argument. First, it is not unreasonable for [the applicant] to wait the outcome of these appeals; second, [the applicant] might not unreasonably have declined to make an application for a caravan pitch site provided by the Council, for, as agreed at this inquiry, she has no prospect of obtaining one. ... ... 47.... As I believe [the applicant] to have no better prospect now of obtaining another pitch than in 1987, I shall in the exceptional circumstances of this case, vary the notice, as before, to specify a period of 15 months for compliance with it.” 18.The applicant's father, aged 90, who suffers from senile dementia, now lives with the applicant as he needs constant care and has no one else to look after him. He receives weekly injections from a doctor. The applicant, who has suffered bereavement in respect of her son and grandson since 1993, suffers from depression and has a heart condition. Her husband receives treatment from his doctor and the hospital for arthritis. The applicant's children, previously living on the site, have moved away. 19.There are no local authority sites or private authorised sites in the Three Rivers district. However, the Government submit that there are local authority and authorised private sites elsewhere in the same county of Hertfordshire, which contains 12 local authority sites which can accommodate 377 caravans. 20.According to the draft Local Plan applied by the Council to planning, policy GB.1 specifies that the Green Belt area covers the entire Three Rivers district save for defined urban areas and GB.6 specifies that with the exception of the villages planning permission for development was to be refused except in very special circumstances. 21.The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991) (“the 1990 Act”) consolidated pre-existing planning law. It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land (section 57). A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development (Restormel Borough Council v. Secretary of State for the Environment and Rabey [1982] Journal of Planning Law 785; John Davies v. Secretary of State for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [1989] Journal of Planning Law 601). 22.An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority, which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan, unless material considerations indicate otherwise (section 54A of the 1990 Act). 23.The 1990 Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of State in the event of a refusal of permission (section 78). With immaterial exceptions, the Secretary of State must, if either the appellant or the authority so desire, give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of State. It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence (see Bryan v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22November 1995, Series A no. 335-A, p. 11, § 21). There is a further appeal to the High Court on the ground that the Secretary of State's decision was not within the powers conferred by the 1990 Act, or that the relevant requirements of the 1990 Act were not complied with (section 288). 24.If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission, the local authority may issue an “enforcement notice” if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other relevant considerations (section 172(1) of the 1990 Act). 25.There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of State on the grounds, inter alia, that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question (section 174). As with the appeal against refusal of permission, the Secretary of State must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector. 26.Again there is a further right of appeal “on a point of law” to the High Court against a decision of the Secretary of State under section 174 (section 289). Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review. It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational (R.v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind [1991] Appeal Cases 696, 764 H-765 D). The High Court will also grant a remedy if the inspector's decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors; or made for an improper purpose, in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument. However, the court of review cannot substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision-making authority. 27.Where any steps required to be taken by an enforcement notice are not taken within the specified time-limit, the local authority may enter the land to take the required steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so (section 178 of the 1990 Act). 28.The purpose of Green Belts and the operation of the policy to protect them is set out in national policy document PPG 2 (January 1995). “1.1.The Government attaches great importance to Green Belts, which have been an essential element of planning policy for some four decades. ... ...>4.The fundamental aim of Green Belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open; the most important attribute of Green Belts is their openness. Green Belts can shape patterns of urban development at sub-regional and regional scale, and help to ensure that development occurs in locations allocated in development plans. They help to protect the countryside, be it in agricultural, forestry or other use. They can assist in moving towards more sustainable patterns of urban development.>5.There are five purposes of including land in Green Belts: – to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built-up areas; – to prevent neighbouring towns from merging into one another; – to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment; – to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns; and – to assist in urban regeneration by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land. ...>1.The essential characteristic of Green Belts is their permanence. Their protection must be maintained as far as can be seen ahead. ...>1.The general policies controlling development in the countryside apply with equal force in Green Belts but there is, in addition, a general presumption against inappropriate development within them. Such development should not be approved, except in very special circumstances. ...>2.Inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt. It is for the applicant to show why permission should be granted. Very special circumstances to justify inappropriate development will not exist unless the harm by reason of inappropriateness, and any other harm, is clearly outweighed by other considerations. In view of the presumption against inappropriate development, the Secretary of State will attach substantial weight to the harm to the Green Belt when considering any planning application or appeal concerning such development. ...” 29.Part II of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (“the 1968 Act”) was intended to combat the problems caused by the reduction in the number of lawful stopping places available to Gypsies as a result of planning and other legislation and social changes in the post-war years, in particular the closure of commons carried out by local authorities pursuant to section 23 of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960. Section 16 of the 1968 Act defined “Gypsies” as “persons of nomadic habit of life, whatever their race or origin, but does not include members of an organised group of travelling showmen, or of persons engaged in travelling circuses, travelling together as such”. 30.Section 6 of the 1968 Act provided that it should be the duty of local authorities “to exercise their powers ... so far as may be necessary to provide adequate accommodation for gipsies residing in or resorting to their area”. 31.The Secretary of State could direct local authorities to provide caravan sites where it appeared to him to be necessary (section 9). 32.Where the Secretary of State was satisfied either that a local authority had made adequate provision for the accommodation of Gypsies, or that it was not necessary or expedient to make such provision, he could “designate” that district or county (section 12 of the 1968 Act). 33.The effect of designation was to make it an offence for any Gypsy to station a caravan within the designated area with the intention of living in it for any period of time on the highway, on any other unoccupied land or on any occupied land without the consent of the occupier (section 10). 34.In addition, section 11 of the 1968 Act gave to local authorities within designated areas power to apply to a magistrates' court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of section 10. 35.By the mid-1970s it had become apparent that the rate of site provision under section 6 of the 1968 Act was inadequate, and that unauthorised encampments were leading to a number of social problems. In February 1976, therefore, the government asked Sir John Cripps to carry out a study into the operation of the 1968 Act. He reported in July 1976 (Accommodation for Gypsies: A report on the working of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 – “the Cripps Report”). 36.Sir John Cripps estimated that there were approximately 40,000 Gypsies living in England and Wales. He found that: “Six-and-a-half years after the coming into operation of Part II of the 1968 Act, provision exists for only one-quarter of the estimated total number of gypsy families with no sites of their own. Three-quarters of them are still without the possibility of finding a legal abode ... Only when they are travelling on the road can they remain within the law: when they stop for the night they have no alternative but to break the law.” 37.The report made numerous recommendations for improving this situation. 38.Circular 28/77 was issued by the Department of the Environment on 25 March 1977. Its stated purpose was to provide local authorities with guidance on “statutory procedures, alternative forms of Gypsy accommodation and practical points about site provision and management”. It was intended to apply until such time as more final action could be taken on the recommendations of the Cripps Report. 39.Among other advice, it encouraged local authorities to enable self-help by Gypsies through the adoption of a “sympathetic and flexible approach to [Gypsies'] applications for planning permission and site licences”. Making express reference to cases where Gypsies had bought a plot of land and stationed caravans on it only to find that planning permission was not forthcoming, it recommended that in such cases enforcement action not be taken until alternative sites were available in the area. 40.Circular 57/78, which was issued on 15 August 1978, stated, inter alia, that “it would be to everyone's advantage if as many Gypsies as possible were enabled to find their own accommodation”, and thus advised local authorities that “the special need to accommodate Gypsies ... should be taken into account as a material consideration in reaching planning decisions”. 41.In addition, approximately GBP 100,000,000 were spent under a scheme by which 100% grants were made available to local authorities to cover the costs of creating Gypsy sites. 42.Section 80 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (“the 1994 Act”), which came into force on 3 November 1994, repealed sections 6 to12 of the 1968 Act and the grant scheme referred to above. 43.Section 77 of the 1994 Act gives to a local authority power to direct an unauthorised camper to move. An unauthorised camper is defined as “a person for the time being residing in a vehicle on any land forming part of the highway, any other unoccupied land or any occupied land without the owner's consent”. 44.Failure to comply with such a direction as soon as practicable, or re-entry upon the land within three months, is a criminal offence. Local authorities are able to apply to a magistrates' court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of such a direction (section 78 of the 1994 Act). 45.In the case of R. v. Lincolnshire County Council, ex parte Atkinson (22 September 1995), Sedley J referred to the 1994 Act as “Draconic” legislation. He commented that: “For centuries the commons of England provided lawful stopping places for people whose way of life was or had become nomadic. Enough common land had survived the centuries of enclosure to make this way of life still sustainable, but by s.23 of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 local authorities were given the power to close the commons to travellers. This they proceeded to do with great energy, but made no use of the concomitant powers given them by s.24 of the same Act to open caravan sites to compensate for the closure of the commons. By the Caravans Act 1968, therefore Parliament legislated to make the s.24 power a duty, resting in rural areas upon county councils rather than district councils. ... For the next quarter of a century there followed a history of non-compliance with the duties imposed by the Act of 1968, marked by a series of decisions of this court holding local authorities to be in breach of their statutory duty, to apparently little practical effect. The default powers vested in central government to which the court was required to defer, were rarely, if ever used. The culmination of the tensions underlying the history of non-compliance was the enactment of ... the Act of 1994 ...” 46.New guidance on Gypsy sites and planning, in the light of the 1994 Act, was issued to local authorities by the government in Circular 1/94 (5January 1994), which cancelled Circular 57/78 (see above). Councils were told: “In order to encourage private site provision, local planning authorities should offer advice and practical help with planning procedures to gypsies who wish to acquire their own land for development. ... The aim should be as far as possible to help gypsies to help themselves, to allow them to secure the kind of sites they require and thus help avoid breaches of planning control.” (paragraph 20) However: “As with other planning applications, proposals for gypsy sites should continue to be determined solely in relation to land-use factors. Whilst gypsy sites might be acceptable in some rural locations, the granting of permission must be consistent with agricultural, archaeological, countryside, environmental, and Green Belt policies. ...” (paragraph 22) It was indicated that as a rule it would not be appropriate to make provision for Gypsy sites in areas of open land where development was severely restricted, for example Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Nor were Gypsy sites regarded as being among those uses of land normally appropriate in a Green Belt (paragraph13). 47.Further guidance issued by the Secretary of State dated 23November 1994 concerned the unauthorised camping of Gypsies and the power to give a direction to leave the land (see the 1994 Act above). Paragraphs 6 to 9 required local authorities to adopt “a policy of toleration towards unauthorised gypsy encampments”: “6.... Where gypsies are camped unlawfully on council land and are not causing a level of nuisance which cannot be effectively controlled, an immediate forced eviction might result in unauthorised camping on a site elsewhere in the area which could give rise to greater nuisance. Accordingly, authorities should consider tolerating gypsies' presence on the land for short periods and could examine the ways of minimising the level of nuisance on such tolerated sites, for example by providing basic services for gypsies e.g. toilets, a skip for refuse and a supply of drinking water. ...>Where gypsies are unlawfully camped on Government-owned land, it is for the local authority, with the agreement of the land-owning Department, to take any necessary steps to ensure that the encampment does not constitute a hazard to public health. It will continue to be the policy of the Secretaries of State that Government Departments should act in conformity with the advice that gypsies should not be moved unnecessarily from unauthorised encampments when they are causing no nuisance.>The Secretaries of State continue to consider that local authorities should not use their powers to evict gypsies needlessly. They should use their powers in a humane and compassionate fashion and primarily to reduce nuisance and to afford a higher level of protection to private owners of land.” 48.Paragraphs 10 to 13 further require local authorities to consider their obligations under other legislation before taking any decisions under the 1994 Act. These obligations include their duties concerning pregnant women and newly-born children, the welfare and education of children and the housing of homeless persons. In a judgment of 22 September 1995 (R.v.Lincolnshire County Council, ex parte Atkinson, R. v. Wealden District Council, ex parte Wales, and R. v. Wealden District Council, ex parte Stratford, unreported), the High Court held that it would be an error of law for any local authority to ignore those duties which must be considered from the earliest stages. 49.In a letter dated 25 May 1998, the Department of the Environment drew to the attention of all local planning authorities in England that Circular 1/94 required local planning authorities to assess the need for Gypsy accommodation in their areas and make suitable locational and/or criteria-based policies against which to decide planning applications. The government was concerned that this guidance had not been taken up. ACERT research (see below) had shown that 24% of local authorities (96) had no policy at all on Gypsy sites and that many in the process of reviewing their plans at the time of the survey did not feel it necessary to include policies on Gypsy provision. It was emphasised that it was important to include consideration of Gypsy needs at an early stage in drawing up structure and development plans and that detailed policies should be provided. Compliance with this guidance was essential in fulfilling the Government's objective that Gypsies should seek to provide their own accommodation, applying for planning permission like everyone else. It was necessary, therefore, that adequate Gypsy site provision be made in development plans to facilitate this process. 50.The Advisory Council for the Education of Romany and other Travellers (ACERT) which had carried out research sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions, noted in this report that since 1994 private site provision had increased by 30 caravans per year while the pace of public site provision had declined by 100 caravans, disclosing that the pace of private site provision had not increased sufficiently to counterbalance decreases in public site provision. Noting the increase of Gypsies in housing and the increased enforcement powers under the 1994 Act, it questioned, if these trends continued, the extent to which the ethnic, cultural and linguistic identity of Gypsies and Travellers would be protected. 51.The research looked, inter alia, at 114 refused private site applications, which showed that 97% related to land within the countryside and that 96% were refused on grounds relating to the amenity value (for example, Green Belt, conservation area locations). For most of the 50 Gypsy site applicants interviewed, obtaining permission for their own land was an important factor in improving the quality of life and gaining independence and security. For many, the education of their children was another important reason for private site application. All save one had applied for permission retrospectively. 52.The report stated that the success rate in 624 planning appeals before 1992 had averaged 35% but had decreased since. Having regard, however, to the way in which data was recorded, the actual success rate was probably between 35% and 10%, being the figures given in 1992 and 1996 by the Gypsy groups and Department of the Environment respectively. Notwithstanding the objectives of planning policy that local authorities make provision for Gypsies, most local authorities did not identify any areas of land as suitable for potential development by Gypsies and reached planning decisions on the basis of land-use criteria in the particular case. It was therefore not surprising that most Gypsies made retrospective applications and that they had little success in identifying land on which local authorities would permit development. The granting of permission for private sites remained haphazard and unpredictable. 53.In January 2000 the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions figures on Gypsy caravans in England disclosed that of 13,134 caravans counted, 6,118 were stationed on local authority pitches, 4,500 on privately owned sites and 2,516 on unauthorised sites. Of the latter, 684 Gypsy caravans were being tolerated on land owned by non-Gypsies (mainly local authority land) and 299 Gypsy caravans tolerated on land owned by Gypsies themselves. On these figures, about 1,500 caravans were therefore on unauthorised and untolerated sites while over 80% of caravans were stationed on authorised sites. 54.Local authority duties to the homeless were contained in Part VII of the Housing Act 1996, which came fully into force on 20 January 1997. Where the local housing authority was satisfied that an applicant was homeless, eligible for assistance, had a priority need (for example, the applicant was a person with whom dependant children resided or was vulnerable due to old age, physical disability, etc.) and did not become homeless intentionally, the authority was required, if it did not refer the application to another housing authority, to ensure that accommodation was made available to the applicant for a minimum period of two years. Where an applicant was homeless, eligible for assistance and not homeless intentionally, but was not a priority case, the local housing authority was required to provide the applicant with advice and such assistance as it considered appropriate in the circumstances in any attempt he might make to secure accommodation. 55.This convention, opened for signature on 1 February 1995, provides, inter alia: “Article 1 The protection of national minorities and of the rights and freedoms of persons belonging to those minorities forms an integral part of the international protection of human rights, and as such falls within the scope of international co-operation. ... Article 4>The Parties undertake to guarantee to persons belonging to national minorities the right of equality before the law and of equal protection of the law. In this respect, any discrimination based on belonging to a national minority shall be prohibited.>The Parties undertake to adopt, where necessary, adequate measures in order to promote, in all areas of economic, social, political and cultural life, full and effective equality between persons belonging to a national minority and those belonging to the majority. In this respect, they shall take due account of the specific conditions of the persons belonging to national minorities.>The measures adopted in accordance with paragraph 2 shall not be considered to be an act of discrimination. Article 5>The Parties undertake to promote the conditions necessary for persons belonging to national minorities to maintain and develop their culture, and to preserve the essential elements of their identity, namely their religion, language, traditions and cultural heritage.>Without prejudice to measures taken in pursuance of their general integration policy, the Parties shall refrain from policies or practices aimed at assimilation of persons belonging to national minorities against their will and shall protect these persons from any action aimed at such assimilation.” 56.The convention entered into force on 1 February 1998. The United Kingdom signed the convention on the date it opened for signature and ratified it on 15 January 1998. It entered into force for the United Kingdom on 1 May 1998. By 9 February 2000, it had been signed by 37 of the Council of Europe's 41 member States and ratified by 28. 57.The convention does not contain any definition of “national minority”. However, the United Kingdom in its report of July 1999 to the advisory committee concerned with the convention accepted that Gypsies are within the definition. 58.Recommendation 1203 (1993) of the Parliamentary Assembly on Gypsies in Europe included the recognition that Gypsies, as one of the very few non-territorial minorities in Europe, “need special protection”. In its general observations the Assembly stated, inter alia: “6.Respect for the rights of Gypsies, individual, fundamental and human rights and their rights as a minority is essential to improve their situation.>Guarantees for equal rights, equal chances, equal treatment and measures to improve their situation will make a revival of Gypsy language and culture possible, thus enriching the European cultural diversity.” Its recommendations included: “xv.member states should alter national legislation and regulations which discriminate directly or indirectly against Gypsies;” “xviii.further programmes should be set up in the member states to improve the housing situation, education ... of those Gypsies who are living in less favourable circumstances; ...” 59.In 1998 the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance adopted General Policy Recommendation no. 3: Combating racism and intolerance against Roma/Gypsies. Its recommendations included: “to ensure that discrimination as such, as well as discriminatory practices, are combated through adequate legislation and to introduce into civil law specific provisions to this end, particularly in the fields of ... housing and education; ... to ensure that the questions relating to 'travelling' within a country, in particular regulations concerning residence and town planning, are solved in a way which does not hinder the way of life of the persons concerned;” 60.On 21 April 1994 the European Parliament adopted a Resolution on the situation of Gypsies in the Community (Official Journal of the European Communities no. C 128/372 of 9 May 1994), calling on the governments of member States “to introduce legal, administrative and social measures to improve the social situation of Gypsies and Travelling People in Europe”; and recommending that “the Commission, the Council and the governments of member States should do everything in their power to assist in the economic, social and political integration of Gypsies, with the objective of eliminating the deprivation and poverty in which the great majority of Europe's Gypsy population still lives at the present time”. 61.Protection of minorities has become one of the preconditions for accession to the European Union. In November 1999 the European Union adopted “Guiding Principles” for improving the situation of Roma in candidate countries, based expressly on the recommendations of the Council of Europe's Specialist Group on Roma/Gypsies and those of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities. 62.The situation of Roma and Sinti has become a standard item on the “human dimension” section of the agenda of OSCE review conferences. Two structural developments – the Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the appointment of a High Commissioner on National Minorities – also concerned protection of Roma and Sinti as minorities. 63.On 7 April 2000 the High Commissioner's report on the situation of Roma and Sinti in the OSCE area was published. Part IV of the report dealt with the living conditions of Roma, noting that while nomadism had been central to Romani history and culture a majority of Roma were now sedentary (one estimation gave 20% as nomadic, 20% as semi-nomadic, moving seasonally, while 60% were sedentary). This was particularly true of central and eastern Europe, where there had been policies of forced sedentarisation in the past: “It must be emphasised that whether an individual is nomadic, semi-nomadic or sedentary should, like other aspects of his or her ethnic identity, be solely a matter of personal choice. The policies of some OSCE participating States have at times breached this principle, either by making a determination of a group's fundamental lifestyle that is inconsistent with its members' choices or by making it virtually impossible for individuals to pursue the lifestyle that expresses their group identity.” (pp. 98-99) 64.The report stated that for those Roma who maintained a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle the availability of legal and suitable parking sites was a paramount need and precondition to the maintenance of their group identity. It observed, however, that even in those countries that encouraged or advised local authorities to maintain parking sites, the number and size of available sites was insufficient compared to the need: “... The effect is to place nomadic Roma in the position of breaking the law – in some countries, committing a crime – if they park in an unauthorised location, even though authorised sites may not be available.” (pp. 108-09) 65.The report dealt specifically with the situation of Gypsies in the United Kingdom (pp. 109-14). It found: “Under current law, Gypsies have three options for lawful camping: parking on public caravan sites – which the Government acknowledges to be insufficient; parking on occupied land with the consent of the occupier; and parking on property owned by the campers themselves. The British Government has issued guidance to local authorities aimed at encouraging the last approach. In practice, however, and notwithstanding official recognition of their special situation and needs, many Gypsies have encountered formidable obstacles to obtaining the requisite permission to park their caravans on their own property. ...” (pp. 112-13). 66.Concerning the planning regime which requires planning permission for the development of land towards the stationing of caravans, it stated: “... This scheme allows wide play for the exercise of discretion – and that discretion has repeatedly been exercised to the detriment of Gypsies. A 1986 report by the Department of the Environment described the prospects of applying for planning permission for a Gypsy site as 'a daunting one laced with many opportunities for failure'. In 1991, the last years in which the success of application rates was evaluated, it was ascertained that 90 per cent of applications for planning permission by Gypsies were denied. In contrast, 80 per cent of all planning applications were granted during the same period. It is to be noted that, as a category, Gypsy planning applications are relatively unique in so far as they typically request permission to park caravans in areas or sites which are subject to restriction by local planning authorities. As such, virtually all Gypsy planning applications are highly contentious. Nonetheless, the fact remains that there is inadequate provision or availability of authorised halting sites (private or public), which the high rate of denial of planning permission only exacerbates. Moreover, there are indications that the situation has deteriorated since 1994. ... In face of these difficulties, the itinerant lifestyle which has typified the Gypsies is under threat.” (pp. 113-14) 67.The report's recommendations included the following: “... in view of the extreme insecurity many Roma now experience in respect of housing, governments should endeavour to regularise the legal status of Roma who now live in circumstances of unsettled legality.” (pp. 126 and 162)",2001,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

43,001-59589,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicant is an Italian citizen, born in 1947 and living in Oristano (Italy). 10.The applicant and another person transferred land, property and a sum of money to a limited liability company, A., which the applicant had just formed and of which he owned – directly and indirectly – almost the entire share capital and was the representative. The company, whose object was organising farm holidays for tourists (agriturismo), applied to the tax authorities for a reduction in the applicable rate of certain taxes payable on the above-mentioned transfer of property, in accordance with a statute which it deemed applicable, and paid the sum it considered due. 11.The present case concerns three sets of proceedings. The first concerned in particular the payment of capital-gains tax (INVIM, imposta sull’incremento di valore immobiliare) and the two others the applicable rate of stamp duty, mortgage-registry tax and capital-transfer tax (imposta di registro, ipotecaria e voltura), and the application of a reduction in the rate. 12.In the first set of proceedings, the tax authorities served a supplementary tax assessment on the applicant on 31 August 1987 on the ground that the property transferred to the company had been incorrectly valued. They requested payment of an aggregate sum of 43,624,700 Italian lire comprising the tax due and penalties. On 14 January 1988 the applicant applied to the Oristano District Tax Commission for the supplementary tax assessment to be set aside. In a letter of 7 February 1998 the District Tax Commission informed the applicant that a hearing had been listed for 21 March 1998. In the meantime, on 23 February 1998, the tax authorities informed the commission that they accepted the applicant’s comments and requested the case to be struck out of the list. In a decision of 21 March 1998, the text of which was deposited on 4 April 1998, the District Tax Commission struck the case out of the list. 13.In the other two sets of proceedings, the tax authorities served two supplementary tax assessments on A. on 16 November 1987 on the ground that the company was ineligible for the reduced rate of tax to which it had referred. The tax authorities’ note stated that the company would be liable to an administrative penalty of 20% of the amounts requested if payment was not made within sixty days. On 15 January 1988 the applicant, acting in his own right, although the matter concerned the company A., lodged two applications with the Oristano District Tax Commission for the above-mentioned supplementary tax assessments to be set aside. In two letters of 20 March 1998 the District Tax Commission informed the applicant, in his capacity as representative of A., that a hearing had been listed for 9 May 1998 in the two other cases. In two orders of that date the District Tax Commission adjourned the cases sine die and gave the applicant thirty days in which to appoint a lawyer. Subsequently, a hearing was listed for 24 April 1999. In two decisions of 22 May 1999, the text of which was deposited at the registry on 16 July 1999, the District Tax Commission dismissed A.’s applications on the ground that the transferred property, which included, among other things, a swimming pool and a tennis court, could not be regarded as the normal assets of an agricultural company. On 27 October 2000 A. lodged an appeal with the Regional Tax Commission.",2001,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

148,001-58197,Grand Chamber,"9.Mr İbrahim Incal, a Turkish national born in 1953, lives in İzmir. A lawyer by profession, he was at the material time a member of the executive committee of the İzmir section of the People’s Labour Party (“the HEP”). That party, which was represented in the National Assembly, was dissolved by the Constitutional Court on 14 July 1993. 10.On 1 July 1992 the executive committee decided to distribute in the İzmir constituency a leaflet criticising the measures taken by the local authorities, in particular against small-scale illegal trading and the sprawl of squatters’ camps around the city. The title of the leaflet, of which ten thousand copies were printed, was “To all democratic patriots!”, and the text read as follows: “In the last few days a campaign aimed at ‘DRIVING THE KURDS OUT OF THE CITIES’ has been launched in İzmir against the Kurdish population by a combination of prefecture, security police and town hall. In this campaign İzmir has been designated a pilot-city. The first stage was the operation [against] street traders, stallkeepers and mussel sellers, whom they tried to hide away on the ground that it was necessary to smarten up the city and ease traffic congestion. The purpose of this operation was to impose an ‘economic blockade’ on our, mainly Kurdish, fellow citizens who make their living through these activities, condemning them to destitution and starvation. In this way the masses were to be frightened, oppressed and compelled to return to their province of origin. Before the ‘DRIVING THE KURDS OUT’ campaign began the organisational and psychological ground had already been prepared by leaflets signed by ‘Patriotic inhabitants of İzmir’ and handed out in large numbers for weeks by ‘obscure forces’. These leaflets incited hostility against the Kurdish population in particular and stirred up anti-Kurdish feelings. This led to racist and chauvinistic anti-Kurdish attitudes through propaganda saying: ‘Don’t give employment or housing to the Kurds. Don’t speak to them, don’t let your daughters marry them and don’t marry one yourself. Smash the Kurds.’ That is how the psychological foundations were laid down, the preparations for the future offensives. Although these leaflets were handed out in broad daylight, those responsible – and nobody knows why – were never arrested. But the campaign was by no means limited to the operation against street traders, stallkeepers and mussel sellers. The second prong was ‘Operation shantytown’. The same combination of prefecture, security police and town hall launched the demolition of the squatters’ camps. It began in Yamanlar and Şemikler and continued in Gaziemir, [all] shantytown districts inhabited mainly by Kurds, who, before the elections, were regarded by the parties in favour of the status quo as a source of votes. Those who had encouraged the mushrooming of the shantytowns by dishonestly promising freedom to build in exchange for votes and those who, with the local mafia, had appropriated public land this time set about the ferocious destruction of these huts to oppress and intimidate the Kurds and force them to go back home. The Kurdish and Turkish proletarian people suddenly and without any warning saw the huts they had run into debt to build, with so many sacrifices made by cutting down on their children’s food, collapsing about their ears. That is how they are trying to oppress the Kurdish and Turkish people and drive them into distress and despair. IT’S STATE TERROR AGAINST TURKISH AND KURDISH PROLETARIANS! It is certain that these demolitions, which began in Yamanlar and are still continuing in Gaziemir, will soon spread to İzmir’s other shantytowns. The State is testing the people’s reactions and will to resist by causing various kinds of destruction. Passivity as a form of defence against this devastation has encouraged the State to commit further kinds of destruction. In conclusion: The ‘Driving-the-Kurds-Out policy’ forms part of the SPECIAL WAR being conducted in the country at present against the Kurdish people. It is one of the mechanisms of that war, the way it impinges on the cities. Because the methods used are the same, namely enslavement, violence, terror and oppression through compulsion. It is a psychological war. While, in the country, they are trying to oppress and silence the people through counter-insurgency tactics, special patrols, village guards, the SS decree and every [other] form of State terror, in İzmir they want to achieve the same aim by depriving our fellow citizens of their means of subsistence and in the end by knocking their houses down about their ears. The methods used, although different in form, are in the final analysis mechanisms serving the purposes of the special war. It is the urban form of the special war. TO ALL DEMOCRATIC PATRIOTS! The way to nullify these insults to the cities is to set up NEIGHBOURHOOD COMMITTEES BASED ON THE PEOPLE’S OWN STRENGTH. We call on all Kurdish and Turkish democratic patriots to assume their responsibilities and oppose this special war being waged against the proletarian people. LONG LIVE THE BROTHERHOOD OF NATIONS! STOP THE SPECIAL WAR BEING SPREAD INTO THE CITIES!” 11.By a letter of 2 July 1992, accompanied by a copy of the leaflet in question, the president of the HEP informed the İzmir prefecture of the executive committee’s decision (see paragraph 10 above) and asked for permission to implement it. 12.The İzmir security police, to whom this request had been referred, considered that the leaflet contained separatist propaganda capable of inciting the people to resist the government and commit criminal offences. On 3 July 1992 they asked the Principal Public Prosecutor attached to the İzmir National Security Court (“the public prosecutor”, “the National Security Court”) to state his opinion as to whether the contents of the leaflet contravened the law. 13.On the same day, at the request of the public prosecutor’s office, a substitute judge of the National Security Court issued an injunction ordering the seizure of the leaflets and prohibiting their distribution. The police searched the HEP’s premises in İzmir, first at the headquarters, where the party leaders handed over, without demur, nine thousand copies of the leaflet which were still parcelled up, and then at the Buca district office, where the thousand remaining copies were seized. 14.Still on 3 July 1992 the public prosecutor’s office opened a criminal investigation against the HEP’s local leaders and the members of its executive committee, including the applicant. 15.On 27 July 1992 the public prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings in the National Security Court against the applicant and the other eight members of the HEP committee who had taken part in the decision of 1 July 1992 (see paragraph 10 above). Citing the text of the leaflet, he accused them of attempting to incite hatred and hostility through racist words and asked the court to apply Articles 312 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code, section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) and additional section 4 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680) (see paragraphs 21, 23 and 24 below). He also asked the court to order confiscation of the leaflets. 16.On 9 February 1993 the National Security Court, composed of three judges, one of whom was a member of the Military Legal Service, found the applicant guilty of the offences charged and sentenced him to six months and twenty days’ imprisonment and a fine of 55,555 Turkish liras. It also ordered the confiscation of the leaflets and disqualified him from driving for fifteen days. In its interpretation of the wording of the leaflet, the National Security Court accepted the public prosecutor’s oral submissions entirely, except for that part which related to the applicability of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713). It noted in particular that the leaflet suggested recourse to resistance against the police and the establishment of “neighbourhood committees”, which it held to be illegal forms of protest. It further held that the offence had been intentionally committed, since the accused had not contested either the existence or wording of the text on which the charge was based. With regard to the severity of the sentence, it observed that although commission of the offence through the medium of print was an aggravating circumstance, it was necessary to take into account the accused’s good faith and the fact that the authorities had been able to lay hands on the leaflets before they had been distributed. 17.On 9 March 1993 the applicant and the other convicted persons appealed to the Court of Cassation. In their notice of appeal they asked for a public hearing to be held and challenged the National Security Court’s interpretation of the leaflet and its refusal to commute the prison sentence to a fine. 18.On 20 May the Principal Public Prosecutor attached to the Court of Cassation forwarded the case file together with an opinion couched in a standard form of words – which was not communicated to Mr Incal – asking the court to uphold the judgment. 19.In a judgment of 6 July 1993 the Court of Cassation upheld all the operative provisions of the impugned judgment, after observing that, regard being had to the nature and length of the sentence imposed at first instance, it was not necessary to hold a hearing. 20.On 23 August 1993 the prosecuting authorities decided, at the applicant’s request, to stay execution of the prison sentence for four months. 21.The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows: Article 311 § 2 “Public incitement to commit an offence Where the incitement [to commit an offence] is done by means of mass communication, of whatever type, by tape recordings, gramophone records, newspapers, press publications or other published material, by the circulation or distribution of printed papers or by the placing of placards or posters in public places, the terms of imprisonment to which convicted persons are liable shall be doubled…” Article 312 “Non-public incitement to commit an offence Whosoever expressly praises or condones an act punishable by law as an offence or incites the population to break the law shall be sentenced to between six months’ and two years’ imprisonment and a … fine of between six thousand and thirty thousand liras. Whosoever expressly arouses hatred and hostility in society on the basis of a distinction between social classes, races or religions, or one based on allegiance to a particular denomination or region, shall be sentenced to between one and three years’ imprisonment and a fine of between nine thousand and thirty-six thousand liras. If this incitement is done in a manner likely to endanger public safety, the sentence shall be increased [by one third to one half]. The penalties to be imposed on those who have committed the above-mentioned offences by the means listed in Article 311 § 2 shall be doubled.” 22.A conviction under Article 312 § 2 entails further consequences, particularly with regard to the exercise of certain activities governed by special legislation. For example, persons convicted of an offence under that section may not found associations (Law no. 2908, section 4(2)(b)) or trade unions, nor may they be members of the executive committee of a trade union (Law no. 2929, section 5). They are also forbidden to found or join political parties (Law no. 2820, section 11(5)) and may not stand for election to Parliament (Law no. 2839, section 11(f3)). In addition, if the sentence imposed exceeds six months’ imprisonment, the convicted person is debarred from entering the civil service, provided that the offence has been committed intentionally (Law no. 657, section 48(5)). 23.Additional section 4(1) of the Press Act (Law no. 5680) provides: “Where distribution [of the printed matter whose distribution constitutes the offence] is prevented … by a court injunction or, in an emergency, by order of the Principal Public Prosecutor, to be confirmed by a court, … the penalty imposed shall be one-third of that laid down by law for the offence concerned.” 24.Law no. 3713 of 12 April 1991, promulgated with a view to preventing acts of terrorism, refers to a number of offences defined in the Criminal Code which it describes as “acts of terrorism” or “acts perpetrated for the purposes of terrorism” (sections 3 and 4) and to which it applies. However, the act punishable pursuant to Article 312 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 21 above) is not among them. 25.Article 318 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the holding of a public hearing in proceedings before the Court of Cassation only where the impugned judgment concerns offences classified as “serious”, such as those punishable by the death penalty or a term of imprisonment of more than ten years. The Court of Cassation’s jurisdiction, according to Article 307 of the Code, is limited to questions concerning the lawfulness and procedural regularity of the first-instance judgment. 26.The National Security Courts were created by Law no. 1773 of 11July 1973, in accordance with Article 136 of the 1961 Constitution. That Law was annulled by the Constitutional Court on 15 June 1976. The courts in question were later reintroduced into the Turkish judicial system by the 1982 Constitution. The relevant part of the statement of reasons contains the following passage: “There may be acts affecting the existence and stability of a State such that when they are committed special jurisdiction is required in order to give judgment expeditiously and appropriately. For such cases it is necessary to set up National Security Courts. According to a principle inherent in our Constitution, it is forbidden to create a special court to [give judgment on] a specific act after it has been committed. For that reason the National Security Courts have been provided for in our Constitution to try cases involving the above-mentioned offences. Given that the special provisions laying down their powers have [thus] been enacted in advance and that the courts have been created before the commission of any offence …, they may not be described as courts set up to deal with this or that offence after the commission of such an offence.” The composition and functioning of the National Security Courts are subject to the following rules. 27.The constitutional provisions governing judicial organisation are worded as follows: Article 138 §§ 1 and 2 “In the performance of their duties, judges shall be independent; they shall give judgment, according to their personal conviction, in accordance with the Constitution, statute and the law. No organ, authority, officer or other person may give orders or instructions to courts or judges in the exercise of their judicial powers, or send them circulars or make recommendations or suggestions to them.” Article 139 § 1 “Judges … shall not be removed from office or compelled to retire without their consent before the age prescribed by the Constitution…” Article 143 § 4 “Presidents, regular members and substitute judges of the National Security Courts shall be appointed for a renewable period of four years.” Article 145 § 4 “The personal rights and obligations of military judges … shall be regulated by law in accordance with the principles of the independence of the courts, the safeguards enjoyed by the judiciary and the requirements of military service. Relations between military judges and the commanders under whom they serve as regards their non-judicial duties shall also be regulated by law...” 28.Based on Article 143 of the Constitution, the relevant provisions of Law no. 2845 on the National Security Courts, provide as follows: Section 1 “In the capitals of the provinces of … National Security Courts shall be established to try persons accused of offences against the Republic – whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution – against the indivisible unity of the State – meaning both the national territory and its people – or against the free, democratic system of government and offences directly affecting the State’s internal or external security.” Section 3 “The National Security Courts shall be composed of a president and two other regular members. In addition, there shall sit at each National Security Court two substitute members.” Section 5 “The president of a National Security Court, one of the other regular members and one of the substitutes shall be civilian … judges, the other members, whether full or substitute, military judges of the first rank…” Section 6(2), (3) and (6) “The appointment of military judges to sit as regular members and substitutes shall be carried out according to the procedure laid down for that purpose in the special legislation [concerning those posts]. Except as provided in the present Law or other legislation, the president and the regular or substitute members of the National Security Courts … may not be appointed to another post or place, without their consent, within four years… … If, after an investigation concerning the presidents and regular or substitute members of the National Security Courts conducted according to the legislation concerning them, competent committees or authorities decide to change the duty station of a military judge, the duty station of that judge or his duties [themselves] … may be changed in accordance with the procedure laid down in that legislation.” Section 9(1)(a) “The National Security Courts shall try persons accused of the offences defined in (a)[Article] 312 § 2 … of the Turkish Criminal Code…” Section 27(1) “The Court of Cassation shall hear appeals from the judgments of the National Security Courts.” Section 34(1) and (2) “The rules governing the rights and obligations of … military judges appointed to the National Security Courts and their supervision …, the institution of disciplinary proceedings against them, the imposition of disciplinary penalties on them and the investigation and prosecution of any offences … they may commit in the performance of their duties shall be as laid down in the relevant provisions of the laws governing their professions… The observations of the Court of Cassation and the assessment reports drawn up by Ministry of Justice assessors on judges of the Military Legal Service … and the files on any investigations conducted against them … shall be transmitted to the Ministry of Justice.” Section 38 “A National Security Court may be transformed into a Martial-Law Court, under the conditions set forth below, where a state of emergency has been declared in all or part of the territory in respect of which the National Security Court concerned has jurisdiction, provided that within that territory there is more than one National Security Court…” 29.The relevant provisions of the Military Legal Service Act are worded as follows: Additional section 7 “The aptitude of military judges … appointed as regular or substitute members of the National Security Courts that is required for promotion or advancement in salary step, rank or seniority shall be determined on the basis of assessment reports drawn up according to the procedure laid down below, subject to the provisions of the present Act and the Turkish Armed Forces Personnel Act (Law no. 926). (a) The immediate superior competent to carry out assessment and draw up assessment reports for military judges, whether full or substitute members … shall be the Minister of State in the Ministry of Defence, followed by the Minister of Defence. …” Additional section 8 “Members … of the National Security Courts belonging to the Military Legal Service … shall be appointed by a committee composed of the personnel director and legal advisor of the General Staff, the personnel director and legal adviser attached to the staff of the arm in which the person concerned is serving and the Director of Military Judicial Affairs at the Ministry of Defence…” Section 16(1) and (3) “Military judges … shall be appointed by a decree issued jointly by the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister and submitted to the President of the Republic for approval, in accordance with the provisions on the appointment and transfer of members of the armed forces… … The procedure for appointment as a military judge shall take into account the opinion of the Court of Cassation, the reports by Ministry of Justice assessors and the assessment reports drawn up by the immediate superiors…” Section 18(1) “The rules governing the salary scales, salary increases and various personal rights of military judges … shall be as laid down in the provisions relating to officers.” Section 29 “The Minister of Defence may apply to military judges, after considering their defence submissions, the following disciplinary sanctions: A.A warning, which consists in giving the person concerned notice in writing that he must exercise more care in the performance of his duties. … B.A reprimand, which consists in giving the person concerned notice in writing that a particular act or a particular attitude has been found to be blameworthy. … The said sanctions shall be final, mentioned in the assessment record of the person concerned and entered in his personal file…” Section 38 “When military judges … sit in court they shall wear the special dress of their civilian counterparts…” 30.Article 112 of the Military Criminal Code of 22 May 1930 provides: “It shall be an offence, punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment, to abuse one’s authority as a [public] official in order to influence the military courts.” 31.Under section 22 of Law no. 1602 the First Division of the Supreme Military Administrative Court has jurisdiction to hear applications for judicial review and claims for damages based on disputes relating to the personal status of officers, particularly those concerning their promotion and professional advancement. 32.The Government produced several judgments of the First Division of the Supreme Military Administrative Court setting aside decisions concerning the appointment and promotion of military judges or disciplinary sanctions applied to them. These were the judgments of 31 May 1988 (no. 1988/185), 14 December 1993 (no. 1993/1116), 22 December 1993 (no. 1993/1119), 19 November 1996 (no. 1996/950), 1 April 1997 (no.1997/262), 27 May 1997 (no. 1997/405) and 3 July 1997 (no. 1997/62). It appears from these judgments that in setting aside the transfer decisions concerned, the First Division gave as its grounds either lack of consent on the part of the person concerned or abuse of the military authorities’ discretionary power. In connection with assessment reports, failure to state reasons or a lack of objectivity on the part of the immediate superior was taken into account. Lastly, in connection with a disciplinary sanction, against which in principle no appeal lies, the First Division held that the acts of which the person concerned stood accused had been incorrectly established and that the sanction was accordingly null and void. 33.The Government also submitted a number of judgments rendered by National Security Courts relevant to the impartiality of military judges sitting as members of such courts. These were the judgments of 12September 1995 (no. 1995/171), 27 February 1996 (no. 1996/38), 7March 1996 (no.1996/55), 21 March 1996 (no. 1996/70), 2 April 1996 (no.1996/102), 9April 1996 (no. 1996/112), 2 May 1996 (no. 1996/141), 9May 1996 (no.1996/150), 19 August 1996 (no. 1996/250), 12 September 1996 (no.1996/258), 19 September 1996 (no. 1996/263), 1 October 1996 (no.1996/270), 3 October 1996 (no. 1996/273), 8 October 1996 (no.1996/278), 12 June 1997 (no. 1997/128) and 15 July 1997 (no.1997/393). Most of these decisions declared the accused guilty but also contained separate opinions by military judges adopting a dissenting opinion with regard to the establishment and classification of the facts, the way sentence was determined or the finding of guilt itself.",1998,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

8,001-57980,Grand Chamber,"11. The applicant was arrested by police officers at 5.40 p.m. on 7January 1990 under section 14 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. Pursuant to Article 3 of the Criminal Evidence () Order 1988 (""the Order"") (see paragraph 27 below), he was cautioned by the police in the following terms: ""You do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so but I must warn you that if you fail to mention any fact which you rely on in your defence in court, your failure to take this opportunity to mention it may be treated in court as supporting any relevant evidence against you. If you do wish to say anything, what you say may be given in evidence."" In response to the police caution the applicant stated that he had nothing to say. 12. On arrival at Castlereagh Police Office at about 7 p.m., he refused to give his personal details to the officer in charge of the custody record. At 7.05 p.m. he was informed of his right to have a friend or relative notified of his detention and indicated that he did not require anyone to be so notified. At 7.06 p.m. he indicated that he wished to consult with a solicitor. At 7.30p.m. his access to a solicitor was delayed on the authority of a detective superintendent pursuant to section 15 (1) of the (Emergency Provisions) Act 1987 (""the 1987 Act""). The delay was authorised for a period of 48 hours from the time of detention (i.e. from 5.40p.m. on 7 January) on the basis that the detective superintendent had reasonable grounds to believe that the exercise of the right of access would, inter alia, interfere with the gathering of information about the commission of acts of terrorism or make it more difficult to prevent an act of terrorism (see paragraph 33 below). 13. At 9.27 p.m. on 7 January a police constable cautioned the applicant pursuant to Article 6 of the Order, inter alia, requesting him to account for his presence at the house where he was arrested. He was warned that if he failed or refused to do so, a court, judge or jury might draw such inference from his failure or refusal as appears proper. He was also served with a written copy of Article 6 of the Order (see paragraph 27 below). In reply to this caution the applicant stated: ""Nothing to say."" 14. At 10.40 p.m. he was reminded of his right to have a friend or relative notified of his detention and stated that he did not want anyone notified. He was also informed that his right of access to a solicitor had been delayed. He then requested consultation with a different firm of solicitors. A police inspector reviewed the reasons for the delay and concluded that the reasons remained valid. 15. The applicant was interviewed by police detectives at Castlereagh Police Office on twelve occasions during 8 and 9 January. In total he was interviewed for 21 hours and 39 minutes. At the commencement of these interviews he was either cautioned pursuant to Article 3 of the Order or reminded of the terms of the caution. 16. During the first ten interviews on 8 and 9 January 1990 the applicant made no reply to any questions put to him. He was able to see his solicitor for the first time at 6.33 p.m. on 9 January. At 7.10 p.m. he was interviewed again and reminded of the Article 3 caution. He replied: ""I have been advised by my solicitor not to answer any of your questions."" A final interview, during which the applicant said nothing, took place between 9.40 p.m. and 11.45 p.m. on 9 January. His solicitor was not permitted to be present at any of these interviews. 17. In May 1991 the applicant was tried by a single judge, the Lord Chief Justice of , sitting without a jury, for the offences of conspiracy to murder, the unlawful imprisonment, with seven other people, of a certain Mr L. and of belonging to a proscribed organisation, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). 18. According to the Crown, Mr L. had been a member of the IRA who had been providing information about their activities to the Royal Ulster Constabulary. On discovering that Mr L. was an informer, the IRA tricked him into visiting a house in on 5 January 1990. He was falsely imprisoned in one of the rear bedrooms of the house and interrogated by the IRA until the arrival of the police and the army at the house on 7 January 1990. It was also alleged by the Crown that there was a conspiracy to murder Mr L. as punishment for being a police informer. 19. In the course of the trial, evidence was given that when the police entered the house on 7 January, the applicant was seen by a police constable coming down a flight of stairs wearing a raincoat over his clothes and was arrested in the hall of the house. Mr L. testified that he was forced under threat of being killed to make a taped confession to his captors that he was an informer. He further said that on the evening of 7 January he had heard scurrying and had been told to take off his blindfold, that he had done so and had opened the spare bedroom door. He had then seen the applicant standing at the stairs. The applicant had told him that the police were at the door and to go downstairs and watch television. While he was talking to him the applicant was pulling tape out of a cassette. On a search of the house by the police items of clothing of Mr L. were subsequently found in the spare bedroom, whilst a tangled tape was discovered in the upstairs bathroom. The salvaged portions of the tape revealed a confession by Mr L. that he had agreed to work for the police and had been paid for so doing. At no time, either on his arrest or during the trial proceedings, did the applicant give any explanation for his presence in the house. 20. At the close of the prosecution case the trial judge, acting in accordance with Article 4 of the Order, called upon each of the eight accused to give evidence in their own defence. The trial judge informed them inter alia: ""I am also required by law to tell you that if you refuse to come into the witness box to be sworn or if, after having been sworn, you refuse, without good reason, to answer any question, then the court in deciding whether you are guilty or not guilty may take into account against you to the extent that it considers proper your refusal to give evidence or to answer any questions."" 21. Acting on the advice of his solicitor and counsel, the applicant chose not to give any evidence. No witnesses were called on his behalf. Counsel, with support from the evidence of a co-accused, D.M., submitted, inter alia, that the applicant’s presence in the house just before the police arrived was recent and innocent. 22. On 8 May 1991 the applicant was found guilty of the offence of aiding and abetting the unlawful imprisonment of Mr L. and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. He was acquitted on the remaining charges. 23. The trial judge rejected D.M.’s evidence (see paragraph 21 above) as untruthful. He considered that ""the surrounding facts, including the finding of the tangled tape in the bathroom with the broken cassette case, and the fact that, on entering the house some appreciable time after they arrived outside it and some appreciable time after they first knocked on the door, the police found Murray coming down the stairs at the time when all the other occupants of the house were in the living room, strongly confirm L’s evidence that after the police knocked on the door Murray was upstairs pulling the tape out of the cassette"". 24. In rejecting a submission by the applicant that Articles 4 and 6 of the Order did not operate to permit the court to draw an adverse inference against him, where, at the end of the Crown case, there was a reasonably plausible explanation for the accused’s conduct consistent with his innocence, the trial judge stated as follows: ""There can be debate as to the extent to which, before the making of the Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1988, a tribunal of fact in this jurisdiction was entitled to draw an adverse inference against an accused because he failed to give evidence on his own behalf, or to account for his presence at a particular place or to mention particular facts when questioned by the police. But I consider that the purpose of Article 4 and of Articles 3 and 6 of the 1988 Order was to make it clear that, whatever was the effect of the previous legal rules, a judge trying a criminal case without a jury, or a jury in a criminal case, was entitled to apply common sense in drawing inferences against the accused in the circumstances specified in Article 4, and in Articles 3 and 6 ... ... I think it is clear that the purpose of Article 4 is to permit the tribunal of fact to draw such inferences against the accused from his failure to give evidence in his own defence as common sense requires. The inference which it is proper to draw against an accused will vary from case to case depending on the particular circumstances of the case and, of course, the failure of the accused to give evidence on his own behalf does not in itself indicate guilt. Nor does the failure to mention particular facts when questioned or the failure to account for presence in a particular place in itself indicate guilt. But I consider that the intendment of ... Article 4 and Article 6 is to enable the tribunal of fact to exercise ordinary common sense in drawing inferences against an accused ... Therefore when I come to consider the case against the accused ... I propose to draw such inferences against [him] under Article 4 and under Article 6 as ordinary common sense dictates."" 25. In concluding that the applicant was guilty of the offence of aiding and abetting false imprisonment, the trial judge drew adverse inferences against the applicant under both Articles 4 and 6 of the Order. The judge stated that in the particular circumstances of the case he did not propose to draw inferences against the applicant under Article 3 of the Order. He stated furthermore: ""I accept the submissions of counsel for the accused that as demonstrated by his replies in cross-examination, L. is a man who is fully prepared to lie on oath to advance his own interests and is a man of no moral worth whatever. I, therefore, accept the further submissions of counsel for the accused that, unless his evidence were confirmed by other evidence, a court should not act on his evidence, particularly against accused persons in a criminal trial ... I now turn to consider the fifth count charging the false imprisonment of L. against the accused [the applicant]. For the reasons which I have already stated, I am satisfied that, as L. described in his evidence, [the applicant] was at the top of the stairs pulling the tape out of the cassette after the police arrived outside the house. I am also satisfied, for the reasons which I have already stated, that [the applicant] was in the house for longer than the short period described by his co-accused, [D.M.]. I am further satisfied that it is an irresistible inference that while he was in the house [the applicant] was in contact with the men holding L. captive and that he knew that L. was being held a captive. I also draw very strong inferences against [the applicant] under Article 6 of the 1988 Order by reason of his failure to give an account of his presence in the house when cautioned by the police on the evening of 7 January 1990 under Article 6, and I also draw very strong inferences against [the applicant] under Article 4 of the 1988 Order by reason of his refusal to give evidence in his own defence when called upon by the Court to do so. Therefore I find [the applicant] guilty of aiding and abetting the false imprisonment of L. because, knowing he was being held captive in the house, he was present in the house concurring in L. being falsely imprisoned. As Vaughan J. stated in R. v. Young ... [the applicant] was ‘near enough to give [his] aid and to give [his] countenance and assistance’."" 26. The applicant appealed against conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeal in . In a judgment of 7 July 1992, the court dismissed the applicant’s appeal holding, inter alia: ""... to suggest, with respect, that [the applicant] went into the house just as the police were arriving outside, immediately went upstairs, attempted to destroy a tape and then walked downstairs, and that this was the sum of his time and activity in the house defies common sense ... We are satisfied that it can reasonably be inferred that [the applicant] knew before he came to the house that [L.] was being held captive there. With this knowledge he assisted in the false imprisonment by directing the captive from the bedroom where he had been held and by giving him the directions and admonition [L.] said. Accordingly [the applicant] aided and abetted the crime. We do not accept that [L.] would have been free to leave the house, if the police and army had been taken in by the pretence of the television watching and had departed without making any arrests. We have no doubt that [L.] remained under restraint in the living room when the police were there and if they had left, he would have remained a prisoner to await the fate that his captors would determine. We consider that there was a formidable case against [the applicant]. He was the only one of the accused whom [L.] observed and identified as playing a positive part in the activities touching his captivity. [L.]’s evidence therefore called for an answer. No answer was forthcoming of any kind to the police or throughout the length of his trial. It was inevitable that the judge would draw ‘very strong inferences’ against him. The Crown case deeply implicated [the applicant] in the false imprisonment of [L.]."" 27. The 1988 Order includes the following provisions: Article 2 (4) and (7) ""(4) A person shall not be committed for trial, have a case to answer or be convicted of an offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure or refusal as is mentioned in Article 3 (2), 4 (4), 5 (2) or 6 (2). ... (7) Nothing in this Order prejudices any power of a court, in any proceedings, to exclude evidence (whether by preventing questions from being put or otherwise) at its discretion."" Article 3 ""Circumstances in which inferences may be drawn from accused’s failure to mention particular facts when questioned, charged, etc. (1) Where, in any proceedings against a person for an offence, evidence is given that the accused (3) Subject to any directions by the court, evidence tending to establish the failure may be given before or after evidence tending to establish the fact which the accused is alleged to have failed to mention. ..."" Article 4 ""Accused to be called upon to give evidence at trial (1) At the trial of any person (other than a child) for an offence paragraphs (2) to (7) apply unless (2) Before any evidence is called for the defence, the court (3) If the accused or (4) The court or jury, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may (5) This Article does not render the accused compellable to give evidence on his own behalf, and he shall accordingly not be guilty of contempt of court by reason of a refusal to be sworn. ..."" Article 6 ""Inferences from failure or refusal to account for presence at a particular place (1) Where (2) Where this paragraph applies (3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply unless the accused was told in ordinary language by the constable when making the request mentioned in paragraph (1) (c) what the effect of this Article would be if he failed or refused to do so. (4) This Article does not preclude the drawing of any inference from the failure or refusal of a person to account for his presence at a place which could properly be drawn apart from this Article. ..."" 28. In the case of R. v. Kevin Sean Murray (sub nom. v.Director of Public Prosecutions), the House of Lords considered the effect of Article 4 of the Order ([1993] 97 Criminal Appeal Reports 151). In the leading judgment of the House of Lords, Lord Slynn stated that: 29. He added: ""... This does not mean that the court can conclude simply because the accused does not give evidence that he is guilty. In the first place the prosecutor must establish a prima facie case - a case for him to answer. In the second place in determining whether the accused is guilty the judge or jury can draw only ‘such inference from the refusal as appear proper’. As Lord Diplock said in Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor at p. 153B: There must thus be some basis derived from the circumstances which justify the inference. If there is no prima facie case shown by the prosecution there is no case to answer. Equally if parts of the prosecution had so little evidential value that they called for no answer, a failure to deal with those specific matters cannot justify an inference of guilt. On the other hand if aspects of the evidence taken alone or in combination with other facts clearly call for an explanation which the accused ought to be in a position to give, if an explanation exists, then a failure to give any explanation may as a matter of common sense allow the drawing of an inference that there is no explanation and that the accused is guilty ..."" 30. Lord Mustill in R. v. Kevin Sean Murray (cited above) stated that the expression ""a prima facie case"" ""was intended to denote a case which is strong enough to go to a jury - i.e. a case consisting of direct evidence which, if believed and combined with legitimate inferences based upon it, could lead a properly directed jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt ... that each of the essential elements of the offence is proved"". 31. Even if a prima facie case is established, the trial judge has a discretion whether or not to draw inferences on the facts of the particular case. In the present case, the Court of Appeal indicated that if a judge accepted that an accused did not understand the warning given in the caution required by Article 6 or if he had doubts about it ""we are confident that he would not activate Article 6 against him"". 32. In R. v. Director of Serious Fraud Office, ex parte Smith [1992] 3 Weekly Law Reports 66, Lord Mustill stated that it was necessary to analyse which aspect of the right to silence is involved in any particular situation, because ""... In truth it does not denote any single right, but rather refers to a disparate group of immunities, which differ in nature, origin, incidence and importance, and also as to the extent to which they have already been encroached upon by statute."" Amongst the group of immunities which were covered by the expression ""right to silence"" Lord Mustill identified the following: ""(1) A general immunity, possessed by all persons and bodies, from being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions posed by other persons or bodies. (2) A general immunity, possessed by all persons and bodies, from being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions the answers to which may incriminate them. (3) A specific immunity, possessed by all persons under suspicion of criminal responsibility whilst being interviewed by police officers or others in similar positions of authority, from being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions of any kind. (4) A specific immunity, possessed by accused persons undergoing trial, from being compelled to give evidence, and from being compelled to answer questions put to them in the dock. (5) A specific immunity, possessed by persons who have been charged with a criminal offence, from having questions material to the offence addressed to them by police officers or persons in a similar position of authority. (6) A specific immunity ..., possessed by accused persons undergoing trial, from having adverse comment made on any failure (a) to answer questions before the trial, or (b) to give evidence at the trial."" 33. Section 15 of the (Emergency Provisions) Act 1987 provides as relevant: ""15. Right of access to legal advice (1) A person who is detained under the terrorism provisions and is being held in police custody shall be entitled, if he so requests, to consult a solicitor privately. (2) A person shall be informed of the right conferred on him by subsection (1) as soon as practicable after he has become a person to whom the subsection applies. (3) A request made by a person under subsection (1), and the time at which it is made, shall be recorded in writing unless it is made by him while at a court and being charged with an offence. (4) If a person makes such a request, he must be permitted to consult a solicitor as soon as practicable except to the extent that any delay is permitted by this section. ... (8) An officer may only authorise a delay in complying with a request under subsection (1) where he has reasonable grounds for believing that the exercise of the right conferred by that subsection at the time when the detained person desires to exercise it - 34. The delay must be authorised by a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent (section 15, subsection (5) (a)) and the detained person must be told the reason for the delay (subsection (9) (a)). The maximum delay is 48 hours. 35. The courts in have taken the view that the provisions of the 1988 Order should not be read subject to section 15 of the 1987 Act above. In the case of R. v. Dermot Quinn (judgment of the Belfast Crown Court of 23 December 1991), the trial judge rejected a submission to the effect that an adverse inference under Article 3 of the 1988 Order should not be drawn where the accused had asked for access to his solicitor but been interviewed by the police before his solicitor arrived to advise him. He noted that the 1988 Order had come into force after section 15 of the 1987 Act and considered that Parliament had not intended that an inference dictated by common sense which was permitted by Article 3 of the 1988 Order should not be drawn because of the right to access to legal advice given by section 15. In its judgment of 17 September 1993, the Court of Appeal in upheld the trial judge’s ruling, finding no unfairness in the circumstances of the case in drawing an adverse inference in respect of the accused’s failure to respond to questions by the police before the receipt of legal advice from his solicitor. The court commented that a breach of section 15 might in certain circumstances allow the trial judge in his discretion to refuse to draw an adverse inference under Article 3 of the 1988 Order.",1996,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

24,001-122859,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Scarborough. A.The criminal conviction 10.On 7 September 2000 the applicant was convicted by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court of the manslaughter of her four-month-old son, Patrick. She was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. 10.On 7 September 2000 the applicant was convicted by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court of the manslaughter of her four-month-old son, Patrick. She was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. 11.Evidence was given at her trial by expert medical witnesses who described how the injuries suffered by her son were consistent with shaking or an impact. The conviction was based on the accepted hypothesis concerning “shaken baby syndrome”, also known as “non-accidental head injury” (NAHI), to the effect that the finding of a triad of intracranial injuries consisting of encephalopathy, subdural haemorrhages and retinal haemorrhages were either diagnostic of, or at least very strongly suggestive of, the use of unlawful force. All three were present in the case of the death of the applicant’s son. 12.The applicant did not, immediately after her trial, appeal against her conviction. B.The quashing of the conviction 13.Following a review by the authorities of cases in which expert medical evidence had been relied upon, the applicant applied for, and was granted, leave to appeal out of time. The appeal was founded on a challenge to the accepted hypothesis concerning NAHI on the basis that new medical evidence suggested that the triad of injuries could be attributed to a cause other than NAH 13.Following a review by the authorities of cases in which expert medical evidence had been relied upon, the applicant applied for, and was granted, leave to appeal out of time.

On 21 July 2005 the court quashed the applicant’s conviction on the ground that it was unsafe. 16.As to its role in reviewing the evidence on appeal, the court noted: “70.... [O]n general issues of this nature, where there is a genuine difference between two reputable medical opinions, in our judgment, the Court of Criminal Appeal will not usually be the appropriate forum for these issues to be resolved. The focus of this Court will be (as ours has been) to decide the safety of the conviction bearing in mind the test in fresh evidence appeals which we set out below. That is not to say that such differences cannot be resolved at trial. At trial, when such issues arise, it will be for the jury (in a criminal trial) and the judge (in a civil trial) to resolve them as issues of fact on all the available evidence in the case ...” “70....

It also noted that, the case being of some difficulty, it was important to bear in mind the test set out by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in R v. Pendleton (see paragraph 47 below) of asking whether the evidence, if given at the trial, might reasonably have affected the decision of the trial jury to convict. It continued: “143.... [T]he evidence at trial and the evidence adduced by the Crown in this appeal, provide a strong case against [the applicant]. [Counsel for the Crown’s] submission that the triad is established and that any attempt to undermine it is based on speculation is a powerful one. Nevertheless strong as is the case against [the applicant] we have concerns about the safety of the conviction.” “143.... [T]he evidence at trial and the evidence adduced by the Crown in this appeal, provide a strong case against [the applicant]. [Counsel for the Crown’s] submission that the triad is established and that any attempt to undermine it is based on speculation is a powerful one. Nevertheless strong as is the case against [the applicant] we have concerns about the safety of the conviction.” 18.The court reviewed the medical evidence of the experts on behalf of the applicant and the Crown, noting the differences between their views, and found: “144.First, in order to dismiss the appeal, we would have to accede to [counsel for the Crown’s] submission that we should reject [expert for the applicant] Dr Squier’s evidence in its entirety ... 145.... We are far from saying that we accept Dr Squier’s evidence in preference to that of Dr Rorke-Adams [expert for the Crown]. Indeed, in view of the weight of evidence disputing her opinions we have reservations about whether Dr Squier can be right. But equally, in all the circumstances of this case, the differences between them are ones which the jury would have had to have assessed in the light of all the evidence in the case. 146.Secondly, although the evidence of the findings of retinal haemorrhages is powerful supporting evidence of shaking, on its own it is not diagnostic of shaking. If the subdural haemorrhages are undermined, the retinal haemorrhages findings will not fill the gap although we recognise that both can be considered together. There is also the issue of whether Dr Adams [for the applicant] may be correct in her view that fixed and dilated pupils seen by the ambulance crew was a sign of brain swelling at that time. 147.Thirdly, although as we have already stated the amount of force required to cause the triad of injuries will in most cases be more than just rough handling, the evidence suggests that there will be rare cases when injuries will not correspond to the amount of force used. It is at least possible that in such rare cases (maybe very rare cases) very little force will cause catastrophic injuries.” 147.Thirdly, although as we have already stated the amount of force required to cause the triad of injuries will in most cases be more than just rough handling, the evidence suggests that there will be rare cases when injuries will not correspond to the amount of force used. It is at least possible that in such rare cases (maybe very rare cases) very little force will cause catastrophic injuries.” 19.Emphasising the importance of the clinical evidence in the case, the court continued: “150.... In summary, [the applicant] was described as a careful and caring mother. She called out Dr Barber late at night because of her concerns for Patrick. Dr Barber described her as being calm and controlled at that time. The prosecution’s case at trial was that in the interval between Dr Barber leaving the house and 2.30am when [the applicant] telephoned the emergency services she must have violently and unlawfully shaken Patrick. In our judgment this history combined with the absence of findings of bruises to any part of the head, face or body; and the absence of fractures or any other sign apart from the triad of injuries, does not fit easily with the Crown’s case of an unlawful assault based on the triad of injuries, itself a hypothesis.” “150....

We are conscious that the witnesses called on behalf of [the applicant] have not identified to our satisfaction a specific alternative cause of Patrick’s injuries. But, in this appeal the triad stands alone and in our judgment the clinical evidence points away from NAH Here the triad itself may be uncertain for the reasons already expressed. In any event, on our view of the evidence in these appeals, the mere presence of the triad on its own cannot automatically or necessarily lead to a diagnosis of NAH 153.The central issue at trial was whether [the applicant] caused the death of her son, Patrick, by the use of unlawful force. We ask ourselves whether the fresh evidence, which we have heard as to the cause of death and the amount of force necessary to cause the triad, might reasonably have affected the jury’s decision to convict. For all the reasons referred to we have concluded that it might. Accordingly the conviction is unsafe and this appeal must be allowed. The conviction will be quashed.” 153.The central issue at trial was whether [the applicant] caused the death of her son, Patrick, by the use of unlawful force.

The letter noted: “The Home Secretary is of the opinion that your client does not fulfil the statutory requirements of Section 133(1) of the Act because the medical evidence considered by the Court of Appeal did not disclose a new fact ... The Home Secretary’s view is that this new medical evidence about the degree of force required to cause a triad of injuries is not a new or newly discovered fact; rather it shows the changing medical opinion about the degree of force needed to cause a triad and is properly categorised as new evidence of facts known all along rather than new facts.”>The High Court judgment 24.The applicant subsequently brought judicial review proceedings challenging the decision to refuse to pay her compensation under section133 of the 1988 Act. She contended that she met the criteria for compensation set out in that section. 24.The applicant subsequently brought judicial review proceedings challenging the decision to refuse to pay her compensation under section133 of the 1988 Act. She contended that she met the criteria for compensation set out in that section. 25.The claim was dismissed by the High Court on 10 December 2007. The judge began by considering the approach of the CACD in quashing the applicant’s conviction, drawing the following conclusions: “21.... (1) [T]he court applied the Pendleton test and did not decide for itself the complex medical issues raised by the evidence which it heard; (2) all that it decided was that the evidence which it had heard could, if accepted by the jury, have led a jury to acquit the claimant; (3) notwithstanding that conclusion, the court was of the opinion that the Crown’s case was a strong one. I do not understand that conclusion to be consistent with the proposition that at the conclusion of a new trial, on that evidence, a trial judge would have been obliged to direct the jury to acquit the claimant; (4) the material considered by the Court of Appeal which led to its conclusion was a complex mixture of fact and opinion.” “21....

He continued: “29.The interpretation of Section 133 was considered by the House of Lords in R(on the application of Mullen) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [[2004] UKHL 18, see paragraphs 54-62 below]. There was a well known divergence of view between Lord Bingham and Lord Steyn. The facts of the case are far removed from the present case and the ratio decidendi of the decision does not assist in the resolution of this claim. It was simply that because the ground upon which Mullen’s conviction was quashed did not relate to the investigation or the conduct of the trial or the evidence led at it, so he was not entitled to compensation under Section 133. It was a striking feature of this case that at no stage did he maintain that he was in fact innocent of the crime of which he had been convicted.” “29.The interpretation of Section 133 was considered by the House of Lords in R(on the application of Mullen) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [[2004] UKHL 18, see paragraphs 54-62 below].

It was a striking feature of this case that at no stage did he maintain that he was in fact innocent of the crime of which he had been convicted.” 28.The judge accepted that the ground on which compensation had been refused by the Secretary of State disclosed an excessively narrow view of what was a new or newly discovered fact. He considered that the distinction between medical opinion and fact was exceptionally hard to draw and that it would be seriously unjust to a claimant to refuse a claim for compensation merely because the claim was based upon a change in medical opinion as well as in clinical findings. However, that finding was not determinative of the applicant’s claim, as there was no point in sending it back to the Secretary of State for reconsideration if he was bound to reach the same decision on the compensation application for a different reason. 28.The judge accepted that the ground on which compensation had been refused by the Secretary of State disclosed an excessively narrow view of what was a new or newly discovered fact.

However, that finding was not determinative of the applicant’s claim, as there was no point in sending it back to the Secretary of State for reconsideration if he was bound to reach the same decision on the compensation application for a different reason. 29.The judge recorded the submission of counsel for the applicant that it was not necessary for her to show that she was innocent of the charge of which she had been convicted; and his concession that it was not arguable before the High Court that if all the applicant could show was that there was a doubt about guilt which could or should have led a jury to acquit, the claim for compensation should be allowed. The judge considered this concession inevitable and right in principle in the light of observations made by the Lord Chief Justice in the case of R (on the application of Clibery) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] EWHC 1855 (Admin), which he cited as follows: “41.... Lord Bingham [in R(Mullen)] ... considered two different situations, each of which he considered fell within the description of ‘miscarriage of justice’ in Section133 of the 1988 Act. The first is where new facts demonstrate that the claimant was innocent of the offence of which he was convicted. In such circumstances, it is possible to say that if the facts in question had been before the jury, he would not have been convicted. The second is where there are acts or omissions in the course of the trial which should not have occurred and which so infringed his right to a fair trial that it is possible to say that he was ‘wrongly convicted’. In such circumstances it is appropriate to say that the claimant should not have been convicted.” “41....

In such circumstances it is appropriate to say that the claimant should not have been convicted.” 30.The judge continued: “42.Mr Southey [for the applicant] has not addressed me on the Strasbourg learning on the presumption of innocence. I make no decision by reference to that. He reserves his position on that for another day. Subject to that it seems to me to be outwith the statutory language to describe a case in which a jury might have reached a different conclusion as showing ‘beyond reasonable doubt that there has been a miscarriage of justice’. Lord Bingham’s observations about miscarriages of process seem to me to have no bearing on evidential miscarriage of justice cases. In evidential miscarriage of justice cases what is required is that the new or newly discovered fact must show beyond a reasonable doubt that there has been a miscarriage of justice. That is not shown where all that is established is that, if new evidence had been available, a properly directed jury might have reached a different conclusion.” “42.Mr Southey [for the applicant] has not addressed me on the Strasbourg learning on the presumption of innocence.

If the evidence of the sole witness were subsequently shown to be wholly wrong, whether due to improper motive by the witness or simply by mistake, it is at the least arguable that there would have been in that claimant’s case a miscarriage of justice even though nobody would ever have decided, and indeed might never know, whether the defendant was in fact guilty of the charge. But that proposition cannot avail this claimant. For – as the recital of the medical evidence heard by the Court of Appeal and by the trial jury demonstrates – there was powerful evidence against this claimant. At the conclusion of the prosecution case or indeed at the conclusion of all the evidence, on the view of the Court of Appeal expressly stated, it would have been for the jury to determine the issue. ...” “44.Take a case in which a defendant gives no account at interview or at trial – and in which the only evidence against him is that of a single witness – who is convicted on the basis of that evidence together with the supporting evidence of his own silence.

That falls well short of demonstrating beyond reasonable doubt that there had been a miscarriage of justice in this case. Accordingly and for that simple reason, I dismiss this claim.”>The Court of Appeal judgment 33.The applicant appealed. On 15 July 2008 the Court of Appeal Civil Division dismissed the appeal. Giving judgment for the court, LordJustice Hughes began by summarising the approach of the CACD in quashing the applicant’s conviction. He referred to the conclusions expressed in the CACD judgment, to the effect that although there remained a strong case against the applicant the court had concerns about the safety of the conviction. He continued: “17.... The decision as to the safety of a conviction in a fresh evidence case is for the court itself and is not what effect the fresh evidence would have on the mind of a jury, but in a difficult case the court may find it helpful to test its provisional view by asking whether the evidence now available might reasonably have affected the decision of the trial jury to convict. In the present case it is clear that the CACD adopted this latter approach and relied significantly for its decision on what might have been the impact of the medical evidence which it had heard if such evidence had been available to the jury ... [T]here can be no doubt that the court regarded the proper interpretation of the clinical findings in this case as a matter which it ought not itself to resolve, but rather as one which could and should be resolved by a jury on hearing the competing expert opinions. Adopting that approach, it decided that the evidence which was now available might, if it had been heard by the jury, have led to a different result.” “17....

Adopting that approach, it decided that the evidence which was now available might, if it had been heard by the jury, have led to a different result.” 34.As to the decision of the CACD not to order a retrial, the judge commented: “18.... [B]y the time of the appeal the appellant had served her sentence and a great deal of time had passed. Understandably, in those circumstances, there was no application by the Crown for a re-trial, as there would no doubt have been had the conviction been quashed for these reasons shortly after trial.” “18....

Understandably, in those circumstances, there was no application by the Crown for a re-trial, as there would no doubt have been had the conviction been quashed for these reasons shortly after trial.” 35.The judge considered the meaning of “miscarriage of justice” and summarised the difference of approach between Lord Bingham and LordSteyn in R(Mullen) as follows: “21.... Lord Steyn held ... that in this context ‘miscarriage of justice’ means that the innocence of the defendant is acknowledged. Lord Bingham ... expressed no concluded opinion on this question, but made it clear that he ‘hesitated to accept’ this interpretation. For his part, he was ready to accept that ‘miscarriage of justice’ extended in this context to serious failures of the trial process, whether or not innocence was demonstrated. ...” “21.... Lord Steyn held ... that in this context ‘miscarriage of justice’ means that the innocence of the defendant is acknowledged. Lord Bingham ... expressed no concluded opinion on this question, but made it clear that he ‘hesitated to accept’ this interpretation. For his part, he was ready to accept that ‘miscarriage of justice’ extended in this context to serious failures of the trial process, whether or not innocence was demonstrated. ...” 36.However, he explained that given the unanimous view of the House of Lords that Mr Mullen’s claim failed, the different interpretations of Lord Steyn and Lord Bingham were not strictly necessary to the decision. 36.However, he explained that given the unanimous view of the House of Lords that Mr Mullen’s claim failed, the different interpretations of Lord Steyn and Lord Bingham were not strictly necessary to the decision. 37.The judge noted that counsel for the applicant accepted that the applicant’s innocence had not been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt, or conclusively, by the decision of the CACD to quash the conviction. He therefore observed that if Lord Steyn’s interpretation of section 133 of the 1988 Act was correct, the applicant’s claim failed. However, the applicant’s submission was that Lord Bingham’s approach should be adopted and that on this interpretation, her claim succeeded because something went seriously wrong with the trial process in her case. Reviewing Lord Bingham’s comment in R(Mullen), the judge noted: “26.... [I]t is plain that the critical feature of the extended interpretation of ‘miscarriage of justice’ which [Lord Bingham] was prepared to contemplate is that ‘something has gone seriously wrong in ... the conduct of the trial’ ...” “26.... [I]t is plain that the critical feature of the extended interpretation of ‘miscarriage of justice’ which [Lord Bingham] was prepared to contemplate is that ‘something has gone seriously wrong in ... the conduct of the trial’ ...” 38.The judge continued: “27.In the present case there was nothing which went wrong with the conduct of the trial, whether seriously or otherwise. In speaking of ‘flawed expert evidence’ it is clear that Lord Bingham cannot have been contemplating evidence which was conscientiously given and based upon sound expertise at the time of trial. The most that could be said against the expert evidence given at this trial is that it might need adjustment in the light of new medical research and/or thinking. In any event, the medical evidence given at time of trial has not been demonstrated to be flawed, even in this limited sense. As the passages from the judgment of the CACD which I have cited show, this court’s decision went no further than to say that the differences of medical opinion needed to be resolved by a jury. Nor was this a case in which the jury was presented with a medical consensus that the triad was diagnostic of unlawful killing. The medical evidence called for the appellant accepted that it was consistent with unlawful killing but disputed that it necessarily led to that conclusion. The appeal was allowed because over the intervening years more possible force had emerged for the opinion voiced on the appellant’s behalf and now supported by Dr Squier’s evidence, which the jury had not heard and which the CACD, despite plain doubts about it, was not in a position wholly to dismiss. 28.For the same reasons, I have no doubt that the decision of the CACD does not begin to carry the implication that there was no case for the appellant to answer once the fresh evidence was available. ...” 28.For the same reasons, I have no doubt that the decision of the CACD does not begin to carry the implication that there was no case for the appellant to answer once the fresh evidence was available. ...” 39.The judge went on to discuss the situations in which a disagreement between distinguished experts would lead to the conclusion that it would be unwise or unsafe to proceed with the trial. He noted that there was no authority to suggest that where experts disagreed as to the conclusions which could be drawn from the injuries, the case ought to be withdrawn from the jury. On the contrary he considered that the resolution of such disagreements, bearing in mind the criminal standard of proof, was an important part of the functions of a jury. He therefore concluded: “29.In the present case, there was no basis for saying that, on the new evidence, there was no case to go to a jury. Moreover, if the court had meant to say that there was (now) no case to answer, it would have said so in plain terms. On the contrary, its oft-repeated statements that the evaluation of the rival medical opinions would be a matter for the jury are wholly inconsistent with a finding that there was no case to answer on the new state of medical evidence. Likewise, the posing of the Pendleton question by way of check is inconsistent with a finding that the case should never have reached the jury if the fresh evidence had been known. 30.In those circumstances, I reach the clear conclusion that, even on the interpretation of section 133 which Lord Bingham favoured, this case cannot succeed. ...” 30.In those circumstances, I reach the clear conclusion that, even on the interpretation of section 133 which Lord Bingham favoured, this case cannot succeed. ...” 40.Although in the circumstances it was not necessary to resolve the difference of construction of section 133 articulated by Lord Bingham and Lord Steyn, the judge nonetheless expressed a preference for Lord Steyn’s approach, noting, inter alia: “40.iii)Whilst I agree of course that the CACD does not ordinarily address the question of guilt or innocence, but only the safety of the conviction, those cases where the innocence of the convicted defendant is genuinely demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt by new or newly discovered fact will be identifiable in that court and the judgment will, in virtually every case, make plain that this is so ... [I]t seems to me [that] the operation of the section poses very real difficulties if the broader definition [of miscarriage of justice] is adopted, for then it becomes necessary to ask in every case of conviction quashed on grounds of fresh evidence whether it satisfies the section 133 criterion of miscarriage proved beyond reasonable doubt or is merely a case of doubt raised to the extent that the conviction is unsafe. If, however, miscarriage of justice means the establishment of innocence beyond reasonable doubt, there will usually be no difficulty in those cases being apparent from the judgments of the CACD.” “40.iii)Whilst I agree of course that the CACD does not ordinarily address the question of guilt or innocence, but only the safety of the conviction, those cases where the innocence of the convicted defendant is genuinely demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt by new or newly discovered fact will be identifiable in that court and the judgment will, in virtually every case, make plain that this is so ...

If, however, miscarriage of justice means the establishment of innocence beyond reasonable doubt, there will usually be no difficulty in those cases being apparent from the judgments of the CACD.” 41.As regards the applicant’s submissions based on the presumption of innocence, the judge referred to the Court’s judgments in Sekanina v. Austria, 25 August 1993, Series A no. 266A; Rushiti v. Austria, no.28389/95, 21 March 2000; Weixelbraun v. Austria, no. 33730/96, 20December 2001; O. v. Norway, no. 29327/95, ECHR 2003II; and Hammern v. Norway, no. 30287/96, 11 February 2003. He found that they did not lead to the conclusion that the applicant was entitled to compensation under section 133, for the following reasons: “35.... i)None of these cases considered the ICCPR [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 – see paragraph 65 below] scheme for payment of compensation for conclusively proved miscarriage of justice, which is what is in issue here. ii)Article 14 of the ICCPR juxtaposes within it both the provision for compensation in article 14(6), now under consideration, and, in article 14(2), a provision in terms identical to article 6(2) ECHR. Yet by article 14(6) it plainly requires something more than the quashing of the conviction before the right to compensation arises, namely that a miscarriage of justice be conclusively demonstrated by new or newly discovered facts. It does not seem to me that these provisions could co-exist in these terms if the consequence of article 14(2) was that nothing more could be required for compensation beyond the quashing of the conviction on the basis of new fact. ... iii)Whilst the ICCPR is a treaty independent of the European Convention, provisions identical to article 14(6) are to be found in Protocol 7 to the ECHR, article3. For the same reasons, it is inconceivable that article 3 could be in the terms it is if article 6(2) of the main Convention meant that compensation necessarily followed the quashing of a conviction on the basis of fresh evidence. iv)As Lord Steyn pointed out in Mullen ..., the distinction between the Austrian domestic scheme then under consideration and the international scheme under Protocol 7 article 3 was one to which the Strasbourg Court carefully drew attention in Sekanina ... at paragraph 25 ... v)It is plain from the Austrian and Norwegian cases that the line between the application and non-application of article 6(2) is frequently a fine one. In Sekanina the Commission ... expressly stated that article 6(2) ‘naturally’ does not prevent the same facts being relied upon, post acquittal on the merits, to found a civil claim against the defendant, and this must occur routinely, as also must subsequent child care cases. Yet in Orr v. Norway (no. 31283/04, 15 May 2008) the Court held that article 6(2) disabled the complainant in a rape case from recovering compensation post acquittal notwithstanding the different standard of proof attributable to the civil claim; the decision was grounded upon the manner in which the court expressed itself in dealing with the latter question. vi)The basis for the decisions in the Austrian and Norwegian cases was the closeness of the link between the decision to acquit on the merits and the decision as to compensation. In the Austrian cases the compensation decision was within the jurisdiction of the criminal court, albeit it was usually made by a differently constituted criminal court some time after the acquittal, as for example a confiscation order may be in . Moreover, the court proceeded in part by analysing the decision of the trial jury. In the Norwegian cases the acquittal was made by a court composed of judges and jury, and the same judges went on more or less immediately to consider compensation. ... vii)By contrast, compensation in a fresh evidence case under article 14(6) and section 133 is not linked to any acquittal on the merits. Rather, it is to be paid when not only has there been a reversal of the conviction but also where the additional factor exists of a miscarriage of justice demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt, or conclusively, to have taken place. viii)It can no doubt be said ... that just as compensation for acquittal under the Norwegian scheme was described by the Court as a procedure whose object was ‘to establish whether the State had a financial obligation to compensate the burden it had created for the ... person by the proceedings it had instituted against him’ (see Ov.Norway ...), so too is the scheme for compensation for miscarriage of justice under article 14(6). But that is to beg the question when the scheme in question creates such an obligation. If article 6(2) were to apply to claims under the scheme here under consideration, there would be no reason in logic or fairness to distinguish between those whose convictions are quashed on grounds of fresh evidence and those whose convictions are quashed on other grounds; each would be in the position of being able to rely on the presumption of innocence. Indeed, there would be no obvious reason for distinguishing between those who are convicted but whose convictions are quashed, and those who are acquitted at trial. But it is clear that article 14(6) does not provide for compensation to be paid except in the limited circumstances to which it refers. ix)In Mullen, Lord Steyn held ... that article 6(2) ECHR did not apply to the special rules created by article 14(6) ICCPR. Lord Bingham’s decision was that ... the Austrian and Norwegian cases ... could not assist Mullen since his ‘acquittal’ was unrelated to the merits of the accusation against him. ...” 42.The applicant sought leave to appeal to the House of Lords. Leave was refused on 11 December 2008.>The Criminal Appeal Act 1968 43.Section 2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 (as amended) provides that the Court of Appeal: “(a)shall allow an appeal against conviction if they think that the conviction is unsafe; and (b)shall dismiss such an appeal in any other case.” (b)shall dismiss such an appeal in any other case.” 44.Section 2(2) requires the court to quash the conviction in the event that it allows the appeal. 44.Section 2(2) requires the court to quash the conviction in the event that it allows the appeal. 45.Section 2(3) provides: “An order of the Court of Appeal quashing a conviction shall, except when under section 7 below the appellant is ordered to be retried, operate as a direction to the court of trial to enter, instead of the record of conviction, a judgment and verdict of acquittal.” “An order of the Court of Appeal quashing a conviction shall, except when under section 7 below the appellant is ordered to be retried, operate as a direction to the court of trial to enter, instead of the record of conviction, a judgment and verdict of acquittal.” 46.Section 7(1) of the 1968 Act provides that where the Court of Appeal allows an appeal against conviction and it appears to the court that the interests of justice so require, it may order the appellant to be retried. Aretrial may be inappropriate where, for example, the defendant has already served the sentence and there would be nothing to be gained from a retrial.>Judicial approach to quashing convictions in cases of new evidence 47.In R v. Pendleton [2001] UKHL 66, the House of Lords considered what should be the approach of appeal courts in cases involving fresh evidence. Lord Bingham of Cornhill explained: “19.... [T]he House in Stafford [v. Director of Public Prosecutions [1974] AC 878] were right to reject the submission of counsel that the Court of Appeal had asked the wrong question by taking as the test the effect of the fresh evidence on their minds and not the effect that that evidence would have had on the mind of the jury ... I am not persuaded that the House laid down any incorrect principle in Stafford, so long as the Court of Appeal bears very clearly in mind that the question for its consideration is whether the conviction is safe and not whether the accused is guilty. But the test advocated by counsel in Stafford ... does have a dual virtue ... First, it reminds the Court of Appeal that it is not and should never become the primary decision-maker. Secondly, it reminds the Court of Appeal that it has an imperfect and incomplete understanding of the full processes which led the jury to convict. The Court of Appeal can make its assessment of the fresh evidence it has heard, but save in a clear case it is at a disadvantage in seeking to relate that evidence to the rest of the evidence which the jury heard. For these reasons it will usually be wise for the Court of Appeal, in a case of any difficulty, to test their own provisional view by asking whether the evidence, if given at the trial, might reasonably have affected the decision of the trial jury to convict. If it might, the conviction must be thought to be unsafe.” “19.... [T]he House in Stafford [v. Director of Public Prosecutions [1974] AC 878] were right to reject the submission of counsel that the Court of Appeal had asked the wrong question by taking as the test the effect of the fresh evidence on their minds and not the effect that that evidence would have had on the mind of the jury ...

If it might, the conviction must be thought to be unsafe.” 48.In the subsequent Privy Council case of Dial and another v. The State (Trinidad and Tobago) [2005] UKPC 4, Lord Brown of Eaton-Under-Heywood commented: “31.... [T]he law is now clearly established and can be simply stated as follows. Where fresh evidence is adduced on a criminal appeal it is for the Court of Appeal, assuming always that it accepts it, to evaluate its importance in the context of the remainder of the evidence in the case. If the court concludes that the fresh evidence raises no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused it will dismiss the appeal. The primary question is for the Court itself and is not what effect the fresh evidence would have had on the mind of the jury. That said, if the Court regards the case as a difficult one, it may find it helpful to test its view ‘by asking whether the evidence, if given at the trial, might reasonably have affected the decision of the trial jury to convict’: ([Rv.]Pendleton ...) The guiding principle nevertheless remains that stated ... in Stafford ... and affirmed by the House in Pendleton:>The Criminal Justice Act 1988 49.Section 133(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”) provides that: “(1)Subject to subsection (2) below, when a person has been convicted of a criminal offence and when subsequently his conviction has been reversed or he has been pardoned on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows beyond reasonable doubt that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the Secretary of State shall pay compensation for the miscarriage of justice to the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such conviction ... unless the non-disclosure of the unknown fact was wholly or partly attributable to the person convicted.” “(1)Subject to subsection (2) below, when a person has been convicted of a criminal offence and when subsequently his conviction has been reversed or he has been pardoned on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows beyond reasonable doubt that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the Secretary of State shall pay compensation for the miscarriage of justice to the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such conviction ... unless the non-disclosure of the unknown fact was wholly or partly attributable to the person convicted.” 50.The question whether there is a right to compensation under section133 is determined by the Secretary of State following an application by the person concerned. 50.The question whether there is a right to compensation under section133 is determined by the Secretary of State following an application by the person concerned. 51.Pursuant to section 133(5), the term “reversed” is to be construed as referring to a conviction having been quashed, inter alia, on an appeal out of time; or following a reference to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. 51.Pursuant to section 133(5), the term “reversed” is to be construed as referring to a conviction having been quashed, inter alia, on an appeal out of time; or following a reference to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. 52.Section 133(6) provides that a person suffers punishment as a result of a conviction when sentence is passed on him for the offence of which he was convicted. 52.Section 133(6) provides that a person suffers punishment as a result of a conviction when sentence is passed on him for the offence of which he was convicted. 53.Further provisions were inserted into section 133 following the enactment of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 introducing a two-year time-limit for applications and clarifying the relationship between the conviction being “reversed” and the possibility of retrial. These provisions came into force on 1 December 2008, that is, after the decision of the Court of Appeal on the compensation claim in the present case (see paragraph 33 above).>Judicial interpretation of “miscarriage of justice” (a)Prior to the compensation proceedings in the applicant’s case 54.In R(Mullen) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 18, the House of Lords considered the application of section 133 of the 1988 Act. Mr Mullen’s trial in England had been possible only because the British authorities had arranged his deportation from in flagrant breach of local and international law. This emerged only after conviction and his appeal to the Court of Appeal, approximately seven years later, resulted in the quashing of his conviction on the ground that his deportation had involved abuse of process, namely a gross abuse of executive power. His claim for compensation under section 133, or the ex gratia scheme which existed in parallel at that time, was refused by the Secretary of State. In subsequent judicial review proceedings, the House of Lords unanimously found that section 133 did not require the payment of compensation for a miscarriage of justice in his case. However, there was a divergence of views between Lord Bingham and Lord Steyn as to the proper construction of section 133. 54.In R(Mullen) v.

However, there was a divergence of views between Lord Bingham and Lord Steyn as to the proper construction of section 133. 55.As to the term “wrongful conviction”, Lord Bingham said: “4.... The expression ‘wrongful convictions’ is not a legal term of art and it has no settled meaning. Plainly the expression includes the conviction of those who are innocent of the crime of which they have been convicted. But in ordinary parlance the expression would, I think, be extended to those who, whether guilty or not, should clearly not have been convicted at their trials. It is impossible and unnecessary to identify the manifold reasons why a defendant may be convicted when he should not have been. It may be because the evidence against him was fabricated or perjured. It may be because flawed expert evidence was relied on to secure conviction. It may be because evidence helpful to the defence was concealed or withheld. It may be because the jury was the subject of malicious interference. It may be because of judicial unfairness or misdirection. In cases of this kind, it may, or more often may not, be possible to say that a defendant is innocent, but it is possible to say that he has been wrongly convicted. The common factor in such cases is that something has gone seriously wrong in the investigation of the offence or the conduct of the trial, resulting in the conviction of someone who should not have been convicted.” “4....

He continued: “8.... In quashing Mr Mullen’s conviction the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) condemned the abuse of executive power which had led to his apprehension and abduction in the only way it effectively could. But it identified no failure in the trial process. It is for failures of the trial process that the Secretary of State is bound, by section 133 and article 14(6), to pay compensation. On that limited ground I would hold that he is not bound to pay compensation under section 133.” “8....

On that limited ground I would hold that he is not bound to pay compensation under section 133.” 58.He hesitated to accept the submission of the Secretary of State to the effect that section 133, reflecting Article 14 § 6 of the ICCPR, obliged him to pay compensation only when a defendant, finally acquitted in circumstances satisfying the statutory conditions, was shown beyond reasonable doubt to be innocent of the crime of which he had been convicted. In light of his conclusion that no compensation was payable, it was, however, not necessary to decide this point. 58.He hesitated to accept the submission of the Secretary of State to the effect that section 133, reflecting Article 14 § 6 of the ICCPR, obliged him to pay compensation only when a defendant, finally acquitted in circumstances satisfying the statutory conditions, was shown beyond reasonable doubt to be innocent of the crime of which he had been convicted. In light of his conclusion that no compensation was payable, it was, however, not necessary to decide this point. 59.Lord Steyn observed that section 133 was modelled on Article 14 § 6 of the ICCPR, as was Article 3 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention. He reviewed several judgments of this Court in which a violation of Article 6 §2 had been found in respect of compensation proceedings where the applicants had been acquitted at trial, concluding: “41.... The decisions are not relevant to the issue presently under consideration. The interaction between article 6(2) and article 3 of Protocol No. 7 was not under consideration. The reason was that in Austrian legislation there was a wider right to compensation than provided by article 3 of Protocol No. 7.” “41.... The decisions are not relevant to the issue presently under consideration. The interaction between article 6(2) and article 3 of Protocol No. 7 was not under consideration. The reason was that in Austrian legislation there was a wider right to compensation than provided by article 3 of Protocol No. 7.” 60.Having concluded that the jurisprudence of this Court was of no assistance in the interpretation of section 133, Lord Steyn turned to examine the interpretation of Article 14 § 6 on its own terms. He noted that a case where a defendant was wrongly convicted and had his conviction quashed on an appeal lodged within ordinary time limits did not qualify for compensation. He further noted that if there was no new or newly discovered fact, but simply a recognition that an earlier dismissal of an appeal was wrong, the case fell outside the scope of Article 14 § 6. He therefore concluded that there was no overarching purpose of compensating all who were wrongly convicted; and that the fundamental right under Article 14 § 6 was unquestionably narrowly circumscribed. He continued: “46.The requirement that the new or newly discovered fact must show conclusively (or beyond reasonable doubt in the language of section 133) ‘that there has been a miscarriage of justice’ is important. It filters out cases where it is only established that there may have been a wrongful conviction. Similarly excluded are cases where it is only probable that there has been a wrongful conviction. These two categories would include the vast majority of cases where an appeal is allowed out of time ... I regard these considerations as militating against the expansive interpretation of ‘miscarriage of justice’ put forward on behalf of Mr Mullen. They also demonstrate the implausibility of the extensive interpretation ...: it entirely erodes the effect of evidence showing ‘conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice’. While accepting that in other contexts ‘a miscarriage of justice’ is capable of bearing a narrower or wider meanings, the only relevant context points to a narrow interpretation, viz the case where innocence is demonstrated.” “46.The requirement that the new or newly discovered fact must show conclusively (or beyond reasonable doubt in the language of section 133) ‘that there has been a miscarriage of justice’ is important.

This is the international meaning which Parliament adopted when it enacted section 133 of the 1988 Act.” “56.... the autonomous meaning of the words ‘a miscarriage of justice’ extends only to ‘clear cases of miscarriage of justice, in the sense that there would be acknowledgement that the person concerned was clearly innocent’ as it is put in the Explanatory Report [to Protocol No. 7]. This is the international meaning which Parliament adopted when it enacted section 133 of the 1988 Act.” 62.As Mr Mullen was not innocent of the charge, he was not entitled to compensation under section 133. (b)Following the compensation proceedings in the applicant’s case 63.In R(Adams) v. Secretary of State for Justice [2011] UKSC 18, the Supreme Court, sitting as a panel of nine judges, was asked to look again at the meaning of “miscarriage of justice” in section 133 of the 1988 Act. The justices expressed varying views as to the correct interpretation of the term. A.International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 64.Article 14 § 2 of the ICCPR provides that: “Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.” “Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.” 65.Article 14 § 6 provides: “When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence and when subsequently his conviction has been reversed or he has been pardoned on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the nondisclosure of the unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him.” “When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence and when subsequently his conviction has been reversed or he has been pardoned on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the nondisclosure of the unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him.” 66.The United Nations Human Rights Committee has considered the operation of the relevant ICCPR Articles. In W.J.H. v. the Netherlands, Communication No. 408/1990, UN Doc.CCPR/C/45/D/408/1990(1992), where a violation of Article14 §§ 2 and 6 was alleged following the refusal of compensation after acquittal, the Committee observed that Article 14 § 2 applied only to criminal proceedings and not to proceedings for compensation. It also found that the conditions set out in Article 14 § 6 were not satisfied. 66.The United Nations Human Rights Committee has considered the operation of the relevant ICCPR Articles. In W.J.H. v. the Netherlands, Communication No. 408/1990, UN Doc.CCPR/C/45/D/408/1990(1992), where a violation of Article14 §§ 2 and 6 was alleged following the refusal of compensation after acquittal, the Committee observed that Article 14 § 2 applied only to criminal proceedings and not to proceedings for compensation. It also found that the conditions set out in Article 14 § 6 were not satisfied. 67.In its General Comment No. 32 on Article 14, published on 23August 2007, the United Nations Human Rights Committee said, in respect of the presumption of innocence: “30.According to article 14, paragraph 2 everyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law. The presumption of innocence, which is fundamental to the protection of human rights, imposes on the prosecution the burden of proving the charge, guarantees that no guilt can be presumed until the charge has been proved beyond reasonable doubt, ensures that the accused has the benefit of doubt, and requires that persons accused of a criminal act must be treated in accordance with this principle. It is a duty for all public authorities to refrain from prejudging the outcome of a trial, e.g. by abstaining from making public statements affirming the guilt of the accused. Defendants should normally not be shackled or kept in cages during trials or otherwise presented to the court in a manner indicating that they may be dangerous criminals. The media should avoid news coverage undermining the presumption of innocence. Furthermore, the length of pre-trial detention should never be taken as an indication of guilt and its degree. The denial of bail or findings of liability in civil proceedings do not affect the presumption of innocence.” (footnotes omitted) “30.According to article 14, paragraph 2 everyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law.

Furthermore, no compensation is due if the conviction is set aside upon appeal, i.e. before the judgment becomes final, or by a pardon that is humanitarian or discretionary in nature, or motivated by considerations of equity, not implying that there has been a miscarriage of justice.” (footnotes omitted) B.Article 3 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention 69.Article 3 of Protocol No. 7 reads: “When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence and when subsequently his conviction has been reversed, or he has been pardoned, on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such conviction shall be compensated according to the law or the practice of the State concerned, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him.” “When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence and when subsequently his conviction has been reversed, or he has been pardoned, on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such conviction shall be compensated according to the law or the practice of the State concerned, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him.” 70.The United Kingdom has neither signed nor acceded to Protocol No.7. 70.The United Kingdom has neither signed nor acceded to Protocol No.7. 71.The Explanatory Report to Protocol No. 7 was prepared by the Steering Committee for Human Rights and submitted to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. It explains at the outset that the report itself “... does not constitute an instrument providing an authoritative interpretation of the text of the Protocol, although it might be of such a nature as to facilitate the understanding of the provisions contained therein”. “... does not constitute an instrument providing an authoritative interpretation of the text of the Protocol, although it might be of such a nature as to facilitate the understanding of the provisions contained therein”. 72.As regards Article 3 of Protocol No. 7, the report notes, inter alia, as follows. “23.Secondly, the article applies only where the person’s conviction has been reversed or he has been pardoned, in either case on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice – that is, some serious failure in the judicial process involving grave prejudice to the convicted person. Therefore, there is no requirement under the article to pay compensation if the conviction has been reversed or a pardon has been granted on some other ground. ... 25.In all cases in which these preconditions are satisfied, compensation is payable ‘according to the law or the practice of the State concerned’. This does not mean that no compensation is payable if the law or practice makes no provision for such compensation. It means that the law or practice of the State should provide for the payment of compensation in all cases to which the article applies. The intention is that States would be obliged to compensate persons only in clear cases of miscarriage of justice, in the sense that there would be acknowledgement that the person concerned was clearly innocent. The article is not intended to give a right of compensation where all the preconditions are not satisfied, for example, where an appellate court had quashed a conviction because it had discovered some fact which introduced a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused and which had been overlooked by the trial judge.” C.Law and practice on compensation proceedings following discontinuation or acquittal in the member States 73.According to the information before the Court, there is no uniform approach in respect of the law and practice on compensation proceedings following discontinuation or acquittal in thirty-six member States surveyed. Some States have more than one scheme in place, covering different types of compensation. 73.According to the information before the Court, there is no uniform approach in respect of the law and practice on compensation proceedings following discontinuation or acquittal in thirty-six member States surveyed.

15,001-58908,Grand Chamber,"8.Nicole Van Geyseghem, a nursery nurse born in 1942, is a Belgian citizen. At the time of lodging her application, she was living in Hoeilaart (Belgium).>The applicant and four others were prosecuted for importing drugs from Brazil on three occasions between 22 June 1986 and 21 March 1987, including 2.33 kilograms of cocaine on 20 March 1987, the date on which the applicant was arrested. 10.On 10 December 1992 the Brussels Criminal Court convicted the applicant in absentia (she had failed to appear even though she had been properly served with a summons) and sentenced her to four years’ imprisonment and a fine of 180,000 Belgian francs (BEF). The court also ordered her immediate arrest on the ground that there was reason to believe that she would attempt to evade enforcement of her sentence. 11.On 26 April 1993 Mrs Van Geyseghem applied to the same court to set aside its judgment. 12.She attended the hearing of her application. On 7 May 1993 the Brussels Criminal Court, after adversarial proceedings, sentenced her to three years’ imprisonment and a fine of BEF 60,000. The court held that there was no need to order the applicant’s immediate arrest as there was no cause to fear that she would attempt to evade enforcement of her sentence. 13.On 21 May 1993 both the applicant and the prosecution appealed. 14.Although the summons to appear had been served on her in accordance with the proper procedure, Mrs Van Geyseghem did not attend the appeal hearing and neither did a lawyer on her behalf. On 14 June 1993 the Brussels Court of Appeal, ruling in the applicant’s absence, upheld the judgment of 7 May 1993 in its entirety. It also ordered the applicant’s immediate arrest on the ground that there was reason to believe that she would attempt to evade enforcement of her sentence in view of its length and of the fact that she had failed to appear both at the appeal hearing and at the original trial. 15.On 26 August 1993 the applicant applied to set aside the Court of Appeal’s judgment. Her application was served on the prosecution by means of a bailiff’s writ, in which the hearing was set down for 13September 1993. 16.The applicant did not attend the hearing in person. Her counsel, MrVerstraeten, appeared and, relying on Article 185 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 20 below), stated that he was representing his client and would be making submissions to the effect that the prosecution had become time-barred between the delivery of the Court of Appeal’s judgment in absentia and the date on which the application to set it aside was to be heard by the Court of Appeal. The court refused MrsVan Geyseghem’s counsel leave to address it and make submissions on his client’s behalf. At counsel’s request, the following was entered in the record of the hearing of 13September 1993: “The Court refuses Mr Rafael Verstraeten, of the Brussels Bar, leave to represent the appellant and to make submissions on her behalf to the effect that the prosecution is time-barred.” 17.In a judgment of 4 October 1993 the Court of Appeal declared the application void on the following grounds: “Although the application has been filed in the proper form and within the statutory time, the appellant has failed to attend the hearing on the date set by her and has not adduced any evidence of force majeure preventing her from attending in person.” 18.The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of 4 October 1993. In her pleading she argued that the Court of Appeal’s refusal to grant her counsel leave to make submissions on her behalf had infringed her defence rights and Article 185 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that the accused may appear by counsel “where the hearing concerns only an objection [or] a matter unconnected with the merits of the case …”. In written submissions of 16 March 1994 summarising his address, the applicant’s counsel referred to the European Court’s judgment in the Poitrimol v.France case (23 November 1993, Series A no. 277-A). 19.The Court of Cassation dismissed her appeal in a judgment of 4 May 1994 in the following terms: “The appellant submits that her counsel attended the hearing and that the Court of Appeal, in refusing him leave to represent her and make submissions on her behalf to the effect that the prosecution was time-barred – that is, to raise ‘an objection unconnected with the merits of the case’ – infringed Articles 185, 188 and 211 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the general principle of law which requires that the rights of the defence be respected; Where a trial or appeal court is dealing with charges which may attract a custodial sentence as the principal sentence, paragraph 2 of the above-mentioned Article 185 allows an accused to appear by counsel only ‘where the hearing concerns an objection, a matter unconnected with the merits of the case or the civil interests’; Within the meaning of that provision, a claim that an action is time-barred is neither an objection nor a matter unconnected with the merits; The ground of appeal has no basis in law.” 20.The relevant Articles of the Code of Criminal Procedure read as follows: Article 185 “1.The party claiming civil damages and the party liable to pay such damages shall attend the hearing or appear by counsel.>The accused shall attend the hearing. However, the accused may appear by counsel in the case of minor offences which do not attract a custodial sentence or where the hearing concerns an objection, a matter unconnected with the merits of the case or the civil interests. The Criminal Court may still grant leave for the accused to appear by counsel where he provides evidence that he is unable to attend.>In any event, the Criminal Court may order the accused to attend. No appeal shall lie against such a decision. The judgment in which the accused is ordered to attend shall be served on the party concerned on an application by the prosecution, together with a summons to attend on the date determined by the Criminal Court. Where the accused fails to attend, the court shall determine the matter in his absence.” Article 186 “If the accused fails to attend the hearing, he shall be tried in his absence.” Article 187 “An accused who is convicted in his absence may lodge an application to set aside the judgment within fifteen days of the date on which it was served on him.” Article 188 “An application to set aside shall automatically be effective as a summons to attend the first hearing following the expiry of fifteen days, or three days where the party lodging the application is in custody. The application shall be void if the party who lodged it fails to attend the hearing. Save as hereinafter provided, no appeal by the party who lodged the application to set aside shall lie against the Criminal Court’s ruling. Where appropriate, the court may make an interim award. Such an award shall be enforceable notwithstanding an appeal.” Article 208 “A judgment on appeal delivered in absentia may be challenged by means of an application to set aside made under the same procedure and within the same time-limits as a judgment delivered in absentia by the Criminal Court. The application shall automatically be effective as a summons to attend the first hearing following the expiry of fifteen days, or three days where the party lodging the application is in custody. The application to set aside shall be void if the party who lodged it fails to attend the hearing. No appeal by the party who lodged the application shall lie against the Court of Appeal’s ruling other than an appeal on points of law to the Court of Cassation.” Article 211 “The provisions of the preceding Articles which relate to the formalities of judicial investigations, the nature of evidence, the form, authenticity and signature of final judgments delivered at first instance, orders to pay costs and the penalties applicable under those Articles shall also apply to judgments delivered on appeal.” 21.Where an application to set aside has been declared void on the ground that the applicant failed to attend the hearing, the judgment which records the fact will itself be a judgment given in absentia. If the applicant again fails to attend the hearing, a second application by him to set aside will be inadmissible, in accordance with the maxim “opposition sur opposition ne vaut” (an application to set aside a judgment delivered in absentia on an application to set aside an earlier judgment delivered in absentia is ineffective). Were the convicted person able to lodge a further application to set aside the decision of the court which refused in absentia his application to set aside an initial decision also delivered in absentia, he could, by failing to attend and lodging one application after another, indefinitely hinder the enforcement of any conviction and thus paralyse the administration of justice.",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

121,001-59454,Grand Chamber,"13.The complaints raised in this application arise out of the Turkish military operations in northern Cyprus in July and August 1974 and the continuing division of the . At the time of the Court's consideration of the merits of the Loizidou v. case in 1996, the Turkish military presence at the material time was described in the following terms (Loizidou v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996 (merits), Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, p. 2223, §§ 16-17): “16.Turkish armed forces of more than 30,000 personnel are stationed throughout the whole of the occupied area of northern , which is constantly patrolled and has checkpoints on all main lines of communication. The army's headquarters are in Kyrenia. The 28th Infantry Division is based in Asha (Assia) with its sector covering Famagusta to the Mia Milia suburb of and with about 14,500 personnel. The 39th Infantry Division, with about 15,500 personnel, is based at Myrtou village, and its sector ranges from Yerolakkos village to Lefka. TOURDYK (Turkish Forces in Cyprus under the Treaty of Guarantee) is stationed at Orta Keuy village near Nicosia, with a sector running from Nicosia International Airport to the . A Turkish naval command and outpost are based at and Kyrenia respectively. Turkish airforce personnel are based at Lefkoniko, Krini and other airfields. The Turkish airforce is stationed on the Turkish mainland at . 17.The Turkish forces and all civilians entering military areas are subject to Turkish military courts, as stipulated so far as concerns 'TRNC citizens' by the Prohibited Military Areas Decree of 1979 (section 9) and Article 156 of the Constitution of the 'TRNC'.” 14.A major development in the continuing division of Cyprus occurred in November 1983 with the proclamation of the “Turkish Republic of Northern ” (the “TRNC”) and the subsequent enactment of the “TRNC Constitution” on 7 May 1985. This development was condemned by the international community. On 18 November 1983 the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution541 (1983) declaring the proclamation of the establishment of the “TRNC” legally invalid and calling upon all States not to recognise any Cypriot State other than the Republic of Cyprus. A similar call was made by the Security Council on 11 May 1984 in its Resolution 550 (1984). In November 1983 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe decided that it continued to regard the government of the Republic of Cyprus as the sole legitimate government of Cyprus and called for respect of the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of the . 15.According to the respondent Government, the “TRNC” is a democratic and constitutional State which is politically independent of all other sovereign States including Turkey, and the administration in northern Cyprus has been set up by the Turkish-Cypriot people in the exercise of its right to self-determination and not by . Notwithstanding this view, it is only the Cypriot government which is recognised internationally as the government of the in the context of diplomatic and treaty relations and the working of international organisations. 16.United Nations peacekeeping forces (“UNFICYP”) maintain a buffer-zone. A number of political initiatives have been taken at the level of the United Nations aimed at settling the problem on the basis of institutional arrangements acceptable to both sides. To this end, inter-communal talks have been sponsored by the Secretary-General of the United Nations acting under the direction of the Security Council. In this connection, the respondent Government maintain that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities in northern have pursued the talks on the basis of what they consider to be already agreed principles of bi-zonality and bi-communality within the framework of a federal constitution. Support for this basis of negotiation is found in the UN Secretary-General's Set of Ideas of 15 July 1992 and the UN Security Council resolutions of 26 August 1992 and 25 November 1992 confirming that a federal solution sought by both sides will be “bi-communal” and “bi-zonal”. Furthermore, and of relevance to the instant application, in 1981 the United Nations Committee on Missing Persons (“CMP”) was set up to “look into cases of persons reported missing in the inter-communal fighting as well as in the events of July 1974 and afterwards” and “to draw up comprehensive lists of missing persons of both communities, specifying as appropriate whether they are still alive or dead, and in the latter case approximate times of death”. The CMP has not yet completed its investigations. 17.The events of July and August 1974 and their aftermath gave rise to three previous applications by the applicant Government against the respondent State under former Article 24 of the Convention. The first (no.6780/74) and second (no. 6950/75) applications were joined by the Commission and led to the adoption on 10 July 1976 of a report under former Article 31 of the Convention (“the 1976 report”) in which the Commission expressed the opinion that the respondent State had violated Articles 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. On 20 January 1979 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in turn adopted, with reference to an earlier decision of 21 October 1977, Resolution DH (79) 1 in which it expressed, inter alia, the conviction that “the enduring protection of human rights in Cyprus can only be brought about through the re-establishment of peace and confidence between the two communities; and that inter-communal talks constitute the appropriate framework for reaching a solution of the dispute”. In its resolution the Committee of Ministers strongly urged the parties to resume the talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in order to agree upon solutions on all aspects of the dispute (see paragraph 16 above). The Committee of Ministers viewed this decision as completing its consideration of the case. The third application (no. 8007/77) lodged by the applicant Government was the subject of a further report under former Article 31 adopted by the Commission on 4 October 1983 (“the 1983 report”). In that report the Commission expressed the opinion that the respondent State was in breach of its obligations under Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. On 2 April 1992 the Committee of Ministers adopted Resolution DH (92) 12 in respect of the Commission's 1983 report. In its resolution the Committee of Ministers limited itself to a decision to make the 1983 report public and stated that its consideration of the case was thereby completed. 18.The instant application is the first to have been referred to the Court. The applicant Government requested the Court in their memorial to “decide and declare that the respondent State is responsible for continuing violations and other violations of Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17 and 18 of the Convention and of Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No. 1”. These allegations were invoked with reference to four broad categories of complaints: alleged violations of the rights of Greek-Cypriot missing persons and their relatives; alleged violations of the home and property rights of displaced persons; alleged violations of the rights of enclaved Greek Cypriots in northern Cyprus; alleged violations of the rights of Turkish Cypriots and the Gypsy community in northern Cyprus. 19.The Court considers it appropriate at this stage to summarise the Commission's findings of fact in respect of the various violations of the Convention alleged by the applicant Government as well as the essential arguments advanced by both parties and the documentary and other evidence relied on by the Commission. 20.The applicant Government essentially claimed in their application that about 1,491 Greek Cypriots were still missing twenty years after the cessation of hostilities. These persons were last seen alive in Turkish custody and their fate has never been accounted for by the respondent State. 21.The respondent Government maintained in reply that there was no proof that any of the missing persons were still alive or were being kept in custody. In their principal submission, the issues raised by the applicant Government should continue to be pursued within the framework of the United Nations Committee on Missing Persons (see paragraph 16 above) rather than under the Convention. 22.The Commission proceeded on the understanding that its task was not to establish what actually happened to the Greek-Cypriot persons who went missing following the Turkish military operations conducted in northern in July and August 1974. Rather, it saw its task as one of determining whether or not the alleged failure of the respondent State to clarify the facts surrounding the disappearances constituted a continuing violation of the Convention. 23.To that end, the Commission had particular regard to its earlier findings in its 1976 and 1983 reports. It recalled that in its 1976 report it had stated that it was widely accepted that a considerable number of Cypriots were still missing as a result of armed conflict in Cyprus and that a number of persons declared to be missing were identified as Greek Cypriots taken prisoner by the Turkish army. This finding, in the Commission's opinion at the time, created a presumption of Turkish responsibility for the fate of persons shown to be in Turkish custody. While noting that killings of Greek-Cypriot civilians had occurred on a large scale, the Commission also considered at the time of its 1976 report that it was unable to ascertain whether, and under what circumstances, Greek-Cypriot prisoners declared to be missing had been deprived of their life. 24.In the present case, the Commission further recalled that in its 1983 report it found it established that there were sufficient indications in an indefinite number of cases that missing Greek Cypriots had been in Turkish custody in 1974 and that this finding once again created a presumption of Turkish responsibility for the fate of these persons. 25.The Commission found that the evidence submitted to it in the instant case confirmed its earlier findings that certain of the missing persons were last seen in Turkish or Turkish-Cypriot custody. In this connection, the Commission had regard to the following: a statement of Mr Denktaş, “President of the TRNC”, broadcast on 1 March 1996, in which he admitted that forty-two Greek-Cypriot prisoners were handed over to Turkish-Cypriot fighters who killed them and that in order to prevent further such killings prisoners were subsequently transferred to Turkey; the broadcast statement of Professor Yalçin Küçük, a former Turkish officer who had served in the Turkish army at the time and participated in the 1974 military operation in Cyprus, in which he suggested that the Turkish army had engaged in widespread killings of, inter alia, civilians in so-called cleaning-up operations; the Dillon Report submitted to the United States Congress in May 1998 indicating, inter alia, that Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot soldiers rounded up Greek-Cypriot civilians in the village of Asha on 18 August 1974 and took away males over the age of 15, most of whom were reportedly killed by Turkish-Cypriot fighters; the written statements of witnesses tending to corroborate the Commission's earlier findings that many persons now missing were taken into custody by Turkish soldiers or Turkish-Cypriot paramilitaries. 26.The Commission concluded that, notwithstanding evidence of the killing of Greek-Cypriot prisoners and civilians, there was no proof that any of the missing persons were killed in circumstances for which the respondent State could be held responsible; nor did the Commission find any evidence to the effect that any of the persons taken into custody were still being detained or kept in servitude by the respondent State. On the other hand, the Commission found it established that the facts surrounding the fate of the missing persons had not been clarified by the authorities and brought to the notice of the victims' relatives. 27.The Commission further concluded that its examination of the applicant Government's complaints in the instant application was not precluded by the ongoing work of the CMP. It noted in this connection that the scope of the investigation being conducted by the CMP was limited to determining whether or not any of the missing persons on its list were dead or alive; nor was the CMP empowered to make findings either on the cause of death or on the issue of responsibility for any deaths so established. Furthermore, the territorial jurisdiction of the CMP was limited to the island of Cyprus, thus excluding investigations in where some of the disappearances were claimed to have occurred. The Commission also observed that persons who might be responsible for violations of the Convention were promised impunity and that it was doubtful whether the CMP's investigation could extend to actions by the Turkish army or Turkish officials on Cypriot territory. 28.The Commission established the facts under this heading against the background of the applicant Government's principal submission that over 211,000 displaced Greek Cypriots and their children continued to be prevented as a matter of policy from returning to their homes in northern and from having access to their property there for any purpose. The applicant Government submitted that the presence of the Turkish army together with “TRNC”-imposed border restrictions ensured that the return of displaced persons was rendered physically impossible and, as a corollary, that their cross-border family visits were gravely impeded. What started as a gradual and continuing process of illegality over the years had now resulted in the transfer of the property left behind by the displaced persons to the “TRNC” authorities without payment of compensation and its re-assignment, together with “title deeds”, to State bodies, Turkish Cypriots and settlers from . 29.The respondent Government maintained before the Commission that the question of the Varosha district of Famagusta along with the issues of freedom of movement, freedom of settlement and the right of property could only be resolved within the framework of the inter-communal talks (see paragraph 16 above) and on the basis of the principles agreed on by both sides for the conduct of the talks. Until an overall solution to the question, acceptable to both sides, was found, and having regard to security considerations, there could be no question of a right of the displaced persons to return. The respondent Government further submitted that the regulation of property abandoned by displaced persons, as with restrictions on cross-border movement, fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the “TRNC” authorities. 30.The Commission found that it was common knowledge that with the exception of a few hundred Maronites living in the Kormakiti area and Greek Cypriots living in the Karpas peninsula, the whole Greek-Cypriot population which before 1974 resided in the northern part of Cyprus had left that area, the large majority of these people now living in southern . The reality of this situation was not contested by the respondent Government. 31.The Commission noted with reference to its earlier findings in its 1976 and 1983 reports that there was no essential change in the situation obtaining at the time of the introduction of the instant application. Accordingly, and this was not disputed either by the respondent Government, displaced Greek Cypriots had no possibility of returning to their homes in northern Cyprus and were physically prevented from crossing into the northern part on account of the fact that it was sealed off by the Turkish army. The arrangements introduced by the “TRNC” authorities in 1998 to allow Greek Cypriots and Maronites to cross into northern for the purposes of family visits or, as regards Greek Cypriots, visits to the Apostolos Andreas Monastery, did not affect this conclusion. 32.Nor did the respondent Government dispute the fact that Greek-Cypriot owners of property in northern continued to be prevented from having access to, controlling, using and enjoying their property. As to the fate of that property, the Commission found it established that up until 1989 there was an administrative practice of the Turkish-Cypriot authorities to leave the official Land Register unaffected and to register separately the “abandoned” property and its allocation. The beneficiaries of allocations were issued with “possessory certificates” but not “deeds of title” to the properties concerned. However, as from June 1989 the practice changed and thereafter “title deeds” were issued and the relevant entries concerning the change of ownership were made in the Land Register. The Commission found it established that, at least since June 1989, the Turkish-Cypriot authorities no longer recognised any ownership rights of Greek Cypriots in respect of their properties in northern . The Commission found confirmation for this finding in the provisions of “Article 159 § 1 (b) of the TRNC Constitution” of 7 May 1985 and “Law no. 52/1995” purporting to give effect to that provision. 33.Although the respondent Government pointed out in their submissions to the Commission that the issue of the right of displaced Greek Cypriots to return to their homes was a matter to be determined within the framework of the inter-communal talks sponsored by the Secretary-General of the United Nations (see paragraph 16 above), the Commission found that there had been no significant progress in recent years in the discussion of issues such as freedom of settlement, payment of compensation to Greek Cypriots for the interference with their property rights, or restitution of Greek-Cypriot property in the Varosha district. 34.The applicant Government adduced evidence in support of their complaint that the dwindling number of Greek Cypriots living in the Karpas peninsula of northern Cyprus were subjected to continuing oppressive treatment which amounted to a complete denial of their rights and a negation of their human dignity. In addition to the harassment and intimidation which they suffered at the hands of Turkish settlers, and which has gone unpunished, the enclaved Greek Cypriots laboured under restrictions which violated many of the substantive rights contained in the Convention. The continuous daily interferences with their rights could not be redressed at the local level on account of the absence of effective remedies before the “TRNC” courts. Similar but less extensive restrictions applied to the Maronite population living in the Kormakiti area of northern . 35.The respondent Government maintained before the Commission that effective judicial remedies were available to all Greek Cypriots living in northern . However, they claimed that the applicant Government actively discouraged them from taking proceedings in the “TRNC”. The respondent Government further submitted that the evidence before the Commission did not provide any basis of fact for the allegations made. 36.The Commission established the facts under this heading with reference to materials submitted by both Governments. These materials included, inter alia, written statements of persons affected by the restrictions alleged by the applicant Government; press reports dealing with the situation in northern Cyprus; case-law of the “TRNC” courts on the availability of remedies in the “TRNC”; “TRNC legislation” and decisions of the “TRNC Council of Ministers” on entry and exit arrangements at the check-point. The Commission also had regard to United Nations documents concerning the living conditions of enclaved Greek Cypriots and especially to the UN Secretary-General's progress reports of 10 December 1995 and 9 March 1998 on the humanitarian review carried out by UNFICYP in 1994-95 concerning the living conditions of Karpas Greek Cypriots, the so-called “Karpas Brief”. 37.Furthermore, the Commission's delegates heard the evidence of fourteen witnesses on the situation of Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in northern . These witnesses comprised two persons who were closely associated with the preparation of the “Karpas Brief” as well as persons proposed by both Governments. The delegates also visited, on 23 and 24 February 1998, a number of localities in northern , including Greek-Cypriot villages in the Karpas area, and heard statements from officials and other persons encountered during the visits. 38.The Commission considered the above-mentioned “Karpas Brief” an accurate description of the situation of the enclaved Greek-Cypriot and Maronite populations at about the time of the introduction of the instant application and that the proposals for remedial action recommended by UNFICYP following the humanitarian review reflected the real needs of these groups in the face of administrative practices which actually existed at the material time. Although the Commission noted that there had been a considerable improvement in the overall situation of the enclaved populations, as evidenced by the UN Secretary-General's progress reports on the “Karpas Brief” recommendations, there still remained a number of severe restrictions. These restrictions were not laid down in any “TRNC legislation” and were in the nature of administrative practices. 39.The Commission further found that there existed a functioning court system in the “TRNC” which was in principle accessible to Greek Cypriots living in northern . It appeared that at least in cases of trespass to property or personal injury there had been some successful actions brought by Greek-Cypriot litigants before the civil and criminal courts. However, in view of the scarcity of cases brought by Greek Cypriots, the Commission was led to conclude that the effectiveness of the judicial system for resident Greek Cypriots had not really been tested. 40.In a further conclusion, the Commission found that there was no evidence of continuing wrongful allocation of properties of resident Greek Cypriots to other persons during the period under consideration. However, the Commission did find it established that there was a continuing practice of the “TRNC” authorities to allocate to Turkish-Cypriots or immigrants the property of Greek Cypriots who had died or left northern . 41.In the absence of legal proceedings before the “TRNC” courts, the Commission noted that it had not been tested whether or not Greek Cypriots or Maronites living in northern were in fact considered as citizens enjoying the protection of the “TRNC Constitution”. It did however find it established that, in so far as the groups at issue complained of administrative practices such as restrictions on their freedom of movement or on family visits which were based on decisions of the “TRNC Council of Ministers”, any legal challenge to these restrictions would be futile given that such decisions were not open to review by the courts. 42.Although the Commission found no evidence of cases of actual detention of members of the enclaved population, it was satisfied that there was clear evidence that restrictions on movement and family visits continued to be applied to Greek Cypriots and Maronites notwithstanding recent improvements. It further observed that an exit visa was still necessary for transfers to medical facilities in the south, although no fees were levied in urgent cases. There was no evidence to confirm the allegation that the processing of applications for movement was delayed in certain cases with the result that the health or life of patients was endangered; nor was there any indication of a deliberate practice of delaying the processing of such applications. 43.The Commission found it established that there were restrictions on the freedom of movement of Greek-Cypriot and Maronite schoolchildren attending schools in the south. Until the entry into force of the decision of the “TRNC Council of Ministers” of 11 February 1998, they were not allowed to return permanently to the north after having attained the age of 16 in the case of males and 18 in the case of females. The age-limit of 16years was still maintained for Greek-Cypriot male students. Up to the age-limit, certain restrictions applied to the visits of students to their parents in the north, which were gradually relaxed. However, even today such visits are subject to a visa requirement and a reduced “entry fee”. 44.As to educational facilities, the Commission held that, although there was a system of primary-school education for the children of Greek Cypriots living in northern , there were no secondary schools for them. The vast majority of schoolchildren went to the south for their secondary education and the restriction on the return of Greek-Cypriot and Maronite schoolchildren to the north after the completion of their studies had led to the separation of many families. Furthermore, school textbooks for use in the Greek-Cypriot primary school were subjected to a “vetting” procedure in the context of confidence-building measures suggested by UNFICYP. The procedure was cumbersome and a relatively high number of school-books were being objected to by the Turkish-Cypriot administration. 45.Aside from school-books, the Commission found no evidence of any restrictions being applied during the period under consideration to the importation, circulation or possession of other types of books; nor was there evidence of restrictions on the circulation of newspapers published in southern . However, there was no regular distribution system for the Greek-Cypriot press in the Karpas area and no direct post and telecommunications links between the north and south of the island. It was further noted that the enclaved population was able to receive Greek-Cypriot radio and television. 46.The Commission did not find any conclusive evidence that letters destined for Greek Cypriots were opened by the “TRNC” police or that their telephones were tapped. 47.As to alleged restrictions on religious worship, the Commission found that the main problem for Greek Cypriots in this connection stemmed from the fact that there was only one priest for the whole Karpas area and that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities were not favourable to the appointment of additional priests from the south. The Commission delegates were unable to confirm during their visit to the Karpas area whether access to the Apostolos Andreas Monastery was free at any time for Karpas Greek Cypriots. It appeared to be the case that on high religious holidays (which occur three times a year) visits to the monastery are also allowed to Greek Cypriots from the south. 48.Concerning alleged restrictions on the freedom of association of the enclaved population, the Commission observed that the relevant “TRNC” law on associations only covered the creation of associations by Turkish Cypriots. 49.The applicant Government contended before the Commission that Turkish Cypriots living in northern , especially political dissidents and the Gypsy community, were the victims of an administrative practice of violation of their Convention rights. They adduced evidence in support of their claim that these groups were victims of arbitrary arrest and detention, police misconduct, discrimination and ill-treatment and interferences in various forms with other Convention rights such as, inter alia, fair trial, private and family life, expression, association, property and education. 50.The respondent Government essentially maintained that the above allegations were unsubstantiated on the evidence and pointed to the availability of effective remedies in the “TRNC” to aggrieved persons. 51.The Commission's investigation into the applicant Government's allegations was based mainly on the oral evidence of thirteen witnesses who testified before the Commission's delegates on the situation of Turkish Cypriots and the Gypsy community living in northern . The witnesses were proposed by both parties. Their evidence was taken by the delegates in Strasbourg, Cyprus and between November 1997 and April 1998. 52.The Commission found that there existed rivalry and social conflict between the original Turkish Cypriots and immigrants from who continued to arrive in considerable numbers. Some of the original Turkish Cypriots and their political groups and media resented the “TRNC” policy of full integration for the settlers. 53.Furthermore, while there was a significant incidence of emigration from the “TRNC” for economic reasons, it could not be excluded that there were also cases of Turkish Cypriots having fled the “TRNC” out of fear of political persecution. The Commission considered that there was no reason to doubt the correctness of witnesses' assertions that in a few cases complaints of harassment or discrimination by private groups of or against political opponents were not followed up by the “TRNC” police. However, it concluded that it was not established beyond reasonable doubt that there was in fact a consistent administrative practice of the “TRNC” authorities, including the courts, of refusing protection to political opponents of the ruling parties. In so far as it was alleged by the applicant Government that the authorities themselves were involved in the harassment of political opponents, the Commission did not have sufficient details concerning the incidents complained of (for example, the dispersing of demonstrations, short-term arrests) which would allow it to form an opinion as to the justification or otherwise of the impugned acts. The Commission noted that, in any event, it did not appear that the remedy of habeas corpus had been invoked by persons claiming to be victims of arbitrary arrest or detention. 54.Regarding the alleged discrimination against and arbitrary treatment of members of the Turkish-Cypriot Gypsy community, the Commission found that judicial remedies had apparently not been used in respect of particularly grave incidents such as the pulling down of shacks near Morphou and the refusal of airline companies to transport Gypsies to the United Kingdom without a visa. 55.In a further conclusion, the Commission observed that there was no evidence before it of Turkish-Cypriot civilians having been subjected to the jurisdiction of military courts during the period under consideration. Furthermore, and with respect to the evidence before it, the Commission considered that it had not been established that, during the period under consideration, there was an official prohibition on the circulation of Greek-language newspapers in northern or that the creation of bi-communal associations was prevented. In respect of the alleged refusal of the “TRNC” authorities to allow Turkish Cypriots to return to their properties in southern , the Commission observed that no concrete instances were referred to it of any persons who had wished to do so during the period under consideration.",2001,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT REJECTS THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT'S CRITICISM IN THIS RESPECT.
112.  THE COURT ALSO OBSERVES THAT IN ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE IN RELATION TO THE VARIOUS COMPLAINTS DECLARED ADMISSIBLE, THE COMMISSION APPLIED THE STANDARD OF PROOF “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” AS ENUNCIATED BY THE COURT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT OF 18 JANUARY 1978 (SERIES A NO. 25), IT BEING NOTED THAT SUCH PROOF MAY FOLLOW FROM THE COEXISTENCE OF SUFFICIENTLY STRONG, CLEAR AND CONCORDANT INFERENCES OR OF SIMILAR UNREBUTTED PRESUMPTIONS OF FACT (IBID., PP. 64-65, § 161).
113.  THE COURT, FOR ITS PART, ENDORSES THE APPLICATION OF THIS STANDARD, ALL THE MORE SO SINCE IT WAS FIRST ARTICULATED IN THE CONTEXT OF A PREVIOUS INTERSTATE CASE AND HAS, SINCE THE DATE OF THE ADOPTION OF THE JUDGMENT IN THAT CASE, BECOME PART OF THE COURT'S ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW (FOR A RECENT EXAMPLE, SEE SALMAN V. TURKEY [GC], NO. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000-VII).
MOREOVER, AS REGARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE EXISTENCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES, THE COURT DOES NOT RELY ON THE CONCEPT THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS BORNE BY ONE OR THE OTHER OF THE TWO GOVERNMENTS CONCERNED. RATHER, IT MUST EXAMINE ALL THE MATERIAL BEFORE IT, IRRESPECTIVE OF ITS ORIGIN (SEE THE ABOVE-MENTIONED IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, P. 64 § 160).
114.  THE COURT NOTES, HOWEVER, THAT THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT HAVE DISPUTED THE APPROPRIATENESS OF APPLYING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED STANDARD OF PROOF WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ALLEGATIONS THAT THE VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION OF WHICH THEY COMPLAIN RESULT FROM ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES ON THE PART OF THE RESPONDENT STATE. IN THEIR SUBMISSION, THE COMMISSION ERRED IN NOT HAVING REGARD TO THE EXISTENCE OF “SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE” OF ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES AND ITS RELIANCE ON THE “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” STANDARD PREVENTED IT FROM REACHING THE CORRECT CONCLUSION ON THE FACTS AS REGARDS A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS. FOR THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT, THE STANDARD OF PROOF APPLIED BY THE COMMISSION IS AT VARIANCE WITH THE APPROACH FOLLOWED BY THE COURT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, AN APPROACH WHICH, THEY MAINTAIN, HAD ALREADY BEEN ANTICIPATED IN THE COMMISSION'S DECISION IN THE “GREEK CASE” (YEARBOOK 12).
115.  THE COURT RECALLS HOWEVER THAT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, IT REJECTED THE IRISH GOVERNMENT'S SUBMISSION THAT THE “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” STANDARD OF PROOF WAS AN EXCESSIVELY RIGID STANDARD FOR ESTABLISHING THE EXISTENCE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE OF VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION (LOC. CIT., PP. 64-65, § 161). THE “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” STANDARD WAS APPLIED IN THAT CASE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EVIDENCE BORE OUT THE ALLEGATION OF A PRACTICE OF VIOLATION. THE COURT WILL ACCORDINGLY ASSESS THE FACTS AS FOUND BY THE COMMISSION WITH REFERENCE TO THIS STANDARD. FURTHERMORE, THE COURT WILL APPLY THE DEFINITION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CONVENTION SET OUT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, NAMELY AN ACCUMULATION OF IDENTICAL OR ANALOGOUS BREACHES WHICH ARE SUFFICIENTLY NUMEROUS AND INTER-CONNECTED TO AMOUNT NOT MERELY TO ISOLATED INCIDENTS OR EXCEPTIONS BUT TO A PATTERN OR SYSTEM (IBID., P. 64, § 159).
116.  THE COURT FURTHER RECALLS THAT, IN THE AREA OF THE EXHAUSTION OF DOMESTIC REMEDIES, THERE IS A DISTRIBUTION OF THE BURDEN OF PROOF. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INSTANT CASE, IT IS INCUMBENT ON THE RESPONDENT GOVERNMENT CLAIMING NON-EXHAUSTION TO SATISFY THE COURT THAT THE REMEDY WAS AN EFFECTIVE ONE AVAILABLE IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE AT THE RELEVANT TIME, THAT IS TO SAY, THAT IT WAS ACCESSIBLE, WAS ONE WHICH WAS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING REDRESS IN RESPECT OF THE AGGRIEVED INDIVIDUALS' COMPLAINTS AND OFFERED REASONABLE PROSPECTS OF SUCCESS. HOWEVER, ONCE THIS BURDEN OF PROOF HAS BEEN SATISFIED IT FALLS TO THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH THAT THE REMEDY ADVANCED BY THE RESPONDENT GOVERNMENT WAS IN FACT EXHAUSTED OR WAS FOR SOME REASON INADEQUATE AND INEFFECTIVE IN THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE, OR THAT THERE EXISTED SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ABSOLVING THE PERSONS CONCERNED FROM THE REQUIREMENT OF EXHAUSTING THAT REMEDY. ONE SUCH REASON MAY BE CONSTITUTED BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES REMAINING TOTALLY PASSIVE IN THE FACE OF SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT OR INFLICTION OF HARM BY STATE AGENTS, FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THEY HAVE FAILED TO UNDERTAKE INVESTIGATIONS OR OFFER ASSISTANCE. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IT CAN BE SAID THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF SHIFTS ONCE AGAIN, SO THAT IT BECOMES INCUMBENT ON THE RESPONDENT GOVERNMENT TO SHOW WHAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE "
76,001-101568,Grand Chamber,"10.The applicant was born in 1979. He is currently serving his sentence in the Novosibirsk Region. 11.On 30 April 2001 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having murdered his father and uncle. The applicant made a written request to be provided with a legal-aid lawyer. On the same day an expert examination of fingerprints and a forensic examination were ordered and on 3 May 2001 the applicant was remanded in custody. 12.On 4 May 2001 legal-aid counsel, Ms P., was appointed to assist the applicant, and he was charged with aggravated murder on 10 May 2001. 13.From May to September 2001 a number of expert examinations were carried out. Subsequently the applicant received copies of orders for such examinations. He signed each of them confirming their receipt and indicating that he had no comments or requests. 14.On 30 September 2001 the detention order was lifted and replaced with an undertaking not to leave his place of residence. 15.In October 2001 the applicant's former cellmate in the detention facility, Mr Zh., testified that the applicant had told him in detail how he had murdered his father and another man. 16.On an unknown date the applicant's friend, Mr R., gave a witness statement alleging that the applicant had asked him to murder his father and that when R. refused the applicant seemingly intended to do it himself. 17.On 5 November 2001 the applicant was again remanded in custody. 18.On 20 December 2001 the examined the criminal charges against the applicant. The applicant pleaded not guilty. The court examined seventeen witnesses including Zh. and R., and found the applicant guilty of the murder of two persons, sentencing him to eighteen years' imprisonment. In its judgment the court referred to witness statements, forensic reports and extensive material evidence. 19.The applicant and his lawyer appealed, alleging that Zh. and R. had given their statements under pressure from the police and claiming that the investigation had been vitiated by numerous violations of the applicant's defence rights. They also complained that they had received the expert examination orders belatedly. 20.On 12 May and 29 July 2002 the applicant requested to be assigned another lawyer to represent him in the appeal proceedings because Ms P. was unable to attend the hearing, as she was already engaged in another trial. 21.On an unknown date the applicant was informed that his participation in the appeal hearing would be ensured by video link. On 26and 30 July 2002 he requested leave to attend the appeal proceedings in person because he did not consider that the video link would provide him with an adequate opportunity to participate in the hearing. 22.On 16 October 2002 the Supreme Court of the ordered the Moscow IZ-77/3 detention centre to ensure the applicant's participation in the appeal hearing, which was to take place on 31 October 2002, by video link. 23.On 31 October 2002 the Supreme Court of the examined the applicant's appeal. The applicant participated in the proceedings by video link. No defence counsel attended the hearing. The court dismissed the applicant's appeal, having found no proof that the testimony of Zh. and R. was false. As regards the alleged breach of his defence rights, the court found this to be unsubstantiated. 23.On 31 October 2002 the Supreme Court of the examined the applicant's appeal. The applicant participated in the proceedings by video link. No defence counsel attended the hearing. The court dismissed the applicant's appeal, having found no proof that the testimony of Zh. and R. was false. As regards the alleged breach of his defence rights, the court found this to be unsubstantiated. 24.In the following months the applicant filed several supervisory review complaints. In letters of 24 April and 19 November 2003 the Novosibirsk Prosecutor's Office and the General Prosecutor's Office informed the applicant that they refused to entertain his complaints. The Novosibirsk Prosecutor's Office noted, in particular, that the applicant's right to take part in the appeal proceedings had been fully respected. On 2July 2003 Judge R. of the Supreme Court refused to open supervisory review proceedings on the applicant's complaint. That decision was confirmed by the President of the Supreme Court on 5 December 2003. On 4 February 2004 another supervisory-review complaint by the applicant was returned without examination, with reference to the earlier decisions on that matter. 25.On 26 March 2007 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Russian Government. On 4 July 2007 the Presidium of the Supreme Court granted an application for supervisory review by the Deputy Prosecutor General and quashed the Supreme Court's appeal decision of 31October 2002. The Presidium found that the applicant's right to legal assistance had been violated in the appeal hearing and remitted the case for a fresh examination before the appellate court. 26.The applicant requested to take part in the appeal hearing in person. On 10 August 2007 the Supreme Court, sitting as a bench of three judges, granted him leave to attend in person and ordered the applicant's temporary transfer from the prison in the Novosibirsk Region to a detention facility in Novosibirsk (over 3,000 km from Moscow), apparently to allow him to use the video link. 27.On 20 August 2007 the applicant made a new statement of appeal. He requested the Supreme Court to examine his appeal on the basis of this new statement alone and also requested leave to attend the appeal hearing in person rather than by video link. 28.On 29 November 2007 the Supreme Court, sitting in , examined the case. First, it considered the applicant's requests of 20 August 2007. In a separate decision on procedure it found that there were no grounds to accept the applicant's new statement of appeal and decided to examine the case on the basis of the statement by the applicant's former counsel, Ms P., from 2002. It also rejected the applicant's request to attend in person, finding that the video link would be sufficient to ensure that the applicant could follow the proceedings and make objections or other submissions, and that this form of participation would be no less effective than if he was personally present in the courtroom. The Supreme Court then introduced the applicant to Ms A., his new legal-aid counsel who was present in the Supreme Court's courtroom and then allowed them fifteen minutes of confidential communication by video link before the start of the hearing. All persons, both in the courtroom and in the detention facility, left the rooms. 29.The applicant rejected the assistance of Ms A. on the grounds that he needed to meet his counsel in person. The Supreme Court, having noted that the applicant did not rely on any divergence with Ms A. in his defence, did not request her replacement by another legal-aid lawyer, did not accept the Supreme Court's proposal to retain private counsel of his choosing and, taking into account the quashing of the previous appeal decision on the grounds of a lack of legal assistance, rejected the applicant's objection to the counsel's assistance. Accordingly, Ms A. represented the applicant in the appeal hearing. 30.On the same day the Supreme Court examined the merits of the case. It upheld the judgment of the Novosibirsk Regional Court of 20 December 2001, making one correction to the text and excluding one piece of evidence. The substantive findings and the applicant's sentence remained unchanged. 31.Article 51 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation (in force from 1 July 2002) provides for mandatory legal representation if the accused faces serious charges carrying a term of imprisonment exceeding fifteen years, life imprisonment or the death penalty. Unless counsel is retained by the accused, it is the responsibility of the investigator, prosecutor or the court to appoint legal-aid counsel. Article52 of the Code provides that the accused can waive his right to legal assistance, but such waiver must be established in the written form. The waiver can be revoked at any moment. 32.Article 373 of the Code provides that the appellate court (суд кассационной инстанции) examines appeals (кассационные жалобы) with a view to verifying the lawfulness, validity and fairness of judgments. Under Article 377 §§ 4 and 5 of the Code, it may directly examine evidence, including additional material submitted by parties. 33.Article 402 of the Code (“Appeal against judgments, decisions and rulings which have come into force”) stipulates as follows: “1.Defendants who have been convicted or acquitted, ... and the public prosecutor shall be entitled to request review of court judgments ... which have come into force in accordance with the procedure set out in the present Chapter.>The public prosecutor's request shall be termed a supervisory-review application (представление). Other parties' requests shall be termed supervisory-review complaints (жалоба).” 34.Article 406 of the Code (“Examination of supervisory-review complaints or applications”) stipulates as follows: “1.A supervisory-review complaint or application shall be examined by a supervisory-review court within 30 days of being lodged.>The judge who examines the supervisory-review complaint or application may, where necessary, obtain ... any criminal case file ...>After examining the supervisory-review complaint or application, the judge shall decide as follows: either (i)to dismiss the supervisory-review complaint or application; or, (ii)to institute supervisory-review proceedings and to pass the supervisory-review complaint or application for consideration to the supervisory-review court ...>The President of the [competent] court may decline to accept the judge's decision to dismiss the supervisory-review complaint or application. In this case he shall set aside this decision and give a decision according to paragraph 3 (ii) [above].” 35.Article 412 of the Code (“Lodging of new supervisory-review complaints or applications”) stipulates as follows: “1.It is forbidden to lodge new supervisory-review complaints or applications with a court which has already dismissed such complaints or applications.>Where an earlier judgment, decision or ruling has been quashed on appeal or under the supervisory-review procedure, it is possible to lodge a supervisory-review complaint or application against it in accordance with the rules of the present Chapter, irrespective of the reasons why the original judgment, decision or ruling was quashed.” Article 413 of the Code, setting out the procedure for re-opening of criminal cases, reads, in so far as relevant, as follows: “1.Court judgments and decisions which became final should be quashed and proceedings in a criminal case should be re-opened due to new or newly discovered circumstances. ...>New circumstances are: ... (2)a violation of a provision of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms committed by a court of the during examination of a criminal case and established by the European Court of Human Rights, pertaining to: (a)application of a federal law which runs contrary to provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; (b)other violations of provisions of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; ....” B.Case-law of the and of the Supreme Court of Russia 36.Examining the compatibility of Article 51 of the Code of Criminal Procedure with the Constitution, the ruled as follows (decision no. 497-O of 18 December 2003): “Article 51 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which describes the circumstances in which the participation of defence counsel is mandatory, does not contain any indication that its requirements are not applicable in appeal proceedings or that the convict's right to legal assistance in such proceedings may be restricted.” “Article 51 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which describes the circumstances in which the participation of defence counsel is mandatory, does not contain any indication that its requirements are not applicable in appeal proceedings or that the convict's right to legal assistance in such proceedings may be restricted.” 37.That position was subsequently confirmed and developed in seven decisions delivered by the on 8 February 2007. It found that free legal assistance for the purpose of appellate proceedings should be provided in the same conditions as for earlier stages in the proceedings and that it was mandatory in the situations listed in Article 51. It further underlined the obligation of courts to secure participation of defence counsel in appeal proceedings. 37.That position was subsequently confirmed and developed in seven decisions delivered by the on 8 February 2007. It found that free legal assistance for the purpose of appellate proceedings should be provided in the same conditions as for earlier stages in the proceedings and that it was mandatory in the situations listed in Article 51. It further underlined the obligation of courts to secure participation of defence counsel in appeal proceedings. 38.On 18 December 2003 the Constitutional Court of Russia dismissed a constitutional complaint by Mr R. as inadmissible. In its ruling (определение) the held inter alia that Article 51 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which defined situations where participation of a defence lawyer in the criminal proceedings was mandatory, also applied to the proceedings before the court of appeal. 39.In a number of cases (decisions of 13 October 2004 and 26 January, 9 February, 6 April, 15 June and 21 December 2005, 24 May and 18October 2006, 17 January 2007, 3 September and 15 October 2008) the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation quashed judgments of appeal courts and remitted cases for fresh consideration on the ground that the courts had failed to secure the presence of defence counsel in the appeal proceedings, although it was obligatory for the accused to be legally represented. That approach was also confirmed by the Presidium of the Supreme Court in its report concerning cases adopted in the third quarter of 2005 (Decree of 23 November 2005) and by the Decree of the Plenary of the Supreme Court of 23 December 2008, as amended on 30 June 2009. In the later document the Supreme Court emphasised that the accused could waive his right to a lawyer only in writing, and that the court was not bound by that waiver.",2010,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

172,001-58560,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicants live in the villages of Villigen, Würenlingen, Böttstein and Kleindöttingen, situated in zone 1 in the vicinity of unit II of a nuclear power plant in Beznau (Canton of Aargau). They either own or rent property. The Beznau II nuclear power plant consists of a dual-loop pressurised water reactor. The site is situated five kilometres from the German border. 10.On 18 December 1991, the Nordostschweizerische Kraftwerke AG (“NOK”), a private company which had operated the nuclear power plant since 1971, applied to the Swiss Federal Council (the government) for an extension of its operating licence for an indefinite period. The application was supported by a technical report and a safety analysis report established by NOK. The application and these reports were published in the Official Journal (Amtsblatt) of the Canton of Aargau of 27 January 1992 and in the Official Gazette of 28 January 1992 together with a notice inviting persons satisfying the requirements laid down by sections 6 and 48 of the Federal Administrative Proceedings Act (see paragraph 28 below) to file an objection. 11.By 28 April 1992 more than 18,400 objections were lodged by virtue of these provisions with the Federal Energy Office, a large part of which came from Germany and Austria. More than 99% of the objections were photocopies. 12.In their objections the complainants requested the Federal Council to refuse an extension of the operating licence and to order the immediate and permanent closure of the nuclear power plant. They attached an expert opinion of the Institute for Applied Ecology (Öko-Institut – Institut für angewandte Ökologie e. V.) in Darmstadt, Germany, to their objections, namely a report of April 1992 on selected aspects of the safety analysis report produced by NOK in December 1991. Relying in particular on section 5(1) of the Nuclear Energy Act (see paragraph 22 below), they opposed the application for an extension of the operating licence because of the risks which they maintained such an extension entailed for their rights to life, to physical integrity and of property. According to them, the nuclear power plant did not meet current safety standards on account of serious and irremediable construction defects and, owing to its condition, the risk of an accident occurring was greater than usual. They also requested that in the meantime certain provisional measures be taken. The complainants also disputed the impartiality of the administrative bodies involved in the proceedings. With regard to the fact that under the applicable law the Federal Council would consider the application for an operating licence as an authority of both first and last instance, they invoked their right of access to a court, as guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. 13.On 5 February 1993 the Federal Department of Transport, Communications and Energy, as the competent body deciding prior to the decision of the Federal Council, rejected the requests for provisional measures. 14.On 12 December 1994 the Federal Council dismissed all the objections as being unfounded and granted NOK a limited operating licence expiring on 31 December 2004. The licence was subject to compliance with various specific conditions concerning, for instance, threshold levels for radioactive substances, tests of the safeguard system, improvements of the feedwater system, a systematic programme, specific to the Beznau II nuclear power plant, for ageing surveillance and various other continuous technical improvements of the plant. NOK was also requested to submit periodically updated safety reports. 15.In its decision the Federal Council relied on a safety evaluation report established by the Swiss Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (Hauptabteilung für die Sicherheit der Kernanlagen – “HSK”). The report gave the results from the point of view of nuclear safety and radiation protection, including conclusions and proposals for licence conditions to be formulated in the licensing decision. The Federal Council further relied on an opinion of the Nuclear Technology and Safety Section of the Federal Energy Office, a statement of the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Commission (Eidgenössische Kommission für die Sicherheit von Kernanlagen – “KSA”) on basic aspects of the application and on the safety evaluation report of the HSK and the view expressed by the cantonal authorities. With regard to the complainants living in Austria, the Federal Council considered that these persons had no locus standi on the ground that they were not exposed to a significantly higher risk than that existing for the population in general, in view of the distance between the nuclear power plant and the Swiss-Austrian border. As to the remaining complainants, the Federal Council was satisfied that certain complainants lived in zone 1 around the nuclear power plant and were therefore entitled to take part in the proceedings. The Federal Council observed that although power stations built twenty years earlier certainly no longer met current technical standards, they could nonetheless be maintained and modernised so that they could continue to operate quite safely. In order to satisfy itself that this was so in the case under review, the Federal Council considered each of the objections in turn. It examined in particular the complainants' objections relating to the emergency cooling system and the residual heat removal, the emergency feed system, the reactor containment and pressure-limiting system, the fire-protection, the emergency power supply, the emergency boronising system, the control circuits and outside influences, such as plane crashes and actions by third parties. The Federal Council observed that since the Beznau II nuclear power plant had come into operation various backfittings to improve the safety of the power plant had been carried out. It referred to the emergency standby system and improved power supply system (NANO), put into operation in 1992, and the filtered containment venting system. Furthermore the results of the probabilistic safety analysis carried out at the Beznau II nuclear power plant showed that a nuclear accident was unlikely. The Federal Council gave detailed reasons why it found the objections to be unfounded and concluded that on the basis of the evidence submitted no relevant deficiencies could be established. The Federal Council further pointed out that an assessment of the organisation, management and staff situation at the Beznau II nuclear power plant presented a positive overall picture. The Federal Council further observed that by voting against the popular initiative of 23 September 1990 (see paragraphs 20-21 below) “For the Progressive Abandonment of Nuclear Energy” the Swiss people and the majority of the cantons had expressed the wish to continue using nuclear energy. With regard to the complaint based on the right to life, the Federal Council pointed out that this right was protected by the Constitution and drew attention to the position under the Federal Court's case-law, whereby only deliberate infringements could constitute a breach of that right. That did not apply to the operation of a nuclear power plant, at least so long as appropriate technical and operating procedures were adopted to prevent such an infringement and so long as these could reasonably be considered to provide a level of protection comparable to that existing in other generally accepted technical installations. With regard to the reactor accident at Chernobyl, the Federal Council stated that the reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was technically not comparable to a light-water reactor like that of the Beznau II power plant. Furthermore the Chernobyl reactor had never undergone a safety review process as normally carried out in western countries. The Chernobyl power plant was therefore not relevant in the context of the assessment of the risks of western nuclear power plants. The Federal Council also pointed out that, in accordance with the Agreement of 10 August 1982 between the government of the Swiss Confederation and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on mutual information on the construction and operation of nuclear installations in the vicinity of the border, the German authorities had been provided with the relevant documents relating to the requested operating licence for the Beznau II power plant. From the beginning, this subject had been discussed during the sessions of the German-Swiss Commission on the Safety of Nuclear Installations (Deutsch-Schweizerische Kommission für die Sicherheit kerntechnischer Einrichtungen – “DSK”). In its report adopted at its session held from 5 to 7 October 1994 this commission had expressed the view that, if the terms of the licence were observed, the Beznau II nuclear power plant would operate safely. There would be no risk for the population of the Federal Republic of Germany. 16.Following the decision of the Federal Council, the Beznau II nuclear power plant, like all the Swiss nuclear installations, was subject to official surveillance by the HSK in all matters regarding nuclear safety and radiation protection. The HSK presented annual reports giving a concise evaluation of the conditions and standards of operation of the Beznau II power plant. It followed from these reports that the condition of the power plant with regard to nuclear safety and radiation protection and also to its operation had been rated as good. It followed in particular from the annual report of 1997 that the notifiable incidents which had occurred were of minor relevance to nuclear safety. Appropriate improvements had been carried out. However, further efforts were needed in order to recognise problems in the area of human behaviour and organisational management. Since 1996, the Beznau II power plant had followed an ageing surveillance programme as a permanent task for its safety-relevant plant components. The relevant documentation examined by the HSK had not revealed any safety-relevant gaps in the maintenance programmes. Furthermore, these results indicated that no unacceptable reduction in safety-related properties was to be expected in the near future. As to the requirements in connection with the operating licence of 12 December 1994 the HSK stated that all conditions which were associated with deadlines had been complied with and some conditions had in part to be updated periodically with respect to plant documentation and analyses. 17.From 13 November to 1 December 1995 a mission of the Operational Safety Assessment Review Team (OSART) from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was conducted at the Beznau II power plant. The experts noted especially “the stringent requirements with regard to quality and safety, the professional qualities of the staff at all levels as well as the very satisfactory condition of the Beznau II nuclear power plant”, but recommended additional safety improvements. 18.On 15 December 1997 the applicants submitted an expert report of 26 November 1997 drawn up by the Institute for Applied Ecology in Darmstadt. According to that report, the licence at issue continued to tolerate the serious safety deficiencies which had already been mentioned in the institute's previous expert reports of 1992 and 1994. It was stated that the modernisation which was both technically possible and had been required in the case of pressurised water reactors of the same generation had not been carried out. All the safety systems installed at the Beznau II nuclear power plant for the purpose of preventing nuclear accidents were very seriously flawed compared with more modern pressurised water reactors in central Europe. The report criticised, for example, the safety systems for their failure to ensure that the back-up components were physically separate and protected from fire; the standard of the emergency cooling system and residual heat removal compared to modern light water pressure reactors in central Europe; the unsatisfactory emergency power supply concerning certain components that were important for the safety of the plant; the design of the emergency power supply itself with regard to back-up and separation from the main system; the emergency feed system not satisfying the standards applying to modern pressurised water reactors; the deficiency of the emergency boronated water system, the purpose of which was to ensure that the pressurised water reactor was switched off until it was cold; the reactor containment in case the active pressure-limiting process could not be carried out successfully; the design of the pressure-limiting systems themselves and the deficiency of the control circuits with regard to the back-up system, physical separation, the main and emergency power supply, the fail-safe mechanism and the production of readings. Moreover, the lack of protection against outside influences rendered the plant much more vulnerable to a plane crash or to action by third parties. In spite of the fact that it was a condition for the granting of the licence that parts of the plant be modernised, no demand had been made for an actual emergency system, such as was required for the more recent western European pressurised water reactors. The report compared the attitude adopted in the last few years to older, Westinghouse-type, first-generation pressurised water reactors by the supervisory authorities in various countries of Europe, the USA and Japan and reached the conclusion that the standards applied in the licensing procedure at issue were far below those applying in other central European countries – i.e. risks were accepted that would no longer be tolerated in other countries. The report further referred to the OSART mission which was conducted in 1995 and the criticism expressed by the experts with regard to the organisational structures and management at the Beznau II power plant. According to the report, such deficiencies not only created an increased risk of accident but gave rise to concern with regard to the effectiveness of damage limitation and emergency protection in the event of serious malfunctions at the power station. 19.From 30 November to 11 December 1998 a team of eleven experts of the International Regulatory Review Team (IRRT) reviewed the working methods of the HSK. During the mission six members of the team also visited the Beznau II nuclear power plant. In their report of January 1999 the reviewers identified “a number of good practices which had been recorded for the benefit of other nuclear regulatory bodies”. They also made recommendations and suggestions which indicated where improvements were necessary or desirable to further strengthen the regulatory body in Switzerland. 20.Article 139 of the Federal Constitution of 18 April 1999 (formerly Articles 118, 121 to 123 of the Federal Constitution of 29 May 1874) provides that 100,000 citizens may seek, by way of a constitutional or popular initiative, an amendment to the Constitution on any topic. Popular initiatives do not originate from Parliament or the government, but from the citizens themselves. 21.On 18 February 1979 the popular initiative on the “Safeguard of the People's Rights and the Safety of the Construction and Operation of Nuclear Installations” was rejected by a majority of the people and the cantons. In 1981 the popular initiative “For the Interruption of the Nuclear Power Programme” failed, because the necessary 100,000 signatures could not be collected within eighteen months. On 23 September 1984 the people and the cantons rejected the initiative “For a Future without Further Nuclear Power Plants”. On 23 September 1990 the popular initiative “Stop the Construction of Nuclear Power Plants (Moratorium)” was adopted, while on the same date the initiative “For the Progressive Abandonment of Nuclear Energy” was rejected. Two further popular initiatives “Moratorium-Plus – for the Extension of the Moratorium concerning the Construction of Nuclear Power Plants and the Limitation of the Nuclear Risk” and “Get out of Nuclear Power – For a Change in the Field of Energy and for the Progressive Closing-Down of Nuclear Power Plants (Get out of Nuclear Power)”, filed on 28 September 1999, are still pending. 22.Under section 4(1)(a) of the Federal Act of 23 December 1959 on the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy (“the Nuclear Energy Act”), a licence from the Confederation is required for the construction and operation of nuclear installations and for any changes in the purpose, nature or scale of such installations. Section 5(1) provides that a licence must be refused or granted subject to appropriate conditions or obligations if that is necessary in order, in particular, to protect people, the property of others or important rights. Section 6 provides that the Federal Council or a body designated by it decides licence applications. No appeal lies against its decisions. Section 8 stipulates that nuclear installations and every form of ownership of radioactive nuclear fuels and residues shall be placed under federal supervision; the Federal Council and the body designated by it shall have the right in executing their supervisory function to issue instructions at any time if that becomes necessary in order, in particular, to protect people, the property of others and important rights; they are also entitled to supervise compliance with these instructions. 23.Under the Federal Court's case-law, the safety of nuclear power plants can be considered by the Confederation only in the context of its licensing procedures (Judgments of the Federal Court (ATF), vol. 119 Ia, p.402). 24.In addition to the previously required authorisations, Article 1 of the federal order of 6 October 1978 concerning the Nuclear Energy Act requires a general licence of the Federal Council for all nuclear installations as a prerequisite for granting construction and operating licences. The Federal Council has the exclusive competence to grant licences. The procedure for the granting of the general licence requires, according to Article5, publication of the application and, according to Article 7, publication of the comments and expert opinions on the application. The licensing decision is based on the conclusions of the safety authorities reached at the end of the detailed review and assessment of the safety analysis report, of the probabilistic safety analysis, and of additional documents that may be requested from the applicant (see paragraphs 25 and 26 below). 25.The ordinance of 14 March 1983, which deals with the regulation of nuclear installations, entrusts the HSK with the regulatory role. The ordinance formally establishes the HSK as the competent authority for supervising nuclear installations as long as they exist, including inspections of nuclear power plants. The HSK supervises the operators, and assesses the nuclear safety and radiation protection of nuclear power plants. It proposes guidelines which are of a directional nature for the operators. Within the framework of the licensing process, the HSK assesses in detail the application and the safety analysis report submitted by the applicant. The objective of this assessment is to verify compliance with the relevant regulations and guidelines. In this work, the HSK also has to take into account the established international standard of science and technology. The results and insights of the review and assessment are documented in a safety evaluation report. This report is used by the Federal Council as a basis for deciding upon the approval of applications made by the operator of a nuclear power plant. The HSK provides information on aspects of nuclear safety and radiation protection in Swiss nuclear power plants as well as on its own activities and also draws up annual reports. After the granting of a licence, the design and construction of the existing nuclear power plants are reassessed periodically, both in the case of incidents and during normal operation. Safety reviews have to be performed at intervals of about ten years. Deficiencies in the nuclear power plants, when compared to the current state of science and technology, have to be assessed. If they affect the safety, they have to be eliminated by means of appropriate backfitting. The HSK is independent from any organisation concerned with the promotion or utilisation of nuclear energy. Although it is part of the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication and attached to the Federal Energy Office, at the technical level the HSK acts independently from the rest of the Office and from the Federal Department. The legally required review and assessment of applications through the HSK is conducted solely on the basis of nuclear safety criteria to the exclusion of any other considerations. 26.According to section 1 of this ordinance of 14 March 1983, the KSA is an advisory body to the Federal Council and the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication. It is administratively attached to the Federal Office of Energy. Section 2 provides that the KSA gives its opinion on licence applications and on whether necessary and supportable measures to protect persons and the environment against the hazards of ionising radiation are taken, and whether such measures are in conformity with experience and with the state of science and technology. The role of the KSA is to bring in additional professional expertise from outside the administration and to provide a second opinion to the federal government. The KSA reports directly to the Federal Council. It is therefore independent from other governmental bodies concerned with the use of nuclear energy. 27.Section 97 of the Federal Judicature Act of 16 December 1943 provides that the Federal Court hears, as a final court of appeal, administrative-law appeals against decisions of the federal authorities. However, by virtue of section 100(u) no appeal lies in matters of nuclear energy against decisions concerning licences for nuclear installations and preparatory acts. 28.Section 6 of the Federal Administrative Proceedings Act of 20December 1968 provides that the persons whose rights could be affected by the decision which will be given are considered as parties, as well as those persons, organisations or authorities who have the right to appeal against that decision. Section 44 lays down the principle that an appeal lies against administrative decisions. By section 46, however, an appeal is inadmissible in particular if it is made against a decision against which an administrative-law appeal lies to the Federal Court or against final decisions given in accordance with other federal laws. Under section 48(a) a person has locus standi to appeal if he is affected by the decision and has an interest worthy of protection in having the decision set aside or varied. 29.Article 28 of the Civil Code protects the right to the integrity of the person while actions for nuisance are governed by Article 28 (a). Other relevant provisions of the Civil Code read as follows: Article 679 “Any person who sustains or is exposed to damage because an owner abuses his right may bring an action against that owner requiring him to restore the previous position or to take preventive measures, without prejudice to any damages.” Article 684 “1.When exercising their right, especially when carrying on industrial processes, owners are required to refrain from acting in a manner detrimental to neighbouring properties.>The following, in particular, are prohibited: emissions of smoke or soot, offensive smells, noises, and vibrations which are harmful and exceed the limits of the tolerance which neighbours must show to each other having regard to local custom and the situation and type of the buildings.” 30.By virtue of section 1 of the Federal Expropriation Act of 20 June 1930, expropriations may be carried out “for the purposes of works that are in the interest of the Confederation or of a substantial area of the country and for any other public-interest aim recognised by federal law”. Section 5(1) provides: “The following may be expropriated: rights in rem over land, rights arising from land ownership that concern relations between owners and occupiers of adjacent premises and the rights in personam of tenants or farmers of the property to be expropriated.” 31.With regard to the latter provision, the Federal Court has held: “Actions brought under Articles 679 and 684 to 686 [of the Civil Code] ... are included among the rights which may be expropriated under section 5 ... If the emissions or other allegedly adverse effects result from the construction, in accordance with the applicable law, of a building in the public interest for which land has been expropriated, or are the consequence of using the building for its intended purpose, no private-law action lies for the purpose of obtaining an injunction or compensation. A claim for compensation for expropriation replaces the cause of action under private law and must be made to the expropriations judge, who has jurisdiction not only to assess compensation but also to rule on whether the right ... exists. An expropriating authority's refusal to commence proceedings may be challenged, at last instance, by means of an administrative-law appeal to the Federal Court.” (ATF, vol.116 Ib, p. 253) In another judgment the Federal Court held: “By virtue of section 5 ..., rights arising from land ownership that concern relations between owners and occupiers of adjacent premises may be expropriated and be forfeited or restricted, temporarily or permanently, provided that the proportionality principle is complied with ...” (ATF, vol. 119 Ib, p. 341) 32.Section 5 of the Act has been applied in the case of people living near very busy main roads who were concerned about pollution from exhaust fumes (ATF, vol. 118 Ib, p. 205). Under the Federal Court's caselaw, compensation is awarded if the nuisance was not foreseeable and resulted in substantial damage and if the owner suffered special loss (loc. cit., p. 205). In order to assess foreseeability, it is necessary to determine whether the owner could reasonably have known of the future nuisance when he became the owner of the property (ATF, vol. 111 Ib, p. 234).",2000,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

174,001-99015,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicant was born in 1975 and is currently detained in Schwalmstadt Prison, Germany. 10.J. was the youngest son of a banking family in Frankfurt am Main. He got to know the applicant, a law student, as an acquaintance of his sister. 11.On 27 September 2002 the applicant lured J., aged 11, into his flat in Frankfurt am Main by pretending that the child’s sister had left a jacket there. He then killed the boy by suffocating him. 12.Subsequently, the applicant deposited a ransom note at J.’s parents’ place of residence stating that J. had been kidnapped and demanding onemillion euros. The note further stated that if the kidnappers received the ransom and managed to leave the country, then the child’s parents would see their son again. The applicant then drove to a pond located on a private property near Birstein, approximately one hour’s drive from Frankfurt, and hid J.’s corpse under a jetty. 13.On 30 September 2002 at around 1 a.m. the applicant picked up the ransom at a tram station. From then on he was under police surveillance. He paid part of the ransom money into his bank accounts and hid the remainder of the money in his flat. That afternoon, he was arrested at Frankfurt am Main airport with the police pinning him face down on the ground. 14.After having been examined by a doctor at the airport’s hospital on account of shock and skin lesions, the applicant was taken to the Frankfurt am Main police headquarters. He was informed by detective officer M. that he was suspected of having kidnapped J. and was instructed about his rights as a defendant, notably the right to remain silent and to consult a lawyer. He was then questioned by M. with a view to finding J. Meanwhile, the police, having searched the applicant’s flat, found half of the ransom money and a note concerning the planning of the crime. The applicant intimated that the child was being held by another kidnapper. At 11.30 p.m. he was allowed to consult a lawyer, Z., for thirty minutes at his request. He subsequently indicated that F.R. and M.R. had kidnapped the boy and had hidden him in a hut by a lake. 15.Early in the morning of 1 October 2002, before M. came to work, MrDaschner (“D.”), deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, ordered another officer, Mr Ennigkeit (“E.”), to threaten the applicant with considerable physical pain, and, if necessary, to subject him to such pain in order to make him reveal the boy’s whereabouts. D.’s subordinate heads of department had previously and repeatedly opposed such a measure (see also paragraph 47 below). Detective officer E. thereupon threatened the applicant with subjection to considerable pain at the hands of a person specially trained for such purposes if he did not disclose the child’s whereabouts. According to the applicant, the officer further threatened to lock him in a cell with two huge black men who would sexually abuse him. The officer also hit him several times on the chest with his hand and shook him so that, on one occasion, his head hit the wall. The Government disputed that the applicant had been threatened with sexual abuse or had been physically assaulted during the questioning. 16.For fear of being exposed to the measures he was threatened with, the applicant disclosed the whereabouts of J.’s body after approximately ten minutes. 17.The applicant was then driven with M. and numerous other police officers to Birstein. He had refused to go with detective officer E. The police waited for a video camera to be brought to the scene. Then, the applicant, on the communicated order of the police officer in command and while being filmed, pointed out the precise location of the body. The police found J.’s corpse under the jetty at the pond near Birstein as indicated by the applicant. The applicant claimed that he had been obliged to walk without shoes through woods to where he had left the corpse and, on the orders of the police, he had had to point out its precise location. The Government disputed that the applicant had had to walk without shoes. 18.Upon forensic examination of the scene, the police discovered tyre tracks left by the applicant’s car near the pond near Birstein. Under questioning by detective officer M. on the return journey from Birstein the applicant confessed to having kidnapped and killed J. He was then taken by the police to various other locations indicated by him where they secured J.’s school exercise books, a backpack, J.’s clothes and a typewriter used for the blackmail letter in containers. An autopsy carried out on J.’s corpse on 2October 2002 confirmed that J. had died of suffocation. 19.Having returned to the police station, the applicant was then permitted to consult his lawyer, En., who had been instructed to act on his behalf by his mother and who had tried, in vain, to contact and advise the applicant earlier that morning. 20.In a note for the police file dated 1 October 2002, the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., stated that he believed that that morning J.’s life had been in great danger, if he was still alive at all, given his lack of food and the temperature outside. In order to save the child’s life, he had therefore ordered the applicant to be threatened by detective officer E. with considerable pain which would not leave any trace of injury. He confirmed that the treatment itself was to be carried out under medical supervision. D. further admitted that he had ordered another police officer to obtain a “truth serum” to be administered to the applicant. According to the note, the threat to the applicant was exclusively aimed at saving the child’s life rather than furthering the criminal proceedings concerning the kidnapping. As the applicant had disclosed the whereabouts of J.’s body, having been threatened with pain, no measures had in fact been carried out. 21.A medical certificate issued by a police doctor on 4 October 2002 confirmed that the applicant had a haematoma (7 cm x 5 cm) below his left collarbone, skin lesions and blood scabs on his left arm and his knees and swellings on his feet. A further medical certificate dated 7 October 2002 noted that, following an examination of the applicant on 2 October 2002, two haematomas on the left-hand side of the applicant’s chest of a diameter of around 5 cm and 4 cm were confirmed, together with superficial skin lesions or blood scabs on his left arm, his knees and his right leg and closed blisters on his feet. According to the certificate, these discreet traces of injuries indicated that the injuries had been caused a few days before the examination. The precise cause of the injuries could not be diagnosed. 22.During subsequent questioning by the police on 4 October 2002, by a public prosecutor on 4, 14 and 17 October 2002, and by a district court judge on 30 January 2003 the applicant confirmed the confession he had made on 1 October 2002. 23.In January 2003 the Frankfurt am Main public prosecutor’s office opened criminal investigation proceedings against the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., and detective officer E. on the basis of the applicant’s allegations that he had been threatened on 1 October 2002.>The proceedings in the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court 24.On 9 April 2003, the first day of the hearing, the applicant, represented by counsel, lodged a preliminary application for the proceedings to be discontinued. The basis of his claim was that during interrogation and prior to confessing he had been threatened by detective officer E. with being subjected to severe pain and sexual abuse. He argued that this treatment had been in breach of Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 61 below) and Article 3 of the Convention and warranted the discontinuation of the proceedings against him. 25.The applicant also lodged an alternative preliminary application seeking a declaration that, owing to the continuous effect (Fortwirkung) of the threat of violence against him on 1 October 2002, all statements which he had made to the investigation authorities should not be relied upon in the criminal proceedings. Moreover, the applicant sought a declaration that on account of the violation of Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the use in the criminal proceedings of all items of evidence, such as the child’s corpse, which had become known to the investigation authorities because of the confession extracted – the so-called “fruit of the poisonous tree” – was prohibited (Fernwirkung). 26.On 9 April 2003, in response to the first preliminary application, the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s application for the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings. The court noted that in the applicant’s submission, detective officer E. had threatened that a specialist was on his way to the police station by helicopter who, without leaving any traces, would inflict on him intolerable pain the likes of which he had never before experienced, if he continued to refuse to disclose J.’s whereabouts. To underpin the threat, E. had imitated the sound of the rotating blades of a helicopter. E. had further threatened that the applicant would be locked up in a cell with two big “Negroes” who would anally assault him. He would wish that he had never been born. The court found as a fact that the applicant had been threatened with the infliction of considerable pain if he refused to disclose the victim’s whereabouts. However, the court did not find it established that the applicant had also been threatened with sexual abuse or had been otherwise influenced. The threat to inflict pain upon the applicant had been illegal pursuant to Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and also pursuant to Article 1 and Article 104 § 1 of the Basic Law (see paragraphs 59-60 below) and in violation of Article 3 of the Convention. 27.However, notwithstanding this breach of the applicant’s constitutional rights, the court found that the criminal proceedings were not, in consequence, barred and could proceed. It found that the use of the investigation methods in question, though prohibited in law, had not so restricted the rights of the defence that the criminal proceedings could not be pursued. In view of the seriousness of the charges against the applicant on the one hand, and the severity of the unlawful conduct during investigation on the other, there had not been such an exceptional and intolerable violation of the rule of law as to bar the continuation of the criminal proceedings. 28.In response to the applicant’s second preliminary application, the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court found that, in accordance with Article136a § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, all confessions and statements hitherto made by the applicant before the police, a public prosecutor and a district court judge were inadmissible as evidence in the criminal proceedings because they had been obtained through the use of prohibited methods of interrogation. 29.The court found that on 1 October 2002 detective officer E. had used prohibited methods of interrogation within the meaning of Article 136a § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by threatening the applicant with intolerable pain if he did not disclose the child’s whereabouts. Therefore, any statements which the applicant had made as a consequence of this forbidden investigative measure were inadmissible as evidence. This exclusion of evidence (Beweisverwertungsverbot) did not only comprise the statements made immediately after the unlawful threat. It covered all further statements which the applicant had made to the investigation authorities since that date in view of the continuous effect of the violation of Article136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 30.The procedural irregularity caused by the use of a prohibited method of investigation could only have been remedied if the applicant had been informed before his subsequent questioning that his earlier statements made as a consequence of the threat of pain could not be used as evidence against him. However, the applicant had only been instructed about his right not to testify, without having been informed about the inadmissibility of the evidence that had been improperly obtained. He had therefore not been given the necessary “qualified instruction” (qualifizierte Belehrung) before making further statements. 31.However, the court limited the inadmissible evidence to the above-mentioned statements. It went on to dismiss the applicant’s application for a declaration that, on account of the prohibited investigation methods, the use in the criminal proceedings of all items of evidence, such as the child’s corpse, which had become known to the investigation authorities as a consequence of the statements extracted from the applicant ought to be excluded from trial (Fernwirkung). The court found as follows: “... there is no long-range effect of the breach of Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure meaning that the items of evidence which have become known as a result of the statement may likewise not be used [as evidence]. The Chamber agrees in this respect with the conciliatory view (Mittelmeinung) taken by scholars and in court rulings ... according to which a balancing [of interests] in the particular circumstances of the case had to be carried out, taking into account, in particular, whether there had been a flagrant violation of the legal order, notably of provisions on fundamental rights, and according to which the seriousness of the offence investigated also had to be considered. Balancing the severity of the interference with the defendant’s fundamental rights – in the present case the threat of physical violence – and the seriousness of the offence he was charged with and which had to be investigated – the completed murder of a child – makes the exclusion of evidence which has become known as a result of the defendant’s statement – in particular the discovery of the dead child and the results of the autopsy – appear disproportionate.” 32.Following the above ruling on the applicant’s preliminary applications lodged on the opening day of the trial, the proceedings continued. The next day, in his statement on the charges, the applicant admitted having killed J., but stated that he had not initially intended to do so. His defence counsel submitted that by confessing, the applicant wanted to take responsibility for his offence notwithstanding the interrogation methods used on 1 October 2002. As the trial proceeded, all further items of evidence found as a consequence of the applicant’s original statement and which the applicant sought to have excluded were adduced. At the close of the trial on 28 July 2003 the applicant admitted that he had also intended from the outset to kill the child. He described his second confession as “the only way to accept his deep guilt” and as the “greatest possible apology for the murder of the child”. 33.On 28 July 2003 the convicted the applicant, inter alia, of murder and kidnapping with extortion causing the death of the victim. It sentenced him to life imprisonment and declared that his guilt was of particular gravity, warranting a maximum sentence (see paragraph 63 below). 34.The court found that at the hearing the applicant had been instructed anew about his right to remain silent and about the fact that none of his earlier statements could be used as evidence against him and had thereby been given the necessary qualified instruction. However, the applicant had, following the qualified instruction, confessed that he had kidnapped and killed J. His statements at the trial concerning the planning of his offence formed the essential, if not the only, basis for the court’s findings of fact. They were corroborated by the testimony of J.’s sister, the blackmail letter and the note concerning the planning of the crime found in the applicant’s flat. The findings of fact concerning the execution of the crime were exclusively based on the applicant’s confession at the trial. Further items of evidence showed that he had told the truth also in this respect. These included the findings of the autopsy as to the cause of the child’s death, the tyre tracks left by the applicant’s car near the pond where the child’s corpse had been found, and the discovery of money from the ransom which had been found in his flat or paid into his accounts. 35.In assessing the gravity of the applicant’s guilt, the court observed that he had killed his 11-year-old victim and demanded one million euros in ransom in order to preserve his self-created image of a rich and successful young lawyer. It did not share the views expressed by the public prosecutor’s office and the private accessory prosecutors that the applicant’s confession “was worth nothing” as the applicant had only confessed to what had in any event already been proven. The fact that the applicant had volunteered a full confession at the trial, even though all his earlier confessions could not be used as evidence pursuant to Article 136a § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, was a mitigating factor. However, even without his confession, the applicant would have been found guilty of kidnapping with extortion causing the death of the victim. The applicant had been kept under police surveillance after he had collected the ransom, which had later been found in his flat or paid into his accounts. Furthermore, it had been proved by the autopsy on J.’s corpse that the boy had been suffocated, and tyre tracks left by the applicant’s car had been detected at the place where J.’s body had been found. 36.The court further observed that in questioning the applicant, methods of interrogation prohibited under Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been employed. Whether and to what extent detective officer E. and the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., were guilty of an offence because of these threats had to be determined in the criminal investigations then pending against them. However, their allegedly illegal acts did not mitigate the applicant’s own guilt. The misconduct of police officers, belonging to the executive power, could not prevent the judiciary from assessing findings of fact in accordance with the law. 37.On the day following his conviction, the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Federal Court of Justice. He complained that the , in its decision of 9 April 2003, had refused his preliminary application to discontinue the criminal proceedings against him. It had further refused to declare that the use in the criminal proceedings of all other items of evidence, such as the child’s corpse, which had become known to the investigation authorities because of the statements unlawfully extracted was prohibited. The applicant included a full copy of these applications of 9 April 2003, including the grounds given for them. He further included a copy of the Regional Court’s decision of 9 April 2003 dismissing his application for the proceedings to be discontinued and argued in respect of the police’s threats of torture against him that, developing the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, such conduct “leapt beyond” the exclusion of evidence and led to an impediment to the proceedings (dass ein derartiges Verhalten das Verwertungsverbot “überspringt” und ein Verfahrenshindernis begründet). 38.In his observations dated 9 March 2004 the Federal Public Prosecutor objected that the applicant’s appeal on points of law was manifestly ill-founded. He argued that the use of prohibited methods of interrogation did not lead to an impediment to the criminal proceedings. Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure expressly provided that the use of any of the prohibited methods enumerated entailed only the exclusion of evidence. The applicant had not complained of a breach of Article 136a §3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In any event, there would be no grounds for such a complaint as the Regional Court had only used the applicant’s confession at the trial, which he had made after having been informed that his previous statements had not been admitted as evidence. 39.On 21 May 2004 the Federal Court of Justice, without giving further reasons, dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as ill-founded. 40.On 23 June 2004 the applicant lodged a complaint with the . Summarising the facts underlying the case and the content of the impugned decisions, he complained under Article 1 § 1 and Article 104 § 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law about the way in which he had been questioned by the police on the morning of 1 October 2002. He argued that he had been threatened with being subjected to torture and sexual abuse if he did not disclose the child’s whereabouts. In the circumstances of the case, this treatment amounted to torture within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention and infringed Article 104 § 1 of the Basic Law. It also violated his absolute right to human dignity under Article1 of the Basic Law, which lay at the heart of the provisions in question. These unjustifiable human rights violations ought to have been a bar to the criminal proceedings for murder and a prohibition on using the evidence obtained as a consequence of the confession extracted from him by means of prohibited measures. 41.On 14 December 2004 the Federal Constitutional Court, sitting as a panel of three judges, held that the applicant’s constitutional complaint was inadmissible. 42.Firstly, in so far as the applicant complained of the failure of the criminal courts to discontinue the proceedings against him, the court found that he had not sufficiently substantiated his complaint. It observed that the Regional Court had already stated that the police’s threat to inflict pain on the applicant had violated Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Article 3 of the Convention and that the applicant’s rights under Article1 § 1 and Article 104 § 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law had been disregarded. 43.However, the violation of fundamental rights outside the trial did not necessarily warrant the conclusion that the judgment delivered by a criminal court, which was based on the findings made during the trial, breached constitutional law. In the present case, the criminal courts had found that the methods of investigation used by the police had been prohibited, but had differed from the applicant as to the legal consequences that flowed from that finding. They had taken the view that the statements obtained as a result of the measures in question could not be used but that there was no bar to the specific criminal proceedings being pursued. 44.According to the , the procedural flaw of having used prohibited investigation measures could be regarded as having been remedied by the criminal courts, because they had prohibited the admission of the statements obtained thereby. Such a prohibition was prescribed by Article 136a § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in order to compensate for a prior infringement of the rights of the person concerned. However, the circumstances in which substantial procedural irregularities might entail a bar to criminal proceedings were not laid down in law. In these circumstances, the applicant had failed to explain why the contested methods of investigation had not only required a prohibition on using the statements obtained thereby as evidence, but should also lead to a bar to criminal proceedings against him. 45.Secondly, the Federal Constitutional Court found that, in so far as the applicant complained that the Regional Court had refused to exclude the use in the proceedings of all items of evidence obtained as a result of the confession extracted under duress, his constitutional complaint was likewise inadmissible. It held that the applicant had failed to raise this issue in the proceedings before the Federal Court of Justice. 46.The decision was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 22 December 2004. 47.On 20 December 2004 the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court delivered judgments against the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., and detective officer E. The court found that on the morning of 1 October 2002 D. had ordered that the applicant was to be questioned while being subjected to pain in the manner set out in his subsequent note for the police file (see paragraph 20 above). By doing so, he had acted against the advice of all his subordinate heads of department entrusted with the investigation into J.’s kidnapping. The heads of department had opposed this measure, which D. had previously ordered on the evening of 30 September 2002 and then twice on the morning of 1 October 2002. The heads of department had resisted the orders, proposing instead further questioning and confrontation of the applicant with J.’s family. D. had then issued an order to detective officer E. directing him to comply with his instructions that the applicant should be threatened with torture and, if necessary, subjected thereto. The subjection to pain was to be carried out under medical supervision, without any traces being left, by another specially trained police officer, who would be brought to the police station by helicopter. A police doctor had agreed to supervise the execution of D.’s order. The court noted that the measure had been aimed at finding out where the applicant had hidden J., whose life D. believed was at great risk. Therefore, E. had threatened the applicant in the manner ordered by D. and had also informed him that a “truth serum” would be administered. After approximately ten minutes, the applicant confessed that he had hidden J.’s body under a jetty at a pond near Birstein. 48.The observed that the method of investigation had not been justified. It rejected the defence of “necessity” because the method in question violated human dignity, as codified in Article 1 of the Basic Law. Respect for human dignity also lay at the heart of Article 104 § 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law and Article 3 of the Convention. The protection of human dignity was absolute, allowing of no exceptions or any balancing of interests. 49.The convicted detective officer E. of coercion committed by an official in the course of his duties. However, in terms of penalty, it cautioned the defendant and imposed a suspended fine of 60 euros (EUR) per diem for 60 days, which the defendant would be required to pay if he committed another offence during the probation period. Furthermore, the court convicted the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., of having incited E., a subordinate, to commit coercion in the course of his duties. It also cautioned D. and imposed on him a suspended fine of EUR 120 per diem for 90 days. The applicant had given evidence as a witness in these proceedings. 50.In determining the sentences, the considered that there were significant mitigating factors to be taken into account. It took into consideration that the defendants’ sole concern had been to save J.’s life and that they had been under extreme pressure because of their respective responsibilities vis-à-vis the superior authority and the public. They had been exhausted at the relevant time and had acted in a very tense and hectic situation. They did not have any previous convictions. Moreover, D. had taken responsibility for his acts by admitting and explaining them in a note for the police file on the same day. The proceedings had lasted a long time and had attracted immense media attention. The defendants had suffered prejudice in their professional career: D. had been transferred to the Hessian Ministry of the Interior, and E. had been prohibited from acting in the prosecution of criminal offences. Furthermore, it was the first time that a conflict situation such as the one in the defendants’ case had been assessed by a German criminal court. The court took into consideration as aggravating factors that D. had not acted spontaneously as he had already directed the use of force on the evening before he had given the order to E. Moreover, by their acts, the defendants had risked compromising the applicant’s conviction for murder. The court further found that the preservation of the legal order did not warrant the enforcement of the fines imposed. Through the defendants’ criminal conviction it had been made clear that an order by a State agent to use force to obtain information was illegal. 51.The judgment became final on 20 December 2004. 52.Subsequently, D. was appointed chief of the Police Headquarters for Technology, Logistics and Administration. 53.On 28 December 2005 the applicant applied to the for legal aid for bringing official liability proceedings against the for the payment of compensation. He claimed that he had been traumatised and in need of psychological treatment because of the methods deployed during the police investigation. 54.In its submissions dated 27 March 2006 the Frankfurt am Main police headquarters contested that E.’s conduct when questioning the applicant in the morning of 1 October 2002 was to be legally classified as coercion and amounted to a breach of official duties. 55.On 28 August 2006 the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s application for legal aid and the applicant appealed. 56.On 28 February 2007 the Frankfurt am Main Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. Endorsing the reasons given by the Regional Court, it confirmed, in particular, that police officers D. and E., when threatening the applicant, had infringed human dignity, which was inviolable, and had thus breached their official duties. However, the applicant would face difficulties establishing causation between the threats of torture and alleged mental damage allegedly necessitating psychological treatment. The officers’ threat was negligible compared to the traumatisation caused by the fact of having killed a child. Moreover, even assuming that the applicant would be able to prove that detective officer E. had shaken him, causing him to hit his head against a wall, or had once hit him on the chest, allegedly causing a haematoma, such physical damage would be too minor to necessitate the payment of compensation. Furthermore, the violation of his human dignity by the threat of torture did not warrant the payment of compensation since the applicant had obtained sufficient satisfaction for this by the exclusion of his statements as evidence and the criminal conviction of the police officers. 57.On 19 January 2008 the Federal Constitutional Court, allowing a constitutional complaint by the applicant, quashed the Court of Appeal’s decision and remitted the case to that court. It found that in refusing to grant the applicant legal aid, the Court of Appeal had violated the principle of equal access to court. In particular, that court had speculated that the applicant would not be able to prove that the threat to torture him had led to mental damage. In addition to that, it was not obvious that the physical injuries the applicant claimed to have suffered in the course of the interrogation, during which he had been handcuffed, could be considered to be of minor importance. Moreover, the question whether the violation of the applicant’s human dignity necessitated the payment of damages despite the satisfaction he had already obtained was a difficult legal question on which no precedent existed in a judgment of a court of final instance. It should, therefore, not be determined in an application for legal-aid proceedings. 58.The remitted proceedings are still pending before the . 59.Article 1 § 1 of the Basic Law, on the protection of human dignity, reads as follows: “Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all State authorities.” 60.Article 104 § 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law, on the rights of persons in detention, provides: “Persons taken into custody may not be subjected to mental or to physical ill-treatment.” 61.Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, on prohibited methods of interrogation (verbotene Vernehmungsmethoden), provides: “1.The freedom of the accused to make decisions and to manifest his will shall not be impaired by ill-treatment, induced fatigue, physical interference, the administration of drugs, torment, deception or hypnosis. Coercion may be used only in so far as it is permitted by the law on criminal procedure. Threatening the accused with measures that are not permitted under the law on criminal procedure or holding out the prospect of an advantage that is not contemplated by statute shall be prohibited.>Measures which impair the accused’s memory or ability to understand and accept a given situation [Einsichtsfähigkeit] shall not be permitted.>The prohibition under sub-paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply even if the accused has consented [to the proposed measure]. Statements obtained in breach of this prohibition shall not be used [in evidence], even if the accused has agreed to their use.” 62.According to Article 211 of the Criminal Code, the intentional killing of a person is to be classified as murder if certain aggravating elements are present such as cupidity, treachery or intent to cover up another offence. Murder is punishable by life imprisonment. 63.A declaration by the sentencing court that the defendant’s guilt is of a particular gravity may, inter alia, have a bearing on a subsequent decision regarding suspension of the latter part of the defendant’s prison sentence on probation. Article 57a of the Criminal Code states that the court is to suspend the remainder of a life sentence on probation if the convicted person has served fifteen years of his sentence, provided that this can be justified in the interests of public security and the particular gravity of the defendant’s guilt does not warrant the continued execution of the sentence. 64.The United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the United Nations Convention against Torture”), which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1984 (Resolution 39/46) and which came into force on 26 June 1987, provides: Article 1 “1.For the purposes of this Convention, the term ‘torture’ means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions. ...” Article 15 “Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.” Article 16 “1.Each State Party shall undertake to prevent in any territory under its jurisdiction other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture as defined in Article 1, when such acts are committed by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. In particular, the obligations contained in Articles 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall apply with the substitution for references to torture of references to other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. ...” 65.Several institutions which monitor observance of the prohibition of torture and of other inhuman or degrading treatment have addressed the question of the scope of that prohibition in the context of threats of subjecting a person to physical harm. 66.The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in its judgment of 27November 2003 (Merits, Reparations and Costs) in the case of Maritza Urrutia v. Guatemala (Series C No. 103), found: “85.With regard to the treatment that the State officials afforded to Maritza Urrutia while she was unlawfully and arbitrarily detained, the court has considered proven that the alleged victim’s head was covered by a hood, she was kept handcuffed to a bed, in a room with the light on and the radio at full volume, which prevented her from sleeping. In addition, she was subjected to very prolonged interrogations, during which she was shown photographs of individuals who showed signs of torture or had been killed in combat and she was threatened that she would be found by her family in the same way. The State agents also threatened to torture her physically or to kill her or members of her family if she did not collaborate. To this end, they showed her photographs of herself and her family and correspondence from her to her former husband ... Lastly, Maritza Urrutia was obliged to film a video, which was subsequently broadcast by two Guatemalan television channels, in which she made a statement against her will, the contents of which she was forced to ratify at a press conference held after her release ... 92.An international juridical regime of absolute prohibition of all forms of torture, both physical and psychological, has been developed and, with regard to the latter, it has been recognised that the threat or real danger of subjecting a person to physical harm produces, under determined circumstances, such a degree of moral anguish that it may be considered ‘psychological torture’. ... ... 98.In light of the foregoing, the court declares that the State violated Article 5 of the American Convention [on Human Rights], in relation to Article 1 § 1 thereof, and the obligations established in Articles 1 and 6 of the Inter-American Convention against Torture, to the detriment of Maritza Urrutia.” 67.The United Nations Special Rapporteur for the Commission on Human Rights found in his report of 3 July 2001 to the General Assembly on the question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (UN Doc. A/56/156) as follows: “As stated by the Human Rights Committee in its General Comment No. 20 (10April 1992), on Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Special Rapporteur would like to remind governments that the prohibition of torture relates not only to acts that cause physical pain but also to acts that cause mental suffering to the victim, such as intimidation and other forms of threats.” (paragraph 3) He pointed out that “the fear of physical torture may itself constitute mental torture” (paragraph 7). Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur was of the opinion that: “... serious and credible threats, including death threats, to the physical integrity of the victim or a third person can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or even to torture, especially when the victim remains in the hands of law enforcement officials.” (paragraph 8) 68.The United Nations Human Rights Committee, in its Views adopted on 29 March 1983 in the case of Estrella v. Uruguay (Communication No.74/1980), found as follows regarding the author of the communication, a concert pianist: “The author was subjected to severe physical and psychological torture, including the threat that the author’s hands would be cut off by an electric saw, in an effort to force him to admit subversive activities.” (paragraph 8.3) The Human Rights Committee held that the author had been subjected to torture in violation of Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (paragraph 10).>The admission of evidence procured as a result of torture or other prohibited ill-treatment: the exclusionary rule 69.Materials before the Court show that there is no clear consensus in the States Parties to the Convention on the scope of the exclusionary rule. 70.The United Nations Human Rights Committee stated in its General Comment No. 7 on torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 7 of the ICCPR) of 30 May 1982: “1.... it follows from Article 7, read together with Article 2 of the Covenant, that States must ensure an effective protection through some machinery of control. Complaints about ill-treatment must be investigated effectively by competent authorities. Those found guilty must be held responsible, and the alleged victims must themselves have effective remedies at their disposal, including the right to obtain compensation. Among the safeguards which may make control effective are ... provisions making confessions or other evidence obtained through torture or other treatment contrary to Article 7 inadmissible in court; ...” 71.General Comment No. 7 was replaced by General Comment No. 20 concerning prohibition of torture and cruel treatment or punishment of 10March 1992. In the latter, it is stated: “12.It is important for the discouragement of violations under Article 7 that the law must prohibit the use of admissibility in judicial proceedings of statements or confessions obtained through torture or other prohibited treatment.” 72.The United Nations Committee against Torture, which monitors the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Torture, stated in its Concluding Observations on Germany of 11 May 1998 (UN Doc. A/53/44) as follows: “The Committee recommends that further legislative attention be paid to the strict enforcement of Article 15 of the Convention and that all evidence obtained directly or indirectly by torture be strictly prevented from reaching the cognisance of the deciding judges in all judicial proceedings.” (paragraph 193) 73.The prohibition on using, in any manner prejudicial to the accused, information derived from facts learned as a result of the unlawful acts of State agents (the so-called doctrine of the “fruit of the poisonous tree”) is firmly rooted in the legal tradition of the United States of America (see, for instance, US Supreme Court, no. 82-1651, Nix v. Williams, decision of 11June 1984, 467 US 431 (1984), pp. 441 et seq.; US Supreme Court, no.82-5298, Segura v. United States, decision of 5 July 1984, 468 US 796 (1984), pp. 796-97 and 815; and US Supreme Court, no. 07-513, Herring v. United States, decision of 14 January 2009, 555 US ... (2009), part I A., with further references). The prohibition applies to information obtained from coerced confessions (see, on the issue of coercion, US Supreme Court, no. 50, Blackburn v. Alabama, decision of 11 January 1960, 361 US 199 (1960), pp. 205-07, and US Supreme Court, no. 8, Townsend v. Sain, decision of 18 March 1963, 372 US 293 (1963), pp. 293 and 307-09), meaning that if the confession leads to additional evidence, such evidence is also inadmissible in court in addition to the confession itself (compare Nix, cited above, p. 441, and Segura, cited above, p. 804). The evidence is to be excluded, however, only if the illegality is the proximate cause of the discovery of the evidence. In other words, evidence will be excluded if it can be shown that “but for” the illegal conduct it would not have been found. The exclusionary rule does not apply where the connection between the illegal police conduct and the discovery of the evidence is so remote as to dissipate the taint. This is the case, for example, where the police relied on an independent source to find the evidence (see Nix, cited above, pp.441-44, and Segura, cited above, pp. 796-97, 804-05 and 815, with further references) or where the evidence would ultimately or inevitably have been discovered even had no violation of any constitutional provision taken place (see Nix, cited above, pp. 441-44). 74.The exclusionary rule is also applied in other jurisdictions. The Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa found in its recent judgment of 10April 2008 in the case of Mthembu v. The State, case no. 379/2007, [2008] ZASCA 51 as follows: “Summary: The evidence of an accomplice extracted through torture (including real evidence derived from it) is inadmissible ... ... 33.... The Hilux and the metal box were real evidence critical to the State’s case against the appellant on the robbery counts. Ordinarily, as I have mentioned, such evidence would not be excluded because it exists independently of any constitutional violation. But these discoveries were made as [a] result of the police having tortured Ramseroop. There is no suggestion that the discoveries would have been made in any event. If they had the outcome of this case might have been different. 34.Ramseroop made his statement to the police immediately after the metal box was discovered at his home following his torture. That his subsequent testimony was given apparently voluntarily does not detract from the fact that the information contained in that statement pertaining to the Hilux and metal box was extracted through torture. ... therefore, there is an inextricable link between his torture and the nature of the evidence that was tendered in court. The torture has stained the evidence irredeemably. ... 36.To admit Ramseroop’s testimony regarding the Hilux and metal box would require us to shut our eyes to the manner in which the police obtained this information from him. More seriously, it is tantamount to involving the judicial process in ‘moral defilement’. This ‘would compromise the integrity of the judicial process (and) dishonour the administration of justice’. In the long term, the admission of torture-induced evidence can only have a corrosive effect on the criminal justice system. The public interest, in my view, demands its exclusion, irrespective of whether such evidence has an impact on the fairness of the trial. 37.For all these reasons I consider Ramseroop’s evidence relating to the Hilux and metal box to be inadmissible. ...”",2010,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

120,001-59454,Grand Chamber,"13.The complaints raised in this application arise out of the Turkish military operations in northern Cyprus in July and August 1974 and the continuing division of the . At the time of the Court's consideration of the merits of the Loizidou v. case in 1996, the Turkish military presence at the material time was described in the following terms (Loizidou v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996 (merits), Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, p. 2223, §§ 16-17): “16.Turkish armed forces of more than 30,000 personnel are stationed throughout the whole of the occupied area of northern , which is constantly patrolled and has checkpoints on all main lines of communication. The army's headquarters are in Kyrenia. The 28th Infantry Division is based in Asha (Assia) with its sector covering Famagusta to the Mia Milia suburb of and with about 14,500 personnel. The 39th Infantry Division, with about 15,500 personnel, is based at Myrtou village, and its sector ranges from Yerolakkos village to Lefka. TOURDYK (Turkish Forces in Cyprus under the Treaty of Guarantee) is stationed at Orta Keuy village near Nicosia, with a sector running from Nicosia International Airport to the . A Turkish naval command and outpost are based at and Kyrenia respectively. Turkish airforce personnel are based at Lefkoniko, Krini and other airfields. The Turkish airforce is stationed on the Turkish mainland at . 17.The Turkish forces and all civilians entering military areas are subject to Turkish military courts, as stipulated so far as concerns 'TRNC citizens' by the Prohibited Military Areas Decree of 1979 (section 9) and Article 156 of the Constitution of the 'TRNC'.” 14.A major development in the continuing division of Cyprus occurred in November 1983 with the proclamation of the “Turkish Republic of Northern ” (the “TRNC”) and the subsequent enactment of the “TRNC Constitution” on 7 May 1985. This development was condemned by the international community. On 18 November 1983 the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution541 (1983) declaring the proclamation of the establishment of the “TRNC” legally invalid and calling upon all States not to recognise any Cypriot State other than the Republic of Cyprus. A similar call was made by the Security Council on 11 May 1984 in its Resolution 550 (1984). In November 1983 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe decided that it continued to regard the government of the Republic of Cyprus as the sole legitimate government of Cyprus and called for respect of the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of the . 15.According to the respondent Government, the “TRNC” is a democratic and constitutional State which is politically independent of all other sovereign States including Turkey, and the administration in northern Cyprus has been set up by the Turkish-Cypriot people in the exercise of its right to self-determination and not by . Notwithstanding this view, it is only the Cypriot government which is recognised internationally as the government of the in the context of diplomatic and treaty relations and the working of international organisations. 16.United Nations peacekeeping forces (“UNFICYP”) maintain a buffer-zone. A number of political initiatives have been taken at the level of the United Nations aimed at settling the problem on the basis of institutional arrangements acceptable to both sides. To this end, inter-communal talks have been sponsored by the Secretary-General of the United Nations acting under the direction of the Security Council. In this connection, the respondent Government maintain that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities in northern have pursued the talks on the basis of what they consider to be already agreed principles of bi-zonality and bi-communality within the framework of a federal constitution. Support for this basis of negotiation is found in the UN Secretary-General's Set of Ideas of 15 July 1992 and the UN Security Council resolutions of 26 August 1992 and 25 November 1992 confirming that a federal solution sought by both sides will be “bi-communal” and “bi-zonal”. Furthermore, and of relevance to the instant application, in 1981 the United Nations Committee on Missing Persons (“CMP”) was set up to “look into cases of persons reported missing in the inter-communal fighting as well as in the events of July 1974 and afterwards” and “to draw up comprehensive lists of missing persons of both communities, specifying as appropriate whether they are still alive or dead, and in the latter case approximate times of death”. The CMP has not yet completed its investigations. 17.The events of July and August 1974 and their aftermath gave rise to three previous applications by the applicant Government against the respondent State under former Article 24 of the Convention. The first (no.6780/74) and second (no. 6950/75) applications were joined by the Commission and led to the adoption on 10 July 1976 of a report under former Article 31 of the Convention (“the 1976 report”) in which the Commission expressed the opinion that the respondent State had violated Articles 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. On 20 January 1979 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in turn adopted, with reference to an earlier decision of 21 October 1977, Resolution DH (79) 1 in which it expressed, inter alia, the conviction that “the enduring protection of human rights in Cyprus can only be brought about through the re-establishment of peace and confidence between the two communities; and that inter-communal talks constitute the appropriate framework for reaching a solution of the dispute”. In its resolution the Committee of Ministers strongly urged the parties to resume the talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in order to agree upon solutions on all aspects of the dispute (see paragraph 16 above). The Committee of Ministers viewed this decision as completing its consideration of the case. The third application (no. 8007/77) lodged by the applicant Government was the subject of a further report under former Article 31 adopted by the Commission on 4 October 1983 (“the 1983 report”). In that report the Commission expressed the opinion that the respondent State was in breach of its obligations under Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. On 2 April 1992 the Committee of Ministers adopted Resolution DH (92) 12 in respect of the Commission's 1983 report. In its resolution the Committee of Ministers limited itself to a decision to make the 1983 report public and stated that its consideration of the case was thereby completed. 18.The instant application is the first to have been referred to the Court. The applicant Government requested the Court in their memorial to “decide and declare that the respondent State is responsible for continuing violations and other violations of Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17 and 18 of the Convention and of Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No. 1”. These allegations were invoked with reference to four broad categories of complaints: alleged violations of the rights of Greek-Cypriot missing persons and their relatives; alleged violations of the home and property rights of displaced persons; alleged violations of the rights of enclaved Greek Cypriots in northern Cyprus; alleged violations of the rights of Turkish Cypriots and the Gypsy community in northern Cyprus. 19.The Court considers it appropriate at this stage to summarise the Commission's findings of fact in respect of the various violations of the Convention alleged by the applicant Government as well as the essential arguments advanced by both parties and the documentary and other evidence relied on by the Commission. 20.The applicant Government essentially claimed in their application that about 1,491 Greek Cypriots were still missing twenty years after the cessation of hostilities. These persons were last seen alive in Turkish custody and their fate has never been accounted for by the respondent State. 21.The respondent Government maintained in reply that there was no proof that any of the missing persons were still alive or were being kept in custody. In their principal submission, the issues raised by the applicant Government should continue to be pursued within the framework of the United Nations Committee on Missing Persons (see paragraph 16 above) rather than under the Convention. 22.The Commission proceeded on the understanding that its task was not to establish what actually happened to the Greek-Cypriot persons who went missing following the Turkish military operations conducted in northern in July and August 1974. Rather, it saw its task as one of determining whether or not the alleged failure of the respondent State to clarify the facts surrounding the disappearances constituted a continuing violation of the Convention. 23.To that end, the Commission had particular regard to its earlier findings in its 1976 and 1983 reports. It recalled that in its 1976 report it had stated that it was widely accepted that a considerable number of Cypriots were still missing as a result of armed conflict in Cyprus and that a number of persons declared to be missing were identified as Greek Cypriots taken prisoner by the Turkish army. This finding, in the Commission's opinion at the time, created a presumption of Turkish responsibility for the fate of persons shown to be in Turkish custody. While noting that killings of Greek-Cypriot civilians had occurred on a large scale, the Commission also considered at the time of its 1976 report that it was unable to ascertain whether, and under what circumstances, Greek-Cypriot prisoners declared to be missing had been deprived of their life. 24.In the present case, the Commission further recalled that in its 1983 report it found it established that there were sufficient indications in an indefinite number of cases that missing Greek Cypriots had been in Turkish custody in 1974 and that this finding once again created a presumption of Turkish responsibility for the fate of these persons. 25.The Commission found that the evidence submitted to it in the instant case confirmed its earlier findings that certain of the missing persons were last seen in Turkish or Turkish-Cypriot custody. In this connection, the Commission had regard to the following: a statement of Mr Denktaş, “President of the TRNC”, broadcast on 1 March 1996, in which he admitted that forty-two Greek-Cypriot prisoners were handed over to Turkish-Cypriot fighters who killed them and that in order to prevent further such killings prisoners were subsequently transferred to Turkey; the broadcast statement of Professor Yalçin Küçük, a former Turkish officer who had served in the Turkish army at the time and participated in the 1974 military operation in Cyprus, in which he suggested that the Turkish army had engaged in widespread killings of, inter alia, civilians in so-called cleaning-up operations; the Dillon Report submitted to the United States Congress in May 1998 indicating, inter alia, that Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot soldiers rounded up Greek-Cypriot civilians in the village of Asha on 18 August 1974 and took away males over the age of 15, most of whom were reportedly killed by Turkish-Cypriot fighters; the written statements of witnesses tending to corroborate the Commission's earlier findings that many persons now missing were taken into custody by Turkish soldiers or Turkish-Cypriot paramilitaries. 26.The Commission concluded that, notwithstanding evidence of the killing of Greek-Cypriot prisoners and civilians, there was no proof that any of the missing persons were killed in circumstances for which the respondent State could be held responsible; nor did the Commission find any evidence to the effect that any of the persons taken into custody were still being detained or kept in servitude by the respondent State. On the other hand, the Commission found it established that the facts surrounding the fate of the missing persons had not been clarified by the authorities and brought to the notice of the victims' relatives. 27.The Commission further concluded that its examination of the applicant Government's complaints in the instant application was not precluded by the ongoing work of the CMP. It noted in this connection that the scope of the investigation being conducted by the CMP was limited to determining whether or not any of the missing persons on its list were dead or alive; nor was the CMP empowered to make findings either on the cause of death or on the issue of responsibility for any deaths so established. Furthermore, the territorial jurisdiction of the CMP was limited to the island of Cyprus, thus excluding investigations in where some of the disappearances were claimed to have occurred. The Commission also observed that persons who might be responsible for violations of the Convention were promised impunity and that it was doubtful whether the CMP's investigation could extend to actions by the Turkish army or Turkish officials on Cypriot territory. 28.The Commission established the facts under this heading against the background of the applicant Government's principal submission that over 211,000 displaced Greek Cypriots and their children continued to be prevented as a matter of policy from returning to their homes in northern and from having access to their property there for any purpose. The applicant Government submitted that the presence of the Turkish army together with “TRNC”-imposed border restrictions ensured that the return of displaced persons was rendered physically impossible and, as a corollary, that their cross-border family visits were gravely impeded. What started as a gradual and continuing process of illegality over the years had now resulted in the transfer of the property left behind by the displaced persons to the “TRNC” authorities without payment of compensation and its re-assignment, together with “title deeds”, to State bodies, Turkish Cypriots and settlers from . 29.The respondent Government maintained before the Commission that the question of the Varosha district of Famagusta along with the issues of freedom of movement, freedom of settlement and the right of property could only be resolved within the framework of the inter-communal talks (see paragraph 16 above) and on the basis of the principles agreed on by both sides for the conduct of the talks. Until an overall solution to the question, acceptable to both sides, was found, and having regard to security considerations, there could be no question of a right of the displaced persons to return. The respondent Government further submitted that the regulation of property abandoned by displaced persons, as with restrictions on cross-border movement, fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the “TRNC” authorities. 30.The Commission found that it was common knowledge that with the exception of a few hundred Maronites living in the Kormakiti area and Greek Cypriots living in the Karpas peninsula, the whole Greek-Cypriot population which before 1974 resided in the northern part of Cyprus had left that area, the large majority of these people now living in southern . The reality of this situation was not contested by the respondent Government. 31.The Commission noted with reference to its earlier findings in its 1976 and 1983 reports that there was no essential change in the situation obtaining at the time of the introduction of the instant application. Accordingly, and this was not disputed either by the respondent Government, displaced Greek Cypriots had no possibility of returning to their homes in northern Cyprus and were physically prevented from crossing into the northern part on account of the fact that it was sealed off by the Turkish army. The arrangements introduced by the “TRNC” authorities in 1998 to allow Greek Cypriots and Maronites to cross into northern for the purposes of family visits or, as regards Greek Cypriots, visits to the Apostolos Andreas Monastery, did not affect this conclusion. 32.Nor did the respondent Government dispute the fact that Greek-Cypriot owners of property in northern continued to be prevented from having access to, controlling, using and enjoying their property. As to the fate of that property, the Commission found it established that up until 1989 there was an administrative practice of the Turkish-Cypriot authorities to leave the official Land Register unaffected and to register separately the “abandoned” property and its allocation. The beneficiaries of allocations were issued with “possessory certificates” but not “deeds of title” to the properties concerned. However, as from June 1989 the practice changed and thereafter “title deeds” were issued and the relevant entries concerning the change of ownership were made in the Land Register. The Commission found it established that, at least since June 1989, the Turkish-Cypriot authorities no longer recognised any ownership rights of Greek Cypriots in respect of their properties in northern . The Commission found confirmation for this finding in the provisions of “Article 159 § 1 (b) of the TRNC Constitution” of 7 May 1985 and “Law no. 52/1995” purporting to give effect to that provision. 33.Although the respondent Government pointed out in their submissions to the Commission that the issue of the right of displaced Greek Cypriots to return to their homes was a matter to be determined within the framework of the inter-communal talks sponsored by the Secretary-General of the United Nations (see paragraph 16 above), the Commission found that there had been no significant progress in recent years in the discussion of issues such as freedom of settlement, payment of compensation to Greek Cypriots for the interference with their property rights, or restitution of Greek-Cypriot property in the Varosha district. 34.The applicant Government adduced evidence in support of their complaint that the dwindling number of Greek Cypriots living in the Karpas peninsula of northern Cyprus were subjected to continuing oppressive treatment which amounted to a complete denial of their rights and a negation of their human dignity. In addition to the harassment and intimidation which they suffered at the hands of Turkish settlers, and which has gone unpunished, the enclaved Greek Cypriots laboured under restrictions which violated many of the substantive rights contained in the Convention. The continuous daily interferences with their rights could not be redressed at the local level on account of the absence of effective remedies before the “TRNC” courts. Similar but less extensive restrictions applied to the Maronite population living in the Kormakiti area of northern . 35.The respondent Government maintained before the Commission that effective judicial remedies were available to all Greek Cypriots living in northern . However, they claimed that the applicant Government actively discouraged them from taking proceedings in the “TRNC”. The respondent Government further submitted that the evidence before the Commission did not provide any basis of fact for the allegations made. 36.The Commission established the facts under this heading with reference to materials submitted by both Governments. These materials included, inter alia, written statements of persons affected by the restrictions alleged by the applicant Government; press reports dealing with the situation in northern Cyprus; case-law of the “TRNC” courts on the availability of remedies in the “TRNC”; “TRNC legislation” and decisions of the “TRNC Council of Ministers” on entry and exit arrangements at the check-point. The Commission also had regard to United Nations documents concerning the living conditions of enclaved Greek Cypriots and especially to the UN Secretary-General's progress reports of 10 December 1995 and 9 March 1998 on the humanitarian review carried out by UNFICYP in 1994-95 concerning the living conditions of Karpas Greek Cypriots, the so-called “Karpas Brief”. 37.Furthermore, the Commission's delegates heard the evidence of fourteen witnesses on the situation of Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in northern . These witnesses comprised two persons who were closely associated with the preparation of the “Karpas Brief” as well as persons proposed by both Governments. The delegates also visited, on 23 and 24 February 1998, a number of localities in northern , including Greek-Cypriot villages in the Karpas area, and heard statements from officials and other persons encountered during the visits. 38.The Commission considered the above-mentioned “Karpas Brief” an accurate description of the situation of the enclaved Greek-Cypriot and Maronite populations at about the time of the introduction of the instant application and that the proposals for remedial action recommended by UNFICYP following the humanitarian review reflected the real needs of these groups in the face of administrative practices which actually existed at the material time. Although the Commission noted that there had been a considerable improvement in the overall situation of the enclaved populations, as evidenced by the UN Secretary-General's progress reports on the “Karpas Brief” recommendations, there still remained a number of severe restrictions. These restrictions were not laid down in any “TRNC legislation” and were in the nature of administrative practices. 39.The Commission further found that there existed a functioning court system in the “TRNC” which was in principle accessible to Greek Cypriots living in northern . It appeared that at least in cases of trespass to property or personal injury there had been some successful actions brought by Greek-Cypriot litigants before the civil and criminal courts. However, in view of the scarcity of cases brought by Greek Cypriots, the Commission was led to conclude that the effectiveness of the judicial system for resident Greek Cypriots had not really been tested. 40.In a further conclusion, the Commission found that there was no evidence of continuing wrongful allocation of properties of resident Greek Cypriots to other persons during the period under consideration. However, the Commission did find it established that there was a continuing practice of the “TRNC” authorities to allocate to Turkish-Cypriots or immigrants the property of Greek Cypriots who had died or left northern . 41.In the absence of legal proceedings before the “TRNC” courts, the Commission noted that it had not been tested whether or not Greek Cypriots or Maronites living in northern were in fact considered as citizens enjoying the protection of the “TRNC Constitution”. It did however find it established that, in so far as the groups at issue complained of administrative practices such as restrictions on their freedom of movement or on family visits which were based on decisions of the “TRNC Council of Ministers”, any legal challenge to these restrictions would be futile given that such decisions were not open to review by the courts. 42.Although the Commission found no evidence of cases of actual detention of members of the enclaved population, it was satisfied that there was clear evidence that restrictions on movement and family visits continued to be applied to Greek Cypriots and Maronites notwithstanding recent improvements. It further observed that an exit visa was still necessary for transfers to medical facilities in the south, although no fees were levied in urgent cases. There was no evidence to confirm the allegation that the processing of applications for movement was delayed in certain cases with the result that the health or life of patients was endangered; nor was there any indication of a deliberate practice of delaying the processing of such applications. 43.The Commission found it established that there were restrictions on the freedom of movement of Greek-Cypriot and Maronite schoolchildren attending schools in the south. Until the entry into force of the decision of the “TRNC Council of Ministers” of 11 February 1998, they were not allowed to return permanently to the north after having attained the age of 16 in the case of males and 18 in the case of females. The age-limit of 16years was still maintained for Greek-Cypriot male students. Up to the age-limit, certain restrictions applied to the visits of students to their parents in the north, which were gradually relaxed. However, even today such visits are subject to a visa requirement and a reduced “entry fee”. 44.As to educational facilities, the Commission held that, although there was a system of primary-school education for the children of Greek Cypriots living in northern , there were no secondary schools for them. The vast majority of schoolchildren went to the south for their secondary education and the restriction on the return of Greek-Cypriot and Maronite schoolchildren to the north after the completion of their studies had led to the separation of many families. Furthermore, school textbooks for use in the Greek-Cypriot primary school were subjected to a “vetting” procedure in the context of confidence-building measures suggested by UNFICYP. The procedure was cumbersome and a relatively high number of school-books were being objected to by the Turkish-Cypriot administration. 45.Aside from school-books, the Commission found no evidence of any restrictions being applied during the period under consideration to the importation, circulation or possession of other types of books; nor was there evidence of restrictions on the circulation of newspapers published in southern . However, there was no regular distribution system for the Greek-Cypriot press in the Karpas area and no direct post and telecommunications links between the north and south of the island. It was further noted that the enclaved population was able to receive Greek-Cypriot radio and television. 46.The Commission did not find any conclusive evidence that letters destined for Greek Cypriots were opened by the “TRNC” police or that their telephones were tapped. 47.As to alleged restrictions on religious worship, the Commission found that the main problem for Greek Cypriots in this connection stemmed from the fact that there was only one priest for the whole Karpas area and that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities were not favourable to the appointment of additional priests from the south. The Commission delegates were unable to confirm during their visit to the Karpas area whether access to the Apostolos Andreas Monastery was free at any time for Karpas Greek Cypriots. It appeared to be the case that on high religious holidays (which occur three times a year) visits to the monastery are also allowed to Greek Cypriots from the south. 48.Concerning alleged restrictions on the freedom of association of the enclaved population, the Commission observed that the relevant “TRNC” law on associations only covered the creation of associations by Turkish Cypriots. 49.The applicant Government contended before the Commission that Turkish Cypriots living in northern , especially political dissidents and the Gypsy community, were the victims of an administrative practice of violation of their Convention rights. They adduced evidence in support of their claim that these groups were victims of arbitrary arrest and detention, police misconduct, discrimination and ill-treatment and interferences in various forms with other Convention rights such as, inter alia, fair trial, private and family life, expression, association, property and education. 50.The respondent Government essentially maintained that the above allegations were unsubstantiated on the evidence and pointed to the availability of effective remedies in the “TRNC” to aggrieved persons. 51.The Commission's investigation into the applicant Government's allegations was based mainly on the oral evidence of thirteen witnesses who testified before the Commission's delegates on the situation of Turkish Cypriots and the Gypsy community living in northern . The witnesses were proposed by both parties. Their evidence was taken by the delegates in Strasbourg, Cyprus and between November 1997 and April 1998. 52.The Commission found that there existed rivalry and social conflict between the original Turkish Cypriots and immigrants from who continued to arrive in considerable numbers. Some of the original Turkish Cypriots and their political groups and media resented the “TRNC” policy of full integration for the settlers. 53.Furthermore, while there was a significant incidence of emigration from the “TRNC” for economic reasons, it could not be excluded that there were also cases of Turkish Cypriots having fled the “TRNC” out of fear of political persecution. The Commission considered that there was no reason to doubt the correctness of witnesses' assertions that in a few cases complaints of harassment or discrimination by private groups of or against political opponents were not followed up by the “TRNC” police. However, it concluded that it was not established beyond reasonable doubt that there was in fact a consistent administrative practice of the “TRNC” authorities, including the courts, of refusing protection to political opponents of the ruling parties. In so far as it was alleged by the applicant Government that the authorities themselves were involved in the harassment of political opponents, the Commission did not have sufficient details concerning the incidents complained of (for example, the dispersing of demonstrations, short-term arrests) which would allow it to form an opinion as to the justification or otherwise of the impugned acts. The Commission noted that, in any event, it did not appear that the remedy of habeas corpus had been invoked by persons claiming to be victims of arbitrary arrest or detention. 54.Regarding the alleged discrimination against and arbitrary treatment of members of the Turkish-Cypriot Gypsy community, the Commission found that judicial remedies had apparently not been used in respect of particularly grave incidents such as the pulling down of shacks near Morphou and the refusal of airline companies to transport Gypsies to the United Kingdom without a visa. 55.In a further conclusion, the Commission observed that there was no evidence before it of Turkish-Cypriot civilians having been subjected to the jurisdiction of military courts during the period under consideration. Furthermore, and with respect to the evidence before it, the Commission considered that it had not been established that, during the period under consideration, there was an official prohibition on the circulation of Greek-language newspapers in northern or that the creation of bi-communal associations was prevented. In respect of the alleged refusal of the “TRNC” authorities to allow Turkish Cypriots to return to their properties in southern , the Commission observed that no concrete instances were referred to it of any persons who had wished to do so during the period under consideration.",2001,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT REJECTS THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT'S CRITICISM IN THIS RESPECT.
112.  THE COURT ALSO OBSERVES THAT IN ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE IN RELATION TO THE VARIOUS COMPLAINTS DECLARED ADMISSIBLE, THE COMMISSION APPLIED THE STANDARD OF PROOF “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” AS ENUNCIATED BY THE COURT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT OF 18 JANUARY 1978 (SERIES A NO. 25), IT BEING NOTED THAT SUCH PROOF MAY FOLLOW FROM THE COEXISTENCE OF SUFFICIENTLY STRONG, CLEAR AND CONCORDANT INFERENCES OR OF SIMILAR UNREBUTTED PRESUMPTIONS OF FACT (IBID., PP. 64-65, § 161).
113.  THE COURT, FOR ITS PART, ENDORSES THE APPLICATION OF THIS STANDARD, ALL THE MORE SO SINCE IT WAS FIRST ARTICULATED IN THE CONTEXT OF A PREVIOUS INTERSTATE CASE AND HAS, SINCE THE DATE OF THE ADOPTION OF THE JUDGMENT IN THAT CASE, BECOME PART OF THE COURT'S ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW (FOR A RECENT EXAMPLE, SEE SALMAN V. TURKEY [GC], NO. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000-VII).
MOREOVER, AS REGARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE EXISTENCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES, THE COURT DOES NOT RELY ON THE CONCEPT THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS BORNE BY ONE OR THE OTHER OF THE TWO GOVERNMENTS CONCERNED. RATHER, IT MUST EXAMINE ALL THE MATERIAL BEFORE IT, IRRESPECTIVE OF ITS ORIGIN (SEE THE ABOVE-MENTIONED IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, P. 64 § 160).
114.  THE COURT NOTES, HOWEVER, THAT THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT HAVE DISPUTED THE APPROPRIATENESS OF APPLYING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED STANDARD OF PROOF WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ALLEGATIONS THAT THE VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION OF WHICH THEY COMPLAIN RESULT FROM ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES ON THE PART OF THE RESPONDENT STATE. IN THEIR SUBMISSION, THE COMMISSION ERRED IN NOT HAVING REGARD TO THE EXISTENCE OF “SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE” OF ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES AND ITS RELIANCE ON THE “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” STANDARD PREVENTED IT FROM REACHING THE CORRECT CONCLUSION ON THE FACTS AS REGARDS A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS. FOR THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT, THE STANDARD OF PROOF APPLIED BY THE COMMISSION IS AT VARIANCE WITH THE APPROACH FOLLOWED BY THE COURT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, AN APPROACH WHICH, THEY MAINTAIN, HAD ALREADY BEEN ANTICIPATED IN THE COMMISSION'S DECISION IN THE “GREEK CASE” (YEARBOOK 12).
115.  THE COURT RECALLS HOWEVER THAT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, IT REJECTED THE IRISH GOVERNMENT'S SUBMISSION THAT THE “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” STANDARD OF PROOF WAS AN EXCESSIVELY RIGID STANDARD FOR ESTABLISHING THE EXISTENCE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE OF VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION (LOC. CIT., PP. 64-65, § 161). THE “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” STANDARD WAS APPLIED IN THAT CASE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EVIDENCE BORE OUT THE ALLEGATION OF A PRACTICE OF VIOLATION. THE COURT WILL ACCORDINGLY ASSESS THE FACTS AS FOUND BY THE COMMISSION WITH REFERENCE TO THIS STANDARD. FURTHERMORE, THE COURT WILL APPLY THE DEFINITION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CONVENTION SET OUT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, NAMELY AN ACCUMULATION OF IDENTICAL OR ANALOGOUS BREACHES WHICH ARE SUFFICIENTLY NUMEROUS AND INTER-CONNECTED TO AMOUNT NOT MERELY TO ISOLATED INCIDENTS OR EXCEPTIONS BUT TO A PATTERN OR SYSTEM (IBID., P. 64, § 159).
116.  THE COURT FURTHER RECALLS THAT, IN THE AREA OF THE EXHAUSTION OF DOMESTIC REMEDIES, THERE IS A DISTRIBUTION OF THE BURDEN OF PROOF. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INSTANT CASE, IT IS INCUMBENT ON THE RESPONDENT GOVERNMENT CLAIMING NON-EXHAUSTION TO SATISFY THE COURT THAT THE REMEDY WAS AN EFFECTIVE ONE AVAILABLE IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE AT THE RELEVANT TIME, THAT IS TO SAY, THAT IT WAS ACCESSIBLE, WAS ONE WHICH WAS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING REDRESS IN RESPECT OF THE AGGRIEVED INDIVIDUALS' COMPLAINTS AND OFFERED REASONABLE PROSPECTS OF SUCCESS. HOWEVER, ONCE THIS BURDEN OF PROOF HAS BEEN SATISFIED IT FALLS TO THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH THAT THE REMEDY ADVANCED BY THE RESPONDENT GOVERNMENT WAS IN FACT EXHAUSTED OR WAS FOR SOME REASON INADEQUATE AND INEFFECTIVE IN THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE, OR THAT THERE EXISTED SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ABSOLVING THE PERSONS CONCERNED FROM THE REQUIREMENT OF EXHAUSTING THAT REMEDY. ONE SUCH REASON MAY BE CONSTITUTED BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES REMAINING TOTALLY PASSIVE IN THE FACE OF SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT OR INFLICTION OF HARM BY STATE AGENTS, FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THEY HAVE FAILED TO UNDERTAKE INVESTIGATIONS OR OFFER ASSISTANCE. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IT CAN BE SAID THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF SHIFTS ONCE AGAIN, SO THAT IT BECOMES INCUMBENT ON THE RESPONDENT GOVERNMENT TO SHOW WHAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE "
39,001-145817,Grand Chamber,"7.The applicants were born in 1968 and 1970 respectively. The first applicant, MrSvinarenko, is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in the Murmansk region. The second applicant, MrSlyadnev, lives in the settlement of Sinegorye in the Yagodninskiy district of the Magadan region.>In 2002 the Far Eastern Federal Circuit Investigation Department of the Investigation Committee at the Ministry of the Interior brought several sets of criminal proceedings against a MrGrishin.>On 24 September 2002 the first applicant was questioned as one of the suspects in those proceedings. On 9 October 2002 he was arrested. In a decision of 12 November 2002 ordering his detention on remand, the Magadan Town Court noted that the crimes he was charged with had been committed during a three-year probation period under a judgment of the Magadan Region Yagodninskiy District Court of 13 April 2001 convicting him of theft and imposing on him a conditional sentence of five years’ imprisonment. It also noted that he had negative references from his place of residence and that he had breached his undertaking to appear before the investigating authority. According to the final charges against the first applicant, he was accused of robbery with violence against MrA.S. and MrsT.S. in September 2002 as a member of a gang led by MrGrishin, and of the illegal acquisition, storage, transportation and carrying of ammunition. 10.On 20 January 2003 the second applicant, who was serving a sentence of imprisonment after his conviction by the Magadan Region Yagodninskiy District Court on 26 July 2002 for negligent infliction of death under Article109 §1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (“the CC”), was questioned as one of the suspects in the proceedings brought against MrGrishin. On 22 January 2003 he was charged with the following crimes: (i)establishing an armed gang under MrGrishin’s leadership and participating in the gang’s attacks on citizens from October 2001 toSeptember 2002 – under Article209 § 1 of the CC; (ii)the robbery in October 2001 of MrV.B., the director of a private goldrefining company, with the use of weapons and violence endangering life and health and a threat to use such violence, by an organised group, with the aim of misappropriating another’s property of substantial value – under Article162 § 3 of the CC; (iii)illegal storage and transportation of precious metals (industrial gold allegedly misappropriated from MrV.B.) of substantial value by an organised group in October2001 – under Article 191 § 2 of the CC; (iv)extortion (against MrV.B.) in October 2001 with the aim of obtaining a right to property under the threat of the use of violence, by an organised group – under Article 163 § 3 of the CC; (v)the robbery of MrYa.B. in October 2001 with the use of weapons and violence endangering life and health and the threat to use such violence, by a group of persons according to a premeditated plan, by means of illegal entry into a dwelling with the aim of misappropriating another’s property of substantial value – under Article 162 § 3 of the CC; and (vi)illegal acquisition, storage, transfer, transportation and carrying of firearms by an organised group in October 2001 – under Article222 §3 of the CC. 11.On 11 April 2003 the Magadan Region Khasynskiy District Court found the second applicant to be eligible, in view of his orderly behaviour and positive references, for early conditional release one year and three months ahead of the term of two years and three months to which he had been sentenced under the Yagodninskiy District Court’s judgment of 26July 2002. 12.On 24 April 2003 the Magadan Town Court ordered the second applicant’s remand in custody in the criminal proceedings at issue in the present case. It noted, inter alia, that he was accused of grave crimes which had been committed during a three-year probation period under the Yagodninskiy District Court’s judgment of 15 June 2001 convicting him of hooliganism and wilful infliction of grievous bodily harm and sentencing him conditionally to four years’ imprisonment. 13.On 20 May 2003 the investigation was completed and the defence received access to the case file. 14.On 13August 2003 the Magadan Town Court found that the second applicant had been deliberately delaying the examination of the case file and set a time-limit for the examination at 5 September 2003. 15.On 19 September 2003 the case was sent for trial to the Magadan Regional Court, which held from 16October to 26 December 2003 a preliminary hearing to decide on numerous requests by the applicants and their two co-defendants concerning the admissibility of the evidence and other procedural issues, as well as to prepare the jury trial requested by the defendants. During this period the hearing was postponed for about four weeks at the co-defendants’ request. 16.As a result of the preliminary hearing, on 26 December 2003 the Regional Court ordered that the case be examined at an open hearing by a jury on 23 January 2004. On that day fewer than twenty candidate jurors appeared before the court instead of the fifty invited and the court, therefore, ordered that another 100 candidate jurors be summoned. 17.On 13 February 2004 a jury was empanelled and sworn in. 18.The Regional Court held about thirty court sessions, during which it decided various procedural issues, such as the replacement of some jurors, the exclusion or examination of certain evidence and the ordering of expert opinions. It examined the evidence, including the testimony of the victims, witnesses and experts, and heard the defendants. The hearing was adjourned for two weeks as one of the defence lawyers could not attend. 19.On 15 June 2004 the prosecution amended one of the robbery charges against the second applicant (concerning MrYa.B.) to the lesser charge of “arbitrary unlawful acts” (самоуправство) with the use of violence, under Article330 § 2 of the CC. 20.On 22 June 2004 the jury found the applicants not guilty. They were released in the courtroom. On 29 June 2004 the Magadan Regional Court delivered a judgment in which they were acquitted and their right to rehabilitation was acknowledged. 21.The co-defendants and the prosecution appealed against the trial court’s judgment. On 7 December 2004 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation examined the case on appeal and quashed the judgment on the grounds, inter alia, that some of the jurors had concealed information about their family members’ criminal records although they had been obliged to disclose such information to the parties and to the court at the time of their selection; and that the presiding judge had failed to sum up all the evidence in his directions to the jury, in particular failing to sum up the victims’ and witnesses’ statements. The Supreme Court remitted the case to the Magadan Regional Court for fresh examination. 22.On 21 December 2004 the Regional Court received the case file. It adjourned its hearing twice, on 31 January and 7February 2005, as the second applicant’s lawyer had failed to appear. 23.In a decision of 8 February 2005 the Regional Court imposed on the defendants an undertaking not to leave their place of residence without its authorisation, to appear before it when summoned, and not to obstruct the proceedings. 24.The Regional Court’s decision of the same date to remit the case to the Magadan Regional Prosecutor for the rectification of errors in the indictment was appealed against by the defence and quashed as erroneous by the Supreme Court on 26 April 2005. 25.The hearing before the Regional Court was adjourned on 17June 2005 as a result of the first applicant’s and a co-defendant’s failure to appear, for unknown reasons. It was adjourned again on 21 June 2005 owing to a co-defendant’s hospitalisation and the impossibility of examining the case in respect of the others in separate proceedings. 26.The hearing resumed on 22 November 2005. On that day, however, fewer than twenty candidate jurors appeared before the court instead of the thirty invited and the court, therefore, ordered that another 100candidate jurors be summoned. 26.The hearing resumed on 22 November 2005. On that day, however, fewer than twenty candidate jurors appeared before the court instead of the thirty invited and the court, therefore, ordered that another 100candidate jurors be summoned. 26.The hearing resumed on 22 November 2005. On that day, however, fewer than twenty candidate jurors appeared before the court instead of the thirty invited and the court, therefore, ordered that another 100candidate jurors be summoned. 27.On 6 December 2005 the Regional Court ordered that the applicants and the other two defendants be detained on remand. It noted the applicants’ previous convictions, the serious charges against them, and the fact that during the preliminary investigation and the current trial some of the victims and witnesses had expressed fears of unlawful behaviour by the defendants. In its decision it did not give any details concerning the fears referred to, or the names of the defendants concerned. The applicants’ appeals against the detention order were dismissed by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation in its decision of 22February 2006. In upholding the Regional Court’s detention order, the Supreme Court noted that one of the victims, MrYa.B., had asked for the case to be examined without his participation as he had been afraid to give evidence in open court. This fear constituted, according to the Supreme Court, a sufficient ground to consider that the defendants did not satisfy the condition of not obstructing the proceedings in order for them to remain free under the previously imposed undertaking not to leave their place of residence. The applicants’ detention was subsequently extended for similar reasons. 27.On 6 December 2005 the Regional Court ordered that the applicants and the other two defendants be detained on remand. It noted the applicants’ previous convictions, the serious charges against them, and the fact that during the preliminary investigation and the current trial some of the victims and witnesses had expressed fears of unlawful behaviour by the defendants. In its decision it did not give any details concerning the fears referred to, or the names of the defendants concerned. The applicants’ appeals against the detention order were dismissed by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation in its decision of 22February 2006. In upholding the Regional Court’s detention order, the Supreme Court noted that one of the victims, MrYa.B., had asked for the case to be examined without his participation as he had been afraid to give evidence in open court. This fear constituted, according to the Supreme Court, a sufficient ground to consider that the defendants did not satisfy the condition of not obstructing the proceedings in order for them to remain free under the previously imposed undertaking not to leave their place of residence. The applicants’ detention was subsequently extended for similar reasons. 27.On 6 December 2005 the Regional Court ordered that the applicants and the other two defendants be detained on remand. It noted the applicants’ previous convictions, the serious charges against them, and the fact that during the preliminary investigation and the current trial some of the victims and witnesses had expressed fears of unlawful behaviour by the defendants.

This fear constituted, according to the Supreme Court, a sufficient ground to consider that the defendants did not satisfy the condition of not obstructing the proceedings in order for them to remain free under the previously imposed undertaking not to leave their place of residence. The applicants’ detention was subsequently extended for similar reasons. 28.On 9 December 2005 the jury was empanelled and sworn in and the court held hearings on 12, 20 and 23 December 2005. On the last-mentioned date one of the co-defendants was granted leave to engage a new lawyer. On 27December his new lawyer failed to appear and the hearing was adjourned until 10January 2006, 1-9 January being non-working days. The Regional Court continued the examination of the case in January. It ruled on numerous procedural requests by the defence, in particular requests seeking the replacement of the presiding judge and the prosecutor. 29.As the witnesses and victims who lived in Sinegorye had failed to appear at the hearings several times, on 17 January the court ordered them to be brought before it under escort. The hearing was adjourned on 20January until 27 January and on 26 February until 10 March 2006, pending the execution of that order. 30.The examination of the case continued in February, March, April and May 2006. During this time the hearing was adjourned on a number of occasions for about four weeks in total at the request of jurors who could not participate, and for about a week at the request of one of the defence lawyers, who was ill. On 2 June 2006 the presiding judge declared the examination of the evidence closed. In five sessions in June 2006 the Regional Court heard the parties’ oral argument. It announced a break from 14July until 3 October 2006 in view of the fact that several jurors were leaving for their summer holidays in central Russia. 31.The hearing resumed on 3 October 2006. Having consulted the parties, the court decided that they would repeat their oral argument. They did so on 6, 12 and 19 October and 2 November 2006. The preparation of questions to be put to the jury then followed. The jury gave its verdict on 17November 2006. The first applicant was found not guilty and was released in the courtroom. 32.On 5 December 2006, after an examination of the legal issues during the sessions held in November and December, the Regional Court delivered its judgment. The first applicant was acquitted and his right to rehabilitation was acknowledged. The second applicant was convicted of extortion (against MrV.B.), and “arbitrary unlawful acts” with the use of violence (in respect of MrYa.B.), and was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment (which took into account his 2001 conviction, in respect of which the conditional sentence was revoked). He was acquitted on the remaining charges. His detention on remand was to continue until the judgment took effect. 33.On 6 June 2007 the Supreme Court examined the appeals against the judgment lodged by a co-defendant, one of the victims and the prosecution. It found that the defendants and their lawyers had breached the rules on criminal trials by committing an abuse of their rights, namely, by discussing in the jurors’ presence, despite the presiding judge’s warnings, issues which fell outside the scope of the jurors’ competence. They had also made remarks which did not concern the issues to be decided by the jury and which had been aimed at discrediting the evidence against them, thus creating a negative impression of the victims and the presiding judge, and a positive one of themselves. This was held by the Supreme Court to have unlawfully influenced the jury’s verdict. It was also noted that the jury’s verdict had not been entirely clear as some of the answers to the questions put to them had been contradictory. The Supreme Court quashed the judgment and remitted the case to the Regional Court for a fresh examination. It also ordered that the second applicant remain in custody. 34.In August 2007 the first applicant was detained on remand in connection with an unrelated set of criminal proceedings brought against him on suspicion of an extortion allegedly committed in 2002. 35.On 4 September 2007 the Magadan Regional Court received the case file and opened the proceedings. On 5 October 2007 fewer than twenty candidate jurors appeared before the Regional Court instead of the 100invited and the court, therefore, ordered that another 150candidate jurors be summoned. 36.On 2 November 2007 the selection of the jurors began. However, after a number of candidate jurors refused to sit in the case, the number available was still insufficient and the court ordered that another 150candidate jurors be summoned. The same situation occurred on 22November 2007. 37.The number of candidate jurors who appeared before the Regional Court was again insufficient on 11 December 2007 and 17 January 2008, necessitating the summoning of an additional 200 and 250persons respectively. 38.A jury, composed of twelve jurors and two substitute jurors, was empanelled on 5 February 2008 from thirty-four candidate jurors who had appeared before the court, and the trial commenced. The court held five or six sessions monthly from February to June2008, two sessions in July, four in August (after a break for the jurors’ holidays from 1 July to 18August), eleven in September, six in October, ten in November and four in December 2008. Some of the sessions were held without the jury as they concerned various procedural issues, including the admissibility of evidence and requests for the examination of the evidence before the jury. The court examined the vast body of evidence, including the testimony of more than seventy victims and witnesses, and numerous expert reports. 39.For about a month the trial was delayed because a co-defendant was ill. Some delay was caused by difficulties in ensuring the appearance of some of the victims and witnesses, who resided in remote settlements in Burkhala and Sinegorye, or who had moved to the central and other parts of the country. 40.On 13 February 2009 the Regional Court started hearing the parties’ oral argument. 41.On 7 March 2009 the jury returned a “not guilty” verdict in respect of the first applicant. It found the second applicant guilty of “arbitrary unlawful acts” and not guilty on the remaining charges. 42.On 12 March 2009 the Regional Court ordered the second applicant’s release on an undertaking not to leave his place of residence and to behave in a law-abiding manner. 43.On 19 March 2009 it delivered its judgment, acquitting the first applicant and finding, in respect of the second applicant, that on 11October 2001 he, MrGrishin and MrN.G. (against whom the criminal proceedings were terminated owing to his death) had requested MrYa.B. to repay a debt in the amount of 100,000 Russian roubles (RUB); following MrYa.B.’s refusal MrGrishin and MrN.G. had beaten him up; the second applicant had beaten up MrS.K., who had witnessed MrYa.B.’s beating; they had then taken MrYa.B. to his home and MrGrishin had taken money from him in the amount of RUB247,000. 44.The Regional Court noted that there had been mixed references in the materials of the case about the second applicant, who had been characterised negatively by the local authority and by a district police officer at the place of his residence, and positively by the administration of a detention facility, in which he had been detained on remand, and by the administration of a prison in which he had served his sentence after a previous conviction. 45.The Regional Court convicted the second applicant, under Article330 § 2 of the CC, of “arbitrary unlawful acts” with the use of violence, sentenced him to two years and ten months’ imprisonment, revoked the conditional sentence under his 2001 conviction as the new crime had been committed during the probation period, and, after adding the revoked conditional sentence, sentenced him to a total of four years and five months’ imprisonment; it discharged him from serving the sentence in the part relating to the conviction under Article330§2 as liability for the relevant offence had become time-barred, and found that he had served his sentence in the remaining part in view of his detention on remand from 24April 2003 to 22 June 2004 and from 6 December 2005 to 12March 2009, which amounted to four years, five months and six days in total. It acquitted him on the remaining charges. 46.As of 19 March 2009 the first applicant was still detained in connection with unrelated criminal proceedings against him (see paragraph34 above). 47.On 23 July 2009 the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by a codefendant and the prosecution and upheld the judgment. 48.During the applicants’ detention on remand they were taken to the Magadan Regional Court from their detention facility by police guards. During the hearings they sat on a bench enclosed on four sides by metal rods 10 millimetres in diameter. The enclosure was 255 centimetres long, 150centimetres wide and 225centimetres high, with a steel mesh ceiling and a door, also made of metal rods. The distance between the metal rods was 19centimetres. 49.Armed police guards remained beside the caged dock. There were always two police guards per detainee – eight police guards in total during the first and second trials and six police guards for the applicants and one of their co-defendants during the third trial. 50.After the first applicant’s acquittal had become final he brought proceedings against the State for damage suffered as a result of the criminal proceedings against him. 51.On 23 October 2009 the Magadan Regional Court awarded him RUB18,569 in respect of pecuniary damage, representing an unemployment allowance that had not been paid as a result of his detention on remand. On 17 December 2009 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the Regional Court’s judgment. 52.On 1March 2010 the Magadan Town Court awarded the first applicant RUB50,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage incurred by him as a result of his criminal prosecution, the imposition on him of an undertaking not to leave his place of residence and his detention on remand from 9October 2002 to the moment of his release, following the first “not guilty” jury verdict of 22 June 2004 and from 6 December 2005 until 17November 2006. The applicant appealed against the judgment arguing, inter alia, that the amount awarded to him was not just or reasonable. On 30March 2010 the Magadan Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the Town Court’s judgment. 53.Article 21 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation reads, in the relevant part, as follows: “1.Human dignity shall be protected by the State. Nothing may serve as a basis for derogation therefrom.>No one shall be subjected to torture, violence or other severe or degrading treatment or punishment ...” 54.Article 9 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation prohibits, inter alia, the degrading treatment of participants in criminal proceedings. 55.An unpublished circular of 3 February 1993 issued jointly by the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation (no. 5-63-96), the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation (no. 11-nk/7) and the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation (no. 1/483) contained “proposals on creating the proper conditions for courts’ examination of criminal cases and the safety of trial participants and the guards of the internal troops and police escorts in the performance of their duties”. It directed the presidents of courts of general jurisdiction “to ensure, before 1 January 1994, the fitting of all the courtrooms with special fixed metal barriers separating defendants in criminal cases from the court bench and the visitors attending the hearing”. It also instructed prisoner escort officers to place behind those “barriers” any defendants who were in custody. 56.The Directions on Guarding and Transferring Suspects and Accused, preapproved by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Justice and the Prosecutor General’s Office, and approved by the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation on 26January 1996 by Order no.41 (dsp) “for internal use only”, provided for the placement of defendants behind the metal “barrier” in a courtroom. 57.A similar provision was included in the Directions on the Functioning of Temporary Detention Centres and Units for Guarding and Transferring Suspects and Accused, pre-approved by the Courts Administration Office at the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on 8February 2006 (no.CDAG/269) and the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation on 16 February 2006 (no.161306), and approved on 7March 2006 by order no.140 (dsp) “for internal use only” of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation. Under the latter Directions, the transfer of suspects and accused to courtrooms which are not equipped with the “safety barrier” (защитное ограждение, барьер) is prohibited. 58.Order no. 41 was challenged before the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation by a MrSh. on the ground that its provision on keeping defendants behind the metal “barrier” during their trials violated domestic law and the Convention in so far as both prohibited degrading treatment and guaranteed the right to a fair trial. He complained that he had actually been kept in a metal cage in a courtroom during his trial, and that it had made it impossible for him to communicate with his lawyer. 59.In its decision of 19October 2004 the Supreme Court, in a single judge formation, noted that the impugned provision concerned persons detained on remand by a court decision in accordance with the requirements of the Code of Criminal Procedure; and that it was the responsibility of the police to guard and transfer them to a courthouse from their detention facilities (Article 10 § 16 of the Police Act). The court reiterated that detention on remand was to be carried out in accordance with the principles of legality, fairness, presumption of innocence, equality before the law, humanism, and respect for human dignity, and in accordance with the Constitution, the principles and norms of international law, and the international agreements of the Russian Federation; furthermore such detention could not be accompanied by torture or other acts aimed at the infliction of physical or moral suffering (the Federal Law on the Detention of Suspects and Defendants). In view of the above, the Supreme Court was satisfied that the provision of the order for keeping defendants behind a metal “barrier” could not be regarded as impugning human honour and dignity or as violating the right to a fair trial. 60.MrSh. appealed against the Supreme Court’s decision arguing, inter alia, that the decision had not been accompanied by reasons. On 23December 2004 the appeals division of the Supreme Court in a threejudge formation dismissed his appeal and fully endorsed the findings at first instance. It noted that the disputed order had not set out the characteristics of the metal “barrier”. 61.Applications challenging the legality of both orders (that of 1996 and that of 2006, see paragraphs 56 and 57 above) on the basis of their lack of official publication were dismissed by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, which stated that the orders should not be published as they contained confidential information and had been registered with the Ministry of Justice (decision of 2December 2002, as upheld by the appeals division of the Supreme Court on 24 April 2003 in respect of order no.41, and decision of 7 December 2011 in respect of order no. 140). 62.On 2 December 1999 the Courts Administration Office at the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation approved, by order no. 154, the Rules on the Design and Construction of Courthouses for Courts of General Jurisdiction (SP311042000). The Rules were further approved by the Federal State Committee for Construction, Housing and Communal Services, and came into force on 1 August 2000. They were prepared by a group of experts including the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, the General Director of the Courts Administration Office at the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation and members of the Council of Judges of the Russian Federation. The Rules took account of the proposals set out in the joint circular of the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court and the Ministry of the Interior of 3 February 1993 (see paragraph55 above). 63.The Rules provided for a sub-zone for defendants in courtrooms for hearing criminal cases, enclosed on four sides with metal bars (металлическая заградительная решетка), consisting of metal rods of not less than 14 millimetres in diameter, 220centimetres high with a steelwire ceiling or extending up to the ceiling of the courtroom, and containing a door (paragraphs 5.4, 5.9 and 8.3 of the Rules). 64.Among other security arrangements the Rules provided for access from the defendants’ cells in the courthouse to the courtroom through separate corridors and stairs and a separate entry to the courtroom. The public entrance to the courthouse and to the courtroom for hearing criminal cases had to provide for the installation of metal detectors. Metal bars had to be installed on the windows in the courtroom (paragraphs 5.11, 5.35, 8.1 and8.2 of the Rules). 65.Since 1 July 2013 the design and layout of courthouses for courts of general jurisdiction has been regulated by Rules prepared by a group of experts from the Courts Administration Office at the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, architectural and construction organisations, and approved by the Federal Agency for Construction, Housing and Communal Services on 25December 2012. 66.The new Rules provide for two types of “safety cabins” (защитные кабины) in courtrooms for persons in custody, notably a “safety cabin” made of metal bars with characteristics identical to those in the old Rules (see paragraph63 above) and an “isolating transparent safety cabin” made of a steel carcass and bulletproof glass walls. Both cabins should be equipped with doors lockable from outside. 67.Under the general provision in Article 108 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, detention on remand could be ordered by a court in respect of persons suspected or accused of having committed a criminal offence punishable by more than two years’ imprisonment (three years’ imprisonment since December 2012), provided that a less restrictive preventive measure, such as, for example, an undertaking not to leave one’s place of residence, personal surety or bail, could not be applied. Persons suspected or accused of having committed a criminal offence punishable by lesser terms of imprisonment could still be remanded in custody in exceptional circumstances, notably if they had no permanent place of residence, their identity had not been established, or they had breached a previously imposed preventive measure or absconded. 68.A court was required to consider whether there were sufficient grounds to believe that the accused might abscond, reoffend or obstruct the proceedings (ibid., Article 97). Other circumstances, such as the seriousness of the charge, the accused’s personality, his age, state of health, family status and occupation, also had to be taken into account (ibid., Article 99). 69.As a result of amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure between December 2009 and November 2012, persons suspected or accused of some non-violent crimes against property and in the sphere of economic activity can no longer be detained on remand. 70.At its meeting on 20 March 2014, after consideration of communication No. 1405/2005, submitted by Mikhail Pustovoit against Ukraine, the UN Human Rights Committee adopted the Views that MrPustovoit’s placement in a metal cage during his public trial, with his hands handcuffed behind his back, had violated Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights taken separately, on account of the degrading treatment thereby inflicted on him, and in conjunction with Article 14 (1) of the Covenant, on account of the degrading treatment which had affected the fairness of his trial (paragraphs9.3 and 10 of the Views). 71.The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, adopted by the First United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders in 1955 and approved by the Economic and Social Council by its resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977, include the following guiding principle concerning instruments of restraint: “33.Instruments of restraint, such as handcuffs, chains, irons and straitjackets, shall never be applied as a punishment. Furthermore, chains or irons shall not be used as restraints. Other instruments of restraint shall not be used except in the following circumstances: (a)As a precaution against escape during a transfer, provided that they shall be removed when the prisoner appears before a judicial or administrative authority; ...” 72.The Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (Rule 83) and of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (Rule 83) provide that instruments of restraint, such as handcuffs, may be used only as a precaution against escape during transfer or for security reasons; however, once the accused appears before the court, instruments of restraint shall be removed. 73.Article 63 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provides as follows: “1.The accused shall be present during the trial.>If the accused, being present before the Court, continues to disrupt the trial, the Trial Chamber may remove the accused and shall make provision for him or her to observe the trial and instruct counsel from outside the courtroom, through the use of communications technology, if required. Such measures shall be taken only in exceptional circumstances after other reasonable alternatives have proved inadequate, and only for such duration as is strictly required.” 74.The Amnesty International Fair Trials Manual states as follows: “15.3Procedures impinging on the presumption of innocence ... Particular attention should be paid that no attributes of guilt are borne by the accused during the trial which might impact on the presumption of their innocence. Such attributes could include holding the accused in a cell within the courtroom ...” 75.A “metal cage” has been used as a standard security measure in respect of suspects and accused appearing before a court while in custody in some member States of the Council of Europe, such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.Armenia and Georgia have abandoned its use (see Ashot Harutyunyan v. Armenia, no. 34334/04, §118, 15June 2010, and the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers’ Resolution CM/ResDH(2011)105). Moldova and Ukraine are in the process of doing so (see, in respect of Ukraine, the Transitional Provisions of the 2012 Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine, notably paragraph21 of SectionXI, which directed the Cabinet of Ministers to submit proposals to parliament to secure funding for replacement of the “metal screen cages” in courtrooms with “glass or organic glass screens”). In Azerbaijan, while in some courts “metal cages” have been replaced by “glass barriers” (see, for example, Section 3 “Developments in the Justice Sector” of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe 2011 Trial Monitoring Report on Azerbaijan), their continued use is provided for by the Instruction of the Ministry of Justice of Azerbaijan of 29December 2012 on the Procedures for Escorting Arrested and Convicted Persons and the Instruction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Azerbaijan of 14January 2013 on the Procedures for the Guarding and Escorting by the Police of Persons Kept in Temporary Detention Facilities. 76.Some other member States use “cages” for security reasons in certain circumstances or in certain courts. For example, in the Serious Crimes Court in Albania the accused may be placed in a dock enclosed by metal bars. There is one courtroom in Serbia – in the District (Central) Prison in Belgrade – as an auxiliary courtroom of the High Court in Belgrade, in which the dock is enclosed by metal bars and bulletproof glass. In France, some courts use glass docks, which in rare cases are reinforced with steel cables and used pursuant to a decision by the presiding judge of the court. In Latvia, although a minority of tribunals still have metal cages, that practice is falling into disuse.

79,001-70662,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicant was born in 1938 and currently lives in Lancashire. 10.In 1953 he joined the British army at 15 years of age. He served with the Royal Engineers between February 1954 and April 1968, when he was discharged for reasons unrelated to the present application. In 1981 he was diagnosed as suffering from hypertension and late onset bronchial asthma and in 1989 he was found to have high blood pressure and chronic obstructive airways disease (bronchitis – COAD). He has not worked since 1992 or thereabouts and is registered as an invalid. 11.The Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment at Porton Down (“Porton Down”) was established during the First World War in order to conduct research into chemical weapons with a view to advancing the protection of the United Kingdom's armed forces against such weapons. The research included tests of gases on humans as well as on animals. Servicemen who participated in the tests were paid extra wages. 12.The applicant participated in such tests at Porton Down. While there was some debate as to whether he attended in 1962, it was not disputed that he did so in July 1963. His service medical records contained no record of any tests at Porton Down. 13.The applicant alleged as follows. In the spring of 1962 he was invited to Porton Down; he was medically examined on arrival; he was asked on three or four occasions to enter a sealed and unventilated room, where he was seated and strapped to a chair; over a period of about six hours, drops of mustard gas were applied to patches of tissue which were then taped to his skin; he was told that, if he was unlucky, he might suffer temporary pain or discomfort but otherwise he was not given any, or any proper, warning about the possible consequences of the tests for his health; once the tests were finished he returned to his unit; there was no further medical examination after he left Porton Down. He relied on a memorandum and file note of 13 November 1989 (see paragraph 24 below) and on the conclusions in this respect of 14 January 2004 of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal (“the PAT” – see paragraph 63 below) to substantiate his participation in tests in 1962. 14.While the Government did not deny that participation, they pointed to a number of matters that appeared to militate against such a conclusion: the summary and alphabetical record books did not refer to his attendance in 1962 but only to his attendance in 1963; there was no documentary evidence at all of the 1962 tests whereas certain records existed of his 1963 tests; and if the PAT had accepted his participation in the 1962 tests, this was based solely on his recollections. 15.The nerve gas (known as “G-agent” or “GF”) test is described in the relevant records as “exposure to single-breath GF”. The applicant alleged that he was told before the test that the experiment “could not harm a mouse”; that he was placed in an air-tight, glass-partitioned cubicle containing a face mask, the mask was placed over his mouth and nose, the fitting was checked and the chamber was sealed; that a loudspeaker informed him that the test was about to begin and to inhale normally; that he felt an immediate tightening of the chest muscles and lungs which wore off after the end of the test; and that blood samples were taken at regular intervals during the following twenty-four hours. The Government submitted that diluted GF vapours were put into a gas chamber and, as the name of the test suggested, volunteers took a single breath of air with calculated doses of GF gas through a tube connected to that chamber, they held their breath for two seconds and then exhaled. 16.The other test involved mustard gas and was described in the records as “H sensitivity and penetration”. According to the applicant, it followed the same format as that in 1962. The Government added the following detail: the mustard gas test was designed to test the performance of protective clothing and was carried out in two parts. The first was a sensitivity test to determine an individual's sensitivity to mustard gas and it involved the placement of a dilute solution of the gas on the participant's upper arm. If after twenty-four hours the test subject had a small red mark, he or she was deemed too sensitive and did not participate any further in the tests. On the other hand, if the participant was not demonstrably sensitive, the second part consisted of putting a drop of dilute mustard gas solution on three samples of protective clothing left in place on the participant's body and the skin under the clothing was examined after six and then twenty-four hours. The participants were monitored before and after the tests. The rooms were properly ventilated, the dosages were small and safe and the tests were carefully planned and controlled. 17.From 1981 the applicant was medically treated for breathlessness and high blood pressure and by 1987 these problems had significantly worsened. He began to search for his Porton Down records through what he described as “medical” and “political” channels. 18.In response to his doctor's enquiry, in late 1987 the Ministry of Defence (MOD) supplied his doctor with his service medical records on a “medical in confidence” basis. Those records did not refer to the applicant's Porton Down tests. 19.In a letter of 14 November 1989, Porton Down responded to another enquiry from his doctor. The letter was sent on a “medical in confidence” basis and confirmed the applicant's participation in a GF gas test in July 1963. That GF test had been preceded and succeeded by a full medical examination which revealed no abnormality. The letter also referred (inaccurately, as it later emerged – see paragraph 36 below) to seven blood tests conducted after the GF test and to their results and confirmed that “peak flow meter measurements” had also been taken from the applicant and that “breath-holding tests”, a clothing penetration study (apparently, although not expressly noted, the mustard gas tests) and a battery of personality tests were performed. The results of these tests were not included in the letter and no other records supporting the statements made in the letter were enclosed. His doctor's stamp on it indicates that he decided to tell the applicant that all was normal. The applicant persuaded his doctor to show him the letter in 1994. 20.By a letter dated 14 December 1989, a consultant informed the applicant's doctor that he doubted that the applicant's bronchial asthma was caused by his exposure to nerve gas. Further tests were to be carried out. 21.A letter from Dr H. (a professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds and later the court-appointed expert witness in the PAT proceedings – see paragraphs 42-68 below) dated 5 December 1994 to the applicant stated that full and detailed records were required to judge the long-term effects of his participation in the tests and that a long-term epidemiological study would have been useful either to establish that there were long-term effects or to reassure test participants that there were none. His letter of 10 July 1996 repeated his view as to the need for such a study. 22.An internal Porton Down memorandum of 24 November 1997 noted that certain blood-test figures given in the letter to the applicant's doctor of 14 November 1989 were inaccurate. In addition, it was considered that the applicant's description of the tests was roughly consistent with the procedures in the 1960s. While there were no obvious gaps in the 1960s records, it could not be said that the records were complete: the applicant could have attended in 1962 and his name could have been omitted or incorrectly recorded due to a clerical error. 23.Inter alia, the applicant carried out a sit-in hunger strike at Porton Down, held a press conference in the House of Commons and requested members of parliament to put parliamentary questions. 24.Between 11 and 14 November 1989, the applicant went on hunger strike outside Porton Down. On 13 November 1989 he spoke with the Secretary of Porton Down. The latter noted in a memorandum of that date that the applicant's description of the tests was strong enough to indicate that he had been there and he recommended a further search of the records. He also recorded in a file note (of the same date) that the applicant's description of his visits to Porton Down in 1962 and 1963 left him with a level of confidence that he had been a volunteer there on both occasions. This led to the letter of 14 November 1989 to the applicant's doctor (see paragraph 19 above). 25.In January 1994 the applicant formed the Porton Down Volunteers Association with the object of seeking recognition and redress for test participants. The association has over 300 members to date. 26.By a letter dated 26 January 1994, the Chief Executive of Porton Down answered, at the request of the Secretary of State for Defence, a series of questions raised by a member of parliament about chemical and biological warfare testing. The Chief Executive's letter described the test procedure, stating that participants were given a medical examination before and after the tests and recalled for check-ups “from time to time”. It was pointed out that there was no evidence that the health of participants had deteriorated because of their test participation. On 22 June 1994 the Chief Executive confirmed the well-established policy of the MOD of releasing service medical records to a veteran's doctor on a “medical in confidence” basis. The Chief Executive's letter of 7 March 1995 (in response to a parliamentary question to the Minister of State for Defence) noted that the tests did not include any plan for long-term systematic monitoring of participants: any monitoring thereafter was purely ad hoc and sporadic. 27.On 2 February 1994 the applicant wrote to the MOD requesting copies of his medical records and of reports on the relevant tests. The reply of 9 March 1994 from Porton Down recalled the MOD policy of release on a “medical in confidence” basis. The applicant's doctor had been provided with information in 1989 on this basis. It was “entirely up to your own doctor how much or how little of this information he conveys to you”. Further queries from the applicant led to a similar response from Porton Down by letter dated 20 April 1994. 28.On 12 December 1994 Lord Henley stated in the House of Lords that the MOD would continue to send veterans to their doctors and would release medical records as appropriate. Information was provided to doctors to allow proper diagnosis and “would be released, if necessary”. He repeated that there was no evidence over the previous forty years that test participants had suffered harm to their health. 29.In response to a series of parliamentary questions put to the Secretary of State for Defence as to the necessity for a public inquiry, the government's representative replied on 28 February 1995 that there was no evidence that any test participants had suffered any long-term damage to their health in the past four decades. Similar responses as to the lack of evidence of harm to the test participants were given by the Minister of State for Defence in Parliament on 4 April and 2 May 1995 in response to questions concerning the instigation of a study into the long-term health effects of exposure to chemical and biological substances. 30.On 25 April 1995 the applicant and the Labour Party defence spokesman took part in a press conference on the question of Porton Down volunteers and their requirements. 31.Following a meeting between them, on 2 December 1997 the Minister of State for Defence wrote to the applicant. He referred to the concerns of the applicant (and other test participants) that information about the tests was being withheld. He confirmed that this was not the case but rather reflected “less than thorough” record-keeping than would be currently expected. Henceforth all volunteers would be able to obtain access to all the information held on them at Porton Down and steps would be taken to declassify reports so as to make that information more accessible. Certain copies of test documents were enclosed: (a) the alphabetical record book which recorded the applicant's attendance at Porton Down between 13 and 19 July 1963; (b) the summary record book which referred to the two tests carried out on the applicant involving GF and mustard gas and listed the monitoring procedures that were to be carried out on the applicant (chest X-rays, peak flow meter tests, “x 3 x alcohol” quiz, breath-holding tests and blood tests); and (c) a report entitled “Effects of Inhaled GF on Man” which described the single breath GF test and contained an analysis of the results of the tests carried out on fifty-six participants, believed to include the applicant's test. It was indicated that these documents were available to any test participant who requested them. This was the first material obtained by the applicant about his participation in the tests. The letter went on to note that much GF-related research work had already been published in open literature or was in the Public Record Office. The review of files to be disclosed would continue and the applicant was given a list of all relevant research papers already published between 1957 and 1987. There was no evidence to date to suggest that any volunteer had suffered long-term adverse effects. A full independent and long-term study of the health impacts of test participation was not, however, considered feasible or practical so none had been or would be carried out. 32.In a letter dated 31 August 1999 to the PAT, Porton Down indicated that it was well acquainted with the applicant, having received numerous communications from him and from members of parliament. 33.By a letter dated 3 May 2001, Porton Down informed the applicant that it had discovered some old laboratory notebooks that included information about the 1963 tests: one book included some previously unavailable details of the mustard patch tests. A pre-exposure chest X-ray and the associated report card were also now available. The applicant was to contact Porton Down if he wanted to see this material or obtain copies. 34.As well as those disclosed with the Minister of State's letter of 2December 1997, the following documents were also submitted to the Court. 35.The Government indicated that these were all the relevant records that could be traced: (a) an extract from a laboratory record of results of personality and intelligence tests; (b) extracts from laboratory records of GF blood tests – seven blood samples were taken from the applicant; and (c) an explanation of the GF blood-test results. 36.The Government corrected their previous explanations of the seven blood samples (see paragraph 19 above): one was taken on 13 July 1963, a second one prior to the applicant's exposure to GF and the remaining five were taken later. They also corrected other errors relating to information provided in their earlier observations about those tests including the following: “the reference to '25 milligrams of GF [vapour per kilogram of body weight]' appears to have been a typographical error. In fact, calculated doses of GF ranged from 0.16 to 2.84 microgrammes per kilogramme of body weight.” They also disclosed documents recently discovered following a further search: (a) the applicant's pre-exposure X-ray and its associated report card (see paragraph 33 above); (b) a report dated August 1942 which described the manner in which the sensitivity tests to mustard gas were performed and entitled “Technique of the Physiological Experiments Carried Out on the Human Subjects at [Porton Down]”; and (c) extracts from a laboratory notebook entitled “Overgarment Tests. Mustard on Men”, relating to mid-July 1963 and referring to the applicant. 37.On 10 June 1991 the applicant claimed a service pension on the grounds of “hypertension/breathing problems” resulting from the Porton Down tests (and, in addition, from his radiation exposure on Christmas Island during the relevant nuclear tests there). The Department of Social Security (DSS) obtained copies of his service and civilian medical records together with a report from his doctor, which confirmed that he suffered from hypertension, COAD and late onset bronchial asthma. On 28January 1992 the Secretary of State rejected his claim for a service pension as there was no causal link demonstrated between the tests and those medical conditions. The applicant did not pursue an appeal at that stage. 38.The applicant consulted solicitors in 1994 and obtained legal aid for proceedings. By a letter dated 14 November 1994 to the Secretary of State, his solicitors threatened proceedings, alleging, inter alia, negligence, assault and breach of statutory duty on the part of the MOD, and demanding the release of all medical and laboratory records in the possession of the Secretary of State or of Porton Down as regards the test periods in 1962 and 1963, failing which the applicant would apply to the High Court for pre-action discovery. The applicant's representatives met with MOD representatives in early January 1995 on a “without prejudice” basis and by a letter dated 5 June 1995 requested confirmation from the MOD as to whether a certificate would be issued under section 10 of the 1947 Act (“a section 10 certificate”). 39.By a letter dated 4 July 1995 to the applicant's solicitors, the claims section of the MOD wrote as follows: “War Pensions Agency has informed me that a section 10 certificate in respect of acute bronchitis (1963), a bruised knee and loss of hearing will be regarded as attributable to service and a section 10 certificate will be issued. The other ailments for which [the applicant] claimed a war pension have not been regarded as attributable to service.” 40.On 3 August 1995 a section 10 certificate was signed by the Secretary of State: “In so far as the personal injury of [the applicant] is due to anything suffered as a result of his service in the Army between 16 February 1954 and 2 April 1968, I hereby certify that his suffering that thing has been treated as attributable to service for the purpose of entitlement to an award under the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983, which relates to disablement or death of members of the Army.” 41.By a letter dated 8 August 1995, the Treasury Solicitor provided a copy of the section 10 certificate to the applicant's representatives. 42.Following the judgment of this Court in McGinley and Egan v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III) and the Government's disclosure of certain documents in their observations in the present case (on 9 March 1998), the applicant requested an adjournment of the present application in order to pursue an appeal to the PAT and, in particular, disclosure of documents under Rule 6 of the Pensions Appeal Tribunals (England and Wales) Rules 1980 (“the PAT Rules”). The present application was adjourned. 43.On 1 June 1998 he lodged his PAT appeal. Since the War Pensions Agency (“the WPA” – a specialised agency of the Department of Social Security) clarified that a further form was required, on 8 November 1998 the applicant re-lodged the appeal. 44.In February 1999 the applicant received his “Statement of Case”. He obtained two extensions of the time-limit for the submission of his “answer” to the Statement of Case (to take advice from an expert chemical pathologist on the documents already disclosed and on those which were also to be requested during the PAT appeal and to consider the intervening observations of the Government in the present application) and he indicated that he would be making an application under Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules. 45.On 30 July 1999 his answer was submitted to the WPA along with a letter which noted that the answer included an application for disclosure of documents under Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules: paragraph 18 of the answer set out a list of seventeen categories of document required by him under that rule. 46.On 10 August 1999 the WPA responded by pointing out that enquiries were being made to obtain all the information requested under Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules. Once received, the WPA would ask for the agreement of the President of the PAT to disclose it. 47.On the same day the WPA wrote to Porton Down enclosing a copy of the applicant's Rule 6 request and asking for the information as soon as possible so that the agreement of the President of the PAT could be obtained. 48.On 14 March and 13 April 2000 the WPA sent the supplementary Statement of Case (now incorporating the supplemental medical evidence) to the applicant and to the PAT, respectively. 49.On 3 August 2000 the President of the PAT responded to the applicant's enquiry, indicating that his case had not been listed as it awaited production of further documentary evidence and the Secretary of State's response. However, since the Rule 6 request should not have been made in the applicant's answer to the Statement of Case, that request had just come to light. The applicant was to confirm to the President if he intended paragraph 18 of his answer to constitute his Rule 6 request and, if so, the President would be grateful to receive any observations that would assist his consideration of the relevance of the documents to the appeal issues. The applicant was also to identify the State department to which a Rule 6 direction should be addressed. 50.On 9 November 2000 the applicant confirmed to the President of the PAT that paragraph 18 of his answer did indeed constitute his Rule 6 request and he made detailed submissions on the matters requested by the President. 51.By a letter dated 13 November 2000, the President of the PAT requested the applicant to submit a draft direction and attend a hearing on it since he was concerned that the wording of some parts of the Rule 6 request appeared to be ambiguous and lacking in clarity. The applicant submitted a draft direction (essentially listing those documents already included in paragraph 18 of his answer). 52.By an order dated 1 February 2001, the President of the PAT directed, pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules, disclosure of the scheduled documents by the Secretary of State since the documents “were likely to be relevant to the issues to be determined in the appeal”. 53.On 6 July 2001 the Secretary of State responded to the direction of the President of the PAT. It was marked “medical in confidence”. It referred to the documents already submitted by the Government to this Court (see paragraphs 34-36 above). The Secretary of State was unable to give a definitive response to the request for the fifth category of document required (namely, “any scientific or medical reports, whether published or prepared for internal use by Porton Down, the [MOD] or other government departments or agencies of the volunteer studies or experiments in Porton Down between 1957 and 1968 which were similar or related to the studies or experiments in which [the applicant] was involved”). A full and careful review had been undertaken and was a time-consuming process. Many of the documents identified as being possibly relevant to the request were classified. The Secretary of State had asked for an urgent review of the classification to be undertaken and, once the review was completed, he would let the PAT have his full response. Otherwise the Secretary of State provided various explanations of the documents already submitted by the Government to this Court and details of the precise dates on which the applicant would have participated in the tests, of the levels of exposure to gases and of various headings and abbreviations in the disclosed documents. The only documents (additional to those already submitted to this Court) disclosed to the PAT were the applicant's service and payment records, the latter of which included a payment for attendance for a week at Porton Down in July 1963. 54.The MOD's letter was passed to the applicant on 25 July 2001. By a letter dated 19 July 2002, the applicant wrote to the PAT apologising for not having responded and explaining the reasons for the delay. 55.By a letter dated 23 August 2002, the MOD disclosed documents concerning the above-described fifth category: two reports entitled “The feasibility of performing follow-up studies of the health of volunteers attending [Porton Down]” and “The single-breath administration of Sarin”, from which individual names had been blanked out. The feasibility report acknowledged that the records held at Porton Down prior to the late 1970s generally consisted of the name, service number and age of participants at the date of testing but were not “sufficient to allow either a comprehensive morbidity study or mortality study to proceed”. While a study could be carried out on post-1976 test participants, “such a study would be of very limited value and may only serve to draw attention to [Porton Down's] interest in possible long-term health problems experienced by volunteers”. The feasibility report concluded that a comprehensive follow-up study of all volunteers was “impractical”. Porton Down's library catalogue had also mentioned a document entitled “Unique papers relating to early exposure of volunteers to GD [O-Pinacolyl methylphosphonoflouidate, commonly known as Soman] and GF and DM [diphenylaminearsine chloride, commonly known as Adamsite]”. However, a copy of this document could not be located. A letter of 20 August 2002 was also enclosed which certified that nine of the requested documents were “in the nature of departmental minutes or records” and would not therefore be disclosed (Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules). 56.A hearing was fixed for 3 October 2002. On 27 September 2002 the applicant was obliged to request an adjournment since his counsel had advised that further questions needed to be put to Dr H. On 30 September 2002 the PAT declined to adjourn, indicating that it was unlikely Dr H. could or would prepare a report. 57.On 2 October 2002 the MOD wrote to the PAT and the applicant. While nine documents had been previously certified as non-disclosable, (letter of 23 August 2002 – see paragraph 55 above), seven of those nine documents could now be disclosed. The MOD had “had the opportunity of re-examining the documents ... with a view to assessing whether [they] could be the subject of voluntary disclosure ... in an effort to ensure that everything that can be disclosed has been disclosed and so as to ensure the maximum openness and the maximum assistance to the [PAT]”. Certain blocking out had been done on some disclosed documents to protect the identities of staff involved and to excise irrelevant material. Two documents could still not be disclosed: the first did not appear “to contain anything of relevance” to the applicant's tests and, in any event, “contained information which remains security sensitive and is not properly subject to voluntary disclosure on security grounds”; and the second required permission from the United States before it could be disclosed. 58.The appeal was scheduled for 3 October 2002. The applicant applied for an adjournment supported by the Veterans Agency (the successor of the WPA – “the VA”). The PAT decision (delivered on 7 October 2002) recorded as follows: “The [PAT] are deeply disturbed that this application has proved necessary as a result of the [applicant's] advisers' failure to consider documents disclosed over a year ago, in a timely fashion. However, since the [VA] also appear to be without documentation and there is confusion by the [applicant] as to whether he also wishes to appeal for hypertension, we have reluctantly decided to allow the adjournment. It is highly unsatisfactory that Court resources have been wasted in this way. To prevent this happening in the future the Tribunal intend to exercise some control over the ongoing progress of the appeal.” The PAT was to clarify with the MOD the status of certain classified documents and the extent to which they could be released to the public, and directed the MOD to provide, by 21 October 2002, disclosure of further documents. The MOD, the VA and the applicant were to notify the PAT by 18 November 2002 of the questions and documents it wanted Dr H. to examine. It was intended that the PAT would add its own questions and submit a composite questionnaire to Dr H. who would report in response to the PAT. The applicant was also to confirm his position as regards the hypertension appeal by 28 October 2002. 59.On 21 October 2002, the MOD disclosed to the PAT three declassified documents. These were forwarded by the PAT to the applicant by a letter dated 8 November 2002, accompanied by a warning that the MOD had released the documents for the purpose of the appeal and that no information in them was to be used for any other purpose without the consent of the MOD. By a letter dated 25 October 2002, the applicant confirmed that his appeal had been intended to cover hypertension also, he explained the reasons for his confusion and he requested an extension of time to so appeal. A hypertension appeal form was lodged with the PAT on 5 December 2002. 60.By a letter dated 3 December 2002, the PAT wrote to Dr H. enclosing the documents disclosed by the MOD (at that point) with two sets of questions (prepared by the applicant and the medical member of the PAT). By a letter dated 19 February 2003, Dr H. provided the PAT with a report. The applicant having noted that Dr H. had omitted to respond to the PAT questions, Dr H. did so in a supplemental report sent to the PAT under cover of a letter dated 14 May 2003. 61.In a document dated 14 October 2003, the MOD submitted its comments on Dr H.'s reports. On 16 October 2003 the VA submitted a supplementary Statement of Case. 62.The PAT appeal hearing took place on 23 October 2003. It allowed the hypertension appeal to be heard out of time but, once it became clear that the VA had not processed the appeal documentation filed by the applicant, the PAT reluctantly granted the MOD an adjournment to allow the VA time to “properly consider all the evidential material and prepare a reasoned medical opinion”. The COAD appeal was, however, dismissed. 63.On 14 January 2004 the PAT delivered its written decision. As to the facts, the PAT accepted that the applicant had undergone tests for mustard gas “some time in 1962 as well as the documented tests in July 1963” despite the fact that there was no reference in his service records or in other research records to the 1962 test. The PAT also found “disquieting” the “difficulties” experienced by the applicant in obtaining the records which were produced to the PAT. The PAT also established the following facts: “1.We find that [the applicant] suffered no long-term respiratory effect from skin contact with mustard gas following both tests in 1962 and 1963.>We find that [the applicant] was administered only small doses of mustard gas and GF gas which would have resulted in minimal exposure to mustard gas by off-gassing and a limited and transitory reaction to the GF gas. Although no records relating to doses exist, the mustard gas tests were designed to test the suitability of military clothing to exposure and were not a gas test per se. Furthermore, after a fatality at Porton Down in 1953, safeguards were put in place to ensure that volunteers were only exposed to safe dosages.>The compelling weight of the evidence is that [the applicant] did not receive, in any of the tests, dosages likely to have long-term effects as described in the research papers. In particular, the [PAT expert], although accepting the possibility that given further research through a long-term follow-up study a link might be found, concludes that there is no evidence to link [the applicant's] exposure to either gases with his present condition. We accept [the PAT expert's] conclusion that, given the limited doses and [the applicant's] minimal immediate reactions, this would rule out a link between the tests and the claimed conditions.>We particularly rely on [Dr H.'s] expert report. He has analysed the specific data relevant to [the applicant's] case and considered the conditions for which he is claiming in relation to that specific data. The research papers relied on by the [applicant], although of some evidential value, are very general and speculative. We therefore prefer the evidence, and the conclusions reached by [Dr H.] in his reports.” The PAT also accepted, as a matter of law, that it was sufficient to show that the proved service event was only one of the causes of the condition even if there were other contributory factors. However, it stated: “2.We do not accept that the lack of possible evidence of other follow-up tests is sufficient to constitute reliable evidence.>We find that there is some reliable evidence surrounding the Porton Down tests for which [the applicant] volunteered. However, this evidence tends, if anything, to support the view that there is in fact no link between those tests and [the applicant's] current conditions. The test of reasonable doubt is not therefore met.>There is no reliable evidence to suggest a causal link between the tests for either mustard gas or GF gas and the claimed condition.>[The PAT expert's] views that 'he cannot exclude the possibility' of a link between exposure to GF and/or mustard gas and the claimed condition, does not meet the 'reasonable doubt' test. Furthermore, he 'rules out' exposure to GF as a cause and deems it 'unlikely' that mustard gas is a cause.>Finally, [the applicant's counsel] invites us to allow the appeal for reasons which can be summarised as 'general fairness'. The [PAT] does not have legislative or discretionary power to do so. The decision of the [PAT] is to disallow the appeal for [COAD].” 64.On 4 February 2004 the applicant applied to the PAT for leave to appeal to the High Court (on the COAD matter) and for a stay of the hypertension appeal then pending before the PAT. On 26 April 2004 leave was refused, the PAT's reserved decision being delivered on 28 April 2004. 65.On 11 May 2004 the applicant applied for leave to appeal to the High Court. On 13 July 2004 leave was granted. 66.The applicant's appeal notice and supporting skeleton argument were submitted on 10 August 2004. The appeal was listed to be heard on 7October 2004. 67.On 8 October 2004 the High Court allowed the appeal and referred the matter back to the PAT for a further hearing. 68.On 7 March 2005 a directions hearing was held before the PAT. It ordered the hypertension and COAD appeals to be heard together and mutual disclosure of any further documents relevant to the appeal by 18April 2005. On the latter date the Treasury Solicitor produced a “schedule of disclosure” listing and disclosing eleven documents: apart from three items, the applicant had not seen them before. The Treasury Solicitor maintained that disclosure of most of the documents (including two sets of minutes of meetings which Rule 6 specifies can be withheld) was not obligatory as they were of marginal relevance, noted that all documents had been downgraded to “unclassified” and indicated that the MOD would endeavour to produce the annexes referred to in certain documents. 69.The armed forces have, since 1998, put in place a service to deal with enquiries from Porton Down test participants (“the 1998 Scheme”). The relevant information pamphlet noted that participants could request their test records, that a search would be carried out for references to that person and for additional evidence of actual procedures, that a summary would be provided and that, if the person wanted to go to Porton Down, he or she could obtain the actual records. While the pamphlet noted that reasonably comprehensive records had existed since 1942, individuals had to accept that old records in some cases were very sparse, that record keeping in years gone by was not up to current standards and that in certain cases a person's attendance might not even have been marked. The pamphlet claimed that no participant was worse off after the Porton Down tests. 70.In 2001 the Porton Down Volunteers Medical Assessment Programme was established by the MOD to investigate health concerns of Porton Down test participants. The study involved 111 participants but no control group. The report, published in April 2004, was entitled “Clinical Findings in 111 Ex-Porton Down Volunteers”. It noted that over 20,000 had participated in the tests since Porton Down's establishment in 1916 and that 3,000 had participated in nerve gas tests and 6,000 in mustard gas tests, with some servicemen having been exposed to both. It concluded that: “On a clinical basis, no evidence was found to support the hypothesis that participation in Porton Down trials produced any long-term adverse health effects or unusual patterns of disease compared to those of the general population of the same age.” 71.From July 2002 the MOD funded “an initial pilot research project” on mortality and cancer incidence among Porton Down test participants. It compared 500 participants with a control group of 500 other servicemen and the decision was taken that a full-scale epidemiological study should be undertaken. By mid-2003 this had begun and it was expected to take about two years to complete. 72.Further to the death of Aircraftsman Maddison in May 1953 after being exposed to Sarin gas (also referred to as GB gas, a nerve agent related to GF), a coroner's inquest was held and recorded “death by misadventure”. An application was brought for a fresh inquest alleging, inter alia, that incomplete evidence had been brought before the coroner and in November 2002 the Court of Appeal ordered a fresh inquest. It concluded on 15November 2004 with the jury finding that the cause of Mr Maddison's death was the “application of a nerve agent in a non-therapeutic experiment”. Judicial review proceedings appear to be pending. In or around 2004-05 a non-governmental organisation (“Porton Down Veterans”) discovered during searches in the Public Record Office two letters of May and August 1953 containing legal advice from the Treasury Solicitor to the MOD about Mr Maddison's case and about section 10 of the 1947 Act. That organisation sent this material to the Veterans Policy Unit – Legacy Health Issues of the MOD on 7 February 2005. The Treasury Solicitor's letter of August 1953 noted as follows: “When the case was referred to me previously I did consider the relevance of section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 but I came to the conclusion that it had no application. On the information before me I am still of that opinion. Subsection (1) of that section, which deals with injuries caused by acts of members of the Armed Forces, can have no application since the administration of the GB gas to ... Maddison was (so I understand) carried out by [civilian] personnel and not by any member of the Armed Forces. Subsection (2) also seems inapplicable. [It] provides that no proceedings in tort are to lie against the Crown for death or personal injury due to anything suffered by a member of the Armed Forces if that thing is suffered by him 'in consequence of the nature or condition of any equipment or supplies used for the purposes of the Armed Forces of the Crown'. As I understand the facts of this case, GB gas cannot be said to be a 'supply used for the purposes of the Armed Forces' at all, it being purely an experimental substance and one which has never been used for the purposes of the Armed Forces. If this is correct, then section 10 of the 1947 Act cannot protect the Crown or the Minister from liability.” 73.It was a well-established and unqualified common-law rule that the Crown was neither directly nor vicariously liable in tort. 74.The rule was counterbalanced in several ways. Actions against the errant serviceman would be permitted in which case the Crown would invariably (if the defendant was acting in the course of his duty) accept responsibility for any damages awarded. In cases where the individual author of the injury could not be identified, a nominee defendant would be appointed to enable the claim to proceed. In addition, from 1919 a serviceman injured in the course of war service was entitled to a disability pension and his spouse to a pension. The scope of these entitlements later widened to include disability or death caused by injury attributable to any service in the armed forces (war service or not). A feature of these successive schemes was that entitlement to a pension did not depend on proof of fault against the Crown. 75.Further to strong criticism of the Crown's position as litigant, in the 1920s legislation was envisaged that would make the Crown liable in tort. The 1924 terms of reference of the drafting committee were to prepare a bill to provide, inter alia, that the Crown should become liable to be sued in tort. Clause 11 of the draft bill produced in 1927 (and never adopted) provided, under the heading “Substantive Rights”, that: “Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Crown shall, notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, be liable in tort.” This provision was made subject to clause29(1)(g) which read: “Except as therein otherwise expressly provided, nothing in this Act shall– ... (g)entitle any member of the armed forces of the Crown to make a claim against the Crown in respect of any matter relating to or arising out of or in connection with the discipline or duties of those forces or the regulations relating thereto, or the performance or enforcement or purported performance or enforcement thereof by any member of those forces, or other matters connected with or ancillary to any of the matters aforesaid ...” 76.The 1947 Act made far-reaching changes, both substantive and procedural, to the Crown's liability to be sued. 77.The 1947 Act was divided into four parts: Part I “Substantive law” (sections 1-12 of the Act); Part II “Jurisdiction and procedure”; Part III “Judgments and execution”; and Part IV “Miscellaneous”. 78.Section 1 provides for the Crown to be sued as of right rather than by a petition of right sanctioned by Royal fiat. 79.Section 2 of the 1947 Act provides: “Liability of the Crown in tort (1)Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Crown shall be subject to all those liabilities in tort to which, if it were a private person of full age and capacity, it would be subject:– (a)in respect of torts committed by its servants or agents; (b)in respect of any breach of those duties which a person owes to his servants or agents at common law by reason of being their employer; and (c)in respect of any breach of the duties attaching at common law to the ownership, occupation, possession or control of property: Provided that no proceedings shall lie against the Crown by virtue of paragraph (a) of this subsection in respect of any act or omission of a servant or agent of the Crown unless the act or omission would, apart from the provisions of this Act, have given rise to a cause of action in tort against that servant or agent or his estate.” 80.Members of the armed forces were to be treated differently. If they died or were injured in the course of their duties, the Crown could not be sued in tort once the Secretary of State certified that the death or injury would be treated as attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to a war pension. In particular, section 10 of the 1947 Act was entitled “Provisions relating to the armed forces” and provided as follows: “(1)Nothing done or omitted to be done by a member of the armed forces of the Crown while on duty as such shall subject either him or the Crown to liability in tort for causing the death of another person, or for causing personal injury to another person, in so far as the death or personal injury is due to anything suffered by that other person while he is a member of the armed forces of the Crown if– (a)at the time when that thing is suffered by that other person, he is either on duty as a member of the armed forces of the Crown or is, though not on duty as such, on any land, premises, ship, aircraft or vehicle for the time being used for the purposes of the armed forces of the Crown; and (b)the [Secretary of State] certifies that his suffering that thing has been or will be treated as attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to an award under the Royal Warrant, Order in Council or Order of His Majesty relating to the disablement or death of members of the force of which he is a member: Provided that this subsection shall not exempt a member of the said forces from liability in tort in any case in which the court is satisfied that the act or omission was not connected with the execution of his duties as a member of those forces. (2)No proceedings in tort shall lie against the Crown for death or personal injury due to anything suffered by a member of the armed forces of the Crown if– (a)that thing is suffered by him in consequence of the nature or condition of any such land, premises, ship, aircraft or vehicle as aforesaid, or in consequence of the nature or condition of any equipment or supplies used for the purposes of those forces; and (b)the [Secretary of State] certifies as mentioned in the preceding subsection; nor shall any act or omission of an officer of the Crown subject him to liability in tort for death or personal injury, in so far as the death or personal injury is due to anything suffered by a member of the armed forces of the Crown being a thing as to which the conditions aforesaid are satisfied. (3)... a Secretary of State, if satisfied that it is the fact:– (a)that a person was or was not on any particular occasion on duty as a member of the armed forces of the Crown; or (b)that at any particular time any land, premises, ship, aircraft, vehicle, equipment or supplies was or was not, or were or were not, used for the purposes of the said forces; may issue a certificate certifying that to be the fact; and any such certificate shall, for the purpose of this section, be conclusive as to the fact which it certifies.” The words in section 2 of the 1947 Act “subject to the provisions of this Act” rendered section 2 subject to the provisions of section 10 of the 1947Act. 81.The exception contained in section 10 of the 1947 Act was removed by the 1987 Act. This removal was not retrospective. Accordingly, after 1987 claims in tort by members of the armed forces (or their estates) who had died or been injured as a result of conduct that took place prior to 1987 could not proceed if the Secretary of State issued the relevant certificate. The reasons the law was prospective only were explained by the member of parliament introducing the bill as follows (Hansard, HC, 13February 1987, col. 572): “Successive Governments have resisted retrospective legislation as a basic concept, especially where such legislation imposes a retrospective liability on others. Secondly, it would be clearly wrong to impose retrospective liability on a serviceman for past actions, even if the Crown, his employer, were to stand behind him. That would involve individuals who are alleged to be guilty of negligence over the years being brought to book in a court of law for actions [for] which, at the time they were committed, they were not liable under the law. That is a strong argument against retrospective legislation. Thirdly, ... where should the line be drawn in dealing with past claims so as to be fair and just towards all claimants? How could there be a logical cut-off point for considering claims either by the [MOD] or the courts. How could those whose claims which fell on the wrong side of the arbitrary line be satisfied? How could the [MOD], and ultimately the courts, be expected to assess old cases where the necessary documentary evidence or witnesses are no longer available? Those are practical questions to which, sadly, there are no ready answers. For that reason, I believe that the only reasonable course of action is to legislate for the repeal of section 10 from the date of enactment.” 82.Section 11 of this Act provides that any action for damages for personal injury must be brought within three years of the cause of action arising. 83.Mr Matthews served in the Royal Navy between 1955 and 1968. In 2001 he brought proceedings in negligence against the MOD (alleging the MOD's negligence and breach of statutory duty and its vicarious liability for the negligence and breach of duty of his fellow servicemen) claiming that he had suffered personal injury as a result of his exposure to asbestos fibres and dust while performing his duties as a serviceman. 84.On the preliminary issue of whether the MOD could be sued under section 10 of the 1947 Act, the High Court found that provision to be incompatible with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. 85.In deciding whether section 10 amounted to a procedural or substantive limitation on his rights, the High Court considered that the issue turned on whether a section 10 certificate extinguished not only MrMatthews' right to sue for damages but also his primary right arising from the Crown's duty of care: “If, after the passing of the 1947 Act, he had the primary right not to be exposed to asbestos in circumstances amounting to negligence or breach of statutory duty, section10 merely extinguished his secondary right to claim damages for its breach, and that would amount merely to a procedural bar on his secondary right to claim his preferred remedy for breach of his primary right.” In concluding that section 10 amounted to a procedural bar to an existing right of action in tort and in thus finding Article 6 applicable, the High Court relied, in particular, on Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 10 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV) and Fogarty v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 37112/97, ECHR 2001-XI). 86.The limitation therefore had to be subjected to a proportionality test. In this respect, the High Court concluded that the disadvantages of a pension scheme were such that access to it was an “exceptionally, indeed an unacceptably” high price to pay for the advantage of not having to prove fault, an advantage that would only apply when the question of the fault of the other party was in doubt. Neither was the High Court convinced that the choice to repeal the 1947 Act prospectively was proportionate, considering, inter alia, that the finding of liability for conduct that was not a basis for liability when it took place was far less pernicious a solution than denying proper damages to persons injured as a result of negligence. 87.The Court of Appeal allowed the MOD's appeal. Section 10 had a substantive and not procedural effect and the High Court's reliance on Fogarty, cited above, was mistaken. The Master of the Rolls stated that: “The requirement in section 10 for a certificate from the Secretary of State as a precondition to defeating a claimant's cause of action is an unusual one and not easily analysed, and it cannot be treated simply as an option to impose a procedural bar on the claim.” 88.In so finding, the Court of Appeal rejected the MOD's objection, based on Pellegrin v. France ([GC], no. 28541/95, ECHR 1999VIII) and, more recently, R. v. Belgium (no. 33919/96, 27 February 2001), to the applicability of Article 6 § 1, the Court of Appeal finding that Pellegrin was concerned solely with “disputes raised by servants of the State over their conditions of service” whereas the proceedings before the Court of Appeal concerned the nature and effect of section 10 of the 1947 Act on a claim in tort against the MOD. 89.The applicant appealed, arguing that the Court of Appeal had ignored a clear principle established by Fogarty. The MOD did not pursue the Pellegrin argument. 90.The House of Lords (Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord Millett and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe) unanimously rejected the appeal. The House of Lords considered the maintenance of the distinction between procedural and substantive limitations on access to a court to be a necessary one since Article 6 was concerned with procedural fairness and the integrity of a State's judicial system rather than with the substantive content of its national law. However, the House of Lords acknowledged the difficulty in tracing the borderline between the substantive and procedural, considering the Convention jurisprudence to be indicative of some difficulty in this respect. Drawing on the text, historical context, legislative intent and the actual operation of section 10 of the 1947 Act and, further, on a comprehensive analysis of the Convention jurisprudence and applicable principles, the House of Lords concluded that section 10 of the 1947 Act maintained the existing lack of liability in tort of the Crown to service personnel for injury suffered that was attributable to service and served to ease servicemen towards the no-fault pension option by taking away the need to prove attributability. It amounted therefore to a substantive limitation on the liability of the Crown in tort to servicemen for service injury to which Article 6 § 1 did not apply. 91.Having reviewed the Convention jurisprudence, Lord Bingham noted that, whatever the difficulty in tracing the dividing line between procedural and substantive limitations of a given entitlement under domestic law, an accurate analysis of a claimant's substantive rights in domestic law was, nonetheless, an essential first step towards deciding whether he had, for the purposes of the autonomous meaning given to the expression by the Convention, a “civil right” such as would engage Article 6. Lord Bingham went on to outline the historical evolution of section 10, considering it clear that there was no parliamentary intention to confer any substantive right to claim damages. “Few common-law rules were better-established or more unqualified”, he began, “than that which precluded any claim in tort against the Crown” and because “there was no wrong of which a claimant could complain (because the King could do no wrong) relief by petition of right was not available”. Claims referred to as “exempted claims” against the Crown for damages for, inter alia, injury sustained by armed forces personnel while on duty were “absolutely barred”. When proposals for reform were put forward in the 1920s, “no cause of action was proposed in relation to the exempted claims”. When the Crown Proceedings Bill was introduced into Parliament in 1947 it again provided that the exempted claims should be “absolutely barred”, but those fulfilling the qualifying condition would be compensated by the award of a pension on a no-fault basis. When what was to become section 10(1) was amended uncontentiously in the House of Commons, the intention was not to alter the “essential thrust of the provision as previously drafted”. The object of the new certification procedure was to “ease the path of those denied any right to a common-law claim towards obtaining a pension, by obviating the need to prove attributability, an essential qualifying condition for the award of a pension”. Whereas the issue of a certificate under section 10(3) of the 1947 Act was discretionary as shown by the permissive “may”, no such permissive language applied to the issuance of a certificate under section 10(1)(b). “It was plainly intended that, where the conditions were met, the Secretary of State should issue a certificate as was the invariable practice of successive Secretaries of State over the next forty years.” Although different language had been used over the years, “the English courts had consistently regarded section 10(1) as precluding any claim at common law”. It was in fact the “absolute nature of the exclusion imposed by section 10(1)” (coupled with the discrepancy, by 1987, between the value of a pension and of a claim for common-law damages) which fuelled the demand for the revocation of section 10 and led to the 1987 Act. In deciding whether section 10(1) imposed a procedural bar or denied any substantive right, regard had to be had to the practical realities and, in that respect, the Secretary of State's practice had been “uniform and unvarying” so that any practitioner would have advised Mr Matthews that a section 10 certificate was “bound to be issued”. Lord Bingham found Fogarty to be “categorically different” from Matthews and concluded, for reasons closely reflecting those of the Court of Appeal and of Lord Walker (see below), that the appeal was to be rejected. 92.As regards the distinction between substantive and procedural bars to a judicial remedy, Lord Walker conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Convention jurisprudence, highlighting what he considered to be inconsistencies and the difficulties in applying it: “127.The distinction between substantive and procedural bars to a judicial remedy has often been referred to in the jurisprudence on Article 6 § 1, but the cases do not speak with a single clear voice. That is hardly surprising. The distinction, although easy to grasp in extreme cases, becomes much more debatable close to the borderline, especially as different legal systems draw the line in different places ... ... 130.I have already referred to several of the most important cases, but it is useful to see how two contrasting themes have developed since the seminal Golder decision in 1975. Some cases emphasise the importance of avoiding any arbitrary or disproportionate restriction on a litigant's access to the court, whether or not the restriction should be classified as procedural in nature. Others attach importance to the distinction between substance and procedure. 131.The first case to note is Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom ... Section 141(1) [of the Mental Health Act 1959] imposed substantive restrictions on his rights of action (requiring bad faith or negligence) and subsection (2) imposed a procedural restriction (the need for the Court's permission for the commencement of proceedings). The Commission ... agreed with the parties that 'it is immaterial whether the measure is of a substantive or procedural character. It suffices to say that section141 acted as an unwaivable bar, which effectively restricted the applicant's claim in tort'. But the Commission considered that the restrictions were not arbitrary or unreasonable, being intended to protect hospital staff from ill-founded or vexatious litigation. The Court ... took a similar view. 132.In Pinder v. the United Kingdom ... (from which Ketterick and Dyer are not significantly different) the Commission took the view ... that section 10 of the 1947 Act brought about the substitution of a no-fault system of pension entitlement for the right to sue for damages, and that that removed the claimant's civil right: 'It follows, therefore, that the State does not bear the burden of justifying an immunity from liability which forms part of its civil law with reference to “a pressing social need” as contended by the applicant.' However the Commission then ... referred to its report in Ashingdane and stated: 'These principles apply not only in respect of procedural limitations such as the removal of the jurisdiction of the court, as in the Ashingdane case, but also in respect of a substantive immunity from liability as in the present case. The question, therefore, arises in the present context, whether section 10 of the 1947 Act constitutes an arbitrary limitation of the applicant's substantive civil claims.' 133.The Commission held that section 10 was not arbitrary or disproportionate ... 134.Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom ... was concerned with the effect of section 76(1) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 on persons complaining of noise from aircraft travelling to and from . Section 76(1) excludes liability for any action in trespass or nuisance so long as the height of the aircraft was reasonable in all the circumstances, and its flight was not in breach of the provisions of the Act or any order made under it. In unanimously rejecting the claimants' claim under Article 6 § 1 the European Court of Human Rights simply relied on the fact that the applicants had no substantive right to relief under English law. It rejected a subsidiary argument that the claimants' residuary entitlement to sue (in cases not excluded by section 6(1)) was illusory. 135.The Court's approach in Fayed v. the United Kingdom ... was much less straightforward. ... The Court's discussion of the relevant principles contained ... the following passage ...: 'Whether a person has an actionable domestic claim may depend not only on the substantive content, properly speaking, of the relevant civil right as defined under national law but also on the existence of procedural bars preventing or limiting the possibilities of bringing potential claims to court. In the latter kind of case Article 6 § 1 may have a degree of applicability. Certainly the Convention enforcement bodies may not create by way of interpretation of Article 6 § 1 a substantive civil right which has no legal basis in the State concerned. However, it would not be consistent with the rule of law in a democratic society or with the basic principle underlying Article 6 § 1 – namely that civil claims must be capable of being submitted to a judge for adjudication – if, for example, a State could, without restraint or control by the Convention enforcement bodies, remove from the jurisdiction of the courts a whole range of civil claims or confer immunities from civil liability on large groups or categories of persons.' 136.It is hard to tell how far the last sentence of this passage goes. The Court then referred ... to the distinction between substantive and procedural restrictions: 'It is not always an easy matter to trace the dividing line between procedural and substantive limitations of a given entitlement under domestic law. It may sometimes be no more than a question of legislative technique whether the limitation is expressed in terms of the right or its remedy.' The Court did not go any further in attempting to resolve this problem on the ground that it might in any case have had to consider issues of legitimate aim and proportionality for the purposes of Article 8 (respect for private life), even though there was in fact no complaint under Article 8. 137.In Stubbings v. the United Kingdom ... and Tinnelly & Sons Ltd v. the United Kingdom ..., the Court considered whether restrictions on access to the court (in section 2 of the Limitation Act 1980 and section 42 of the Fair Employment () Act 1976 respectively) were justifiable without adverting expressly to the distinction between substantive and procedural bars. In Waite and Kennedy v. ..., the Commission ... described the immunity as merely a procedural bar, and as such requiring justification. The Court took the same view, regarding ... the claimants' access to some unspecified procedures for alternative dispute resolution as being a material factor. 138.The two most recent cases are of particular importance. In Z [and Others] v. the United Kingdom ..., the Court ... held that there had been no breach of Article 6 § 1 in your Lordships' decision in X v. Bedfordshire County Council [1995] 2 AC 633 as to the responsibility of a local authority for children who had suffered neglect and abuse over a period of five years while their suffering was known to the local authority (but they were not the subject of any care order). ... The whole of the Court's judgment on Article 6 § 1 ... merits careful study, but its essence appears from the following passages ...: ... 'The Court is led to the conclusion that the inability of the applicants to sue the local authority flowed not from an immunity but from the applicable principles governing the substantive right of action in domestic law. There was no restriction on access to court of the kind contemplated in the Ashingdane judgment.' In reaching these conclusions the majority of the Court stated in plain terms that its decision in Osman had been based on a misunderstanding of the English law of negligence. 139.Finally there is Fogarty v. the United Kingdom ... That case was decided about six months after Z and by a constitution of the Court several of whose members had sat (and some of whom had dissented) in Z. In Fogarty the Court repeated verbatim ... the passage from Fayed which I have already quoted. It rejected ... the United Kingdom's argument that because of the operation of State immunity the claimant did not have a substantive right under domestic law. The Court attached importance to the United States' ability to waive (in fact the judgment said 'not choose to claim') immunity as indicating that the bar was procedural. Nevertheless, the Court concluded ... that: 'measures taken by a High Contracting Party which reflect generally recognised rules of public international law on State immunity cannot in principle be regarded as imposing a disproportionate restriction on the right of access to court as embodied in Article 6 § 1. Just as the right of access to court is an inherent part of the fair trial guarantee in that Article, so some restrictions on access must likewise be regarded as inherent, an example being those limitations generally accepted by the community of nations as part of the doctrine of State immunity.' 140.In trying to reconcile the inconsistencies in the jurisprudence it might be tempting to suppose that the Court's wide and rather speculative observations in Fayed (which were not its grounds for decision) marked a diversion which proved, in Z, to be a blind alley. But that explanation immediately runs into the difficulty that in Fogarty, six months after Z, the Court (constituted by many of the same judges) chose to repeat, word for word, the observations made in Fayed. The uncertain shadow of Osman still lies over this area of the law. 141.Nevertheless [Mr Matthews' counsel] conceded that in order to succeed on the appeal, he had to satisfy your Lordships that section 10 of the 1947 Act constituted a procedural bar. He equated this task with satisfying your Lordships that Mr Matthews had at the commencement of his proceedings a cause of action against the [MOD], and that that cause of action was cut off (or defeated) by the [MOD's] invocation of the section 10 procedure. He treated this event as indistinguishable from the government's invocation, in Fogarty, of the defence of State immunity (to be precise, its decision not to waive State immunity). In each case, [Mr Matthews' counsel] argued, the defendant was relying on a procedural bar to defeat a substantive claim which was valid when proceedings were commenced. 142.In my view, [Mr Matthews' counsel's] concession was rightly made. Although there are difficulties in defining the borderline between substance and procedure, the general nature of the distinction is clear in principle, and it is also clear that Article 6 is, in principle, concerned with the procedural fairness and integrity of a State's judicial system, not with the substantive content of its national law. The notion that a State should decide to substitute a no-fault system of compensation for some injuries which might otherwise lead to claims in tort is not inimical to Article 6 § 1, as the Commission said in Dyer ... (in a report, specifically dealing with section 10 of the 1947 Act, which has been referred to with approval by the Court in several later cases). 143.In the circumstances [Mr Matthews'] argument clings ever more closely to the bare fact that Mr Matthews had a cause of action when he issued his claim form, and that his claim could not be struck out as hopeless unless and until the Secretary of State issued a certificate under section 10. But European human rights law is concerned, not with superficial appearances or verbal formulae, but with the realities of the situation (Van Droogenbroeck v. ...). [Mr Matthews'] argument does, with respect, ignore the realities of the situation. It is common ground that the Secretary of State does in practice issue a certificate whenever it is (in legal and practical terms) appropriate to do so. He does not have a wide discretion comparable to that of a foreign government in deciding whether or not to waive State immunity (which may be by no means a foregone conclusion, especially in politically sensitive employment cases). The decision whether or not to waive immunity in Fogarty really was a decision about a procedural bar, but I am quite unpersuaded that it provides a parallel with this case. The fact is that section 10 of the 1947 Act did in very many cases before 1987, and still does in cases of latent injury sustained before 1987, substitute a no-fault system of compensation for a claim for damages. This was and is a matter of substantive law and the provision for an official certificate (in order to avoid or at least minimise the risk of inconsistent decisions on causation) does not alter that. Section 10(1)(b), taken on its own, is a provision for the protection of persons with claims against the [MOD]. I respectfully agree with Lord Bingham's analysis of the legislative history of the 1947 Act and with the conclusions which he draws from it. 144.In these circumstances I do not consider it necessary or desirable to attempt to assess whether section 10, if tested as a procedural bar, would meet the test of proportionality. There would be serious arguments either way and as it is not necessary to express a view I prefer not to do so.” 93.Lord Hoffmann agreed with Lord Walker's reasoning and conclusions and made certain additional observations. He noted that Mr Matthews' counsel (also counsel for the present applicant) had conceded that, if the 1947 Act simply said that servicemen had no right of action, it would not have infringed Article 6. Mr Matthews argued, however, that the structure of the 1947 Act was such that he had a civil right (a cause of action in tort) until a section 10 certificate was issued; if no certificate had been issued he would have been able to prosecute his action before the courts; and section10 therefore gave the Secretary of State a power at his discretion to cut off the applicant's action and prevent him from bringing it before the courts. Lord Hoffmann pointed out that, if the purpose of section 10(1)(b) and (2)(b) had been to give the Secretary of State a discretionary power “to swoop down and prevent people with claims against the Crown from bringing them before the courts”, he would have agreed since such executive interference would run counter to the rule of law and the principle of the separation of powers. However, referring to the historical analysis of Lord Bingham, he considered it clear that section 10 delimited the substantive cause of action and the section 10 certificate was no more than a binding acknowledgment by the Secretary of State of the “attributable to service” requirement for an award of a pension, the quid pro quo for the inability to sue in tort. He too considered distinguishable Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others (Matthews did not involve any encroachment by the executive upon the functions of the judicial branch) and Fogarty (having regard to the discretion available to the foreign government to submit or not to jurisdiction). 94.Lord Hope analysed in some detail the Convention jurisprudence and principles, the history of the 1947 Act, the text and operation of section10 and the section 10 certification process. He noted: “72.The overall context is provided by the fact that section 10 falls within the same Part [I] of the Act as section 2. Section 2, by which the basic rules for the Crown's liability in tort are laid down, is expressed to be 'subject to the provisions of this Act'. Section 10 is an integral part of the overall scheme of liability which is described in Part I of the Act. This was all new law. None of the provisions in this Part which preserved the Crown's immunity from suit in particular cases could be said, when the legislation was enacted, to be removing from anybody a right to claim which he previously enjoyed. 73.As for section 10 itself, ... [i]t proceeds on the assumption that if a claim is made under section 2 of the Act the Secretary of State will have to form a view, on the facts, as to whether or not the case is covered by the immunity. The Secretary of State is told that he cannot have it both ways. He is not allowed to assert the immunity without making a statement in the form of a certificate in the terms which the condition lays down. This has the effect of preventing him, as the minister responsible for the administration of the war pension scheme, from contesting the issue whether the suffering of the thing was attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to an award under that scheme. This is a matter of substantive law. It is an essential part of the overall scheme for the reform of the law which the 1947 Act laid down. It does not take anything away from the claimant which he had before. On the contrary, it has been inserted into the scheme of the Act for his benefit.” Lord Hope concluded, in full agreement with the reasons expressed by Lord Walker, that section 10 amounted to a substantive limitation on the right to sue the Crown in tort. 95.Lord Millett's judgment also contained a comprehensive assessment of the Court's jurisprudence, the historical context and text of section 10 and the consequent purpose of the section 10 certificate. He noted: “If the serviceman brought proceedings against the Crown for damages, the question at once arose whether his injury was sustained in circumstances which qualified him for a pension, for if it was the Crown was not liable in damages. Sometimes the Secretary of State had already conceded, or the Tribunal had already found, that whatever the serviceman claimed to be the cause of his injury was attributable to service in the armed forces of the Crown. If so he would grant a certificate to that effect and the action would be struck out on the ground that it disclosed no cause of action. ... In such circumstances the Secretary of State had no discretion whether to grant or withhold a certificate. He was called on to certify an existing state of facts which prevented the proceedings from having any chance of success. It was his duty as a public servant to ascertain the facts and certify or not accordingly.” Lord Millett considered it plain that the section 10 certificate did not operate as a procedural bar to prevent the serviceman from having his civil right judicially determined. As regards Fogarty, and unlike the other Law Lords, he considered that immunities claimed by a State which conformed to generally accepted norms of international law fell outside Article 6 entirely. For the reasons outlined by each of their Lordships with which he agreed, he would also dismiss the appeal. 96.The scheme currently in force for the payment of a service pension in respect of, inter alia, illnesses and injuries attributable to service is contained in the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983 (“the Pensions Order”). 97.The basic condition for the award of a pension is that “the disablement or death of a member of the armed forces is due to service” (Article 3 of the Pensions Order). “Disablement” is defined as “physical or mental injury or damage, or loss of physical or mental capacity” (Schedule4 to the Pensions Order). Where claims are made more than seven years after the termination of service, Article 5(1)(a) provides that the disablement or death is to be treated as “due to service” if it is due to an injury which is either attributable to service after 2 September 1939 or existed before or arose during such service and was and continues to be aggravated by it. 98.The Pensions Order provides that where, upon reliable evidence, a reasonable doubt exists whether the above conditions are fulfilled, the benefit of that doubt must be given to the claimant (Article 5(4)). 99.The scheme for the payment of pensions is administered by a specialised agency of the DSS, formerly the War Pensions Agency (“WPA”) and now the Veterans Agency (“VA”). On receipt of an application, the VA, inter alia, obtains the claimant's service records (including service medical records) from the MOD and, with the assistance of additional medical evidence if required, assesses whether the claimant is suffering from a disability attributable to service. The Secretary of State decides on the basis of this assessment whether to award a service pension. 100.A claimant who is refused a war pension by the Secretary of State may appeal to the PAT (see the Pensions Appeal Tribunals Act 1943) in accordance with the PAT Rules. This body is composed of a lawyer, a doctor and a serviceman or ex-serviceman of the same sex and rank as the claimant. 101.The VA provides the PAT with a Statement of Case, which includes, inter alia, a transcript of the claimant's service records including service medical records, civilian medical records and reports including those prepared at the request of the VA and a statement outlining the Secretary of State's reasons for refusing the application. The claimant may submit an answer to the Statement of Case and/or adduce further evidence. A hearing then takes place. The PAT examination is de novo so that the appellant does not have to show that the Secretary of State's decision was wrong. A further appeal lies to the High Court on a point of law with leave from the PAT or the High Court. 102.Rule 6 of the PAT Rules (“the Rule 6 procedure”) is entitled “Disclosure of official documents and information” and provides as follows: “(1)Where for the purposes of his appeal an appellant desires to have disclosed any document, or part of any document, which he has reason to believe is in the possession of a government department, he may, at any time not later than six weeks after the Statement of Case was sent to him, apply to the President for the disclosure of the document or part and, if the President considers that the document or part is likely to be relevant to any issue to be determined on the appeal, he may give a direction to the department concerned requiring its disclosure (if in the possession of the department) in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the President may think fit: ... (2)On receipt of a direction given by the President under this rule, the Secretary of State or Minister in charge of the government department concerned, or any person authorised by him in that behalf, may certify to the President – (a)that it would be contrary to the public interest for the whole or part of the document to which the direction relates to be disclosed publicly; or (b)that the whole or part of the document ought not, for reasons of security, to be disclosed in any manner whatsoever; and where a certificate is given under sub-paragraph (a), the President shall give such directions to the tribunal as may be requisite for prohibiting or restricting the disclosure in public of the document, or part thereof, as the case may be, and where a certificate is given under sub-paragraph (b) the President shall direct the tribunal to consider whether the appellant's case will be prejudiced if the appeal proceeds without such disclosure, and, where the tribunal are of the opinion that the appellant would be prejudiced if the appeal were to proceed without such disclosure, they shall adjourn the hearing of the appeal until such time as the necessity for non-disclosure on the ground of security no longer exists.” 103.Prior to 1991 all medical records (civilian or service) were only disclosed on a “medical in confidence” basis. It was a matter for the doctor to decide if it was in the patient's best interests to see his or her records. The 1990 Act came into force on 1 November 1991 and it sets down the rights of persons to access, inter alia, their service and civilian medical records. It applies only to records compiled after the date of its entry into force and to records compiled “in connection with the care of the applicant”.",2005,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

107,001-58322,Grand Chamber,"9.On 3 May 1982 the applicant was arrested by the militia because he had taken part in a street demonstration in Gdańsk. Subsequently, he was detained on remand on suspicion of having participated in an illegal assembly. On 5 January 1983 the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) convicted the applicant of participating in an illegal assembly constituting a violent attack against third persons and public property (an offence outlawed by section 275 § 1 of the Criminal Code of 1969) and sentenced him, under martial law as then in force, to sixteen months' imprisonment. The court of first instance found, inter alia, that the applicant, while participating in the demonstration (commemorating the anniversary of the Constitution of 3 May 1791) had shouted anti-government slogans and hurled insults at the militia officers; had unfurled the national flag on a monument; and, when the militia forces had attempted to put down the demonstration, had thrown stones at them from the street barricades, thus destroying public property (i.e. militia vans and park benches). On 8 June 1983 the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) upheld the first-instance judgment. 10.On 3 March 1993 a panel of seven judges, sitting as the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court, on an extraordinary appeal filed by the Prosecutor General (Prokurator Generalny), quashed both the above-mentioned judgments and acquitted the applicant, finding that he had not committed any offence but had merely exercised his fundamental civil liberties as ""he had taken part in a peaceful and patriotic demonstration"". On this last point, the Supreme Court stressed that there was no doubt that the demonstration, regardless of whether it had been “legal” or “illegal” under the law as then in force, had not been intended to be a “violent attack against third persons or property”. Moreover, the violent clash between the demonstrators and the militia forces had been a simple consequence of and an inevitable response to the brutal attack by the latter on the demonstrators with, inter alia, truncheons, tear-gas bombs and water-cannons. 11.On 13 April 1993 the applicant lodged a request based on section 487 of the Code of Criminal Procedure with the Gdańsk Regional Court. He sought compensation from the State Treasury for his wrongful conviction in 1983 and his unjustified detention which had lasted 249 days in all. He requested the court to award him an unspecified sum in damages for loss of earnings, injuries allegedly sustained by him in the course of his detention and damage to his health resulting from imprisonment. At the material time the applicant was detained in Kwidzyń Prison where he was serving a sentence imposed in other criminal proceedings. 12.On 21 May 1993 the Chief Justice of the Gdańsk Regional Court informed the applicant that the above request had been referred to Criminal Division IV of that court on 18 May 1993. 13.In a letter of 7 June 1993 the applicant requested the court to inform him of the progress of the proceedings. 14.On 15 June 1993 the Gdańsk Regional Court ordered the applicant to specify the amount of the damages sought by him and to produce documents relating to the injuries sustained by him during his detention. The applicant specified the amount of the damages in a pleading filed with the court’s registry on 25 June 1993. 15.On 19 July 1993 the applicant requested the court to deal with his request as soon as possible. On 30 July 1993 the court informed him that it was dealing with requests for compensation submitted in the first six months of 1992. The applicant's attention was drawn to the fact that he had failed to submit the documents requested on 15 June 1993. The applicant produced the documents in question on an unspecified date in September 1993 and requested the court to list a hearing. 16.On 10 August 1993 the applicant complained to the Ombudsman (Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich), the Minister of Justice and the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) about the slow conduct of the proceedings in his case. On an unspecified date his complaints were referred to the Chief Justice of the Gdańsk Regional Court, who replied thereto on 6 November 1993. The Chief Justice informed the applicant that there were 28 similar compensation cases registered with the Criminal Division of that court and that the applicant’s case was the twentieth on the list. As a consequence, it was difficult to foresee precisely when a hearing in his case would be held. 17.On 26 October 1993 the applicant complained to the Supreme Court about the length of the proceedings in his case. On 9 November 1993 his complaint was referred to the Gdańsk Court of Appeal which, on 23December 1993, informed the applicant that his case was currently the sixteenth on the list and that it would probably be dealt with in the first three months of 1994. 18.In the meantime, on 10 November 1993, the applicant had submitted a pleading to the Gdańsk Regional Court, increasing his claims. In particular, he requested the court to order the State to pay him in addition a monthly amount to compensate him for loss of opportunities. He also informed the court that he was unable to produce any documents relating to the injuries sustained by him during detention since his medical records of 1982 were kept in the prison archives and they could be disclosed only upon the court’s order. On 25 November 1993 the court ordered the competent prison authorities to produce the relevant documents; they were filed with the court on 7 December 1993. On the same day the applicant requested the court to list a hearing. 19.In a pleading filed with the court’s registry on 29 December 1993 the applicant increased his claims to an unspecified sum. 20.On 5 January 1994 the Gdańsk Regional Court, in reply to a subsequent complaint from the applicant, informed him that it was still dealing with other requests for compensation submitted prior to his. The court stated, however, that a hearing in his case would be listed as soon as possible. 21.On 24 January 1994 the applicant again complained to the Gdańsk Regional Court about the excessive length of the proceedings. In a letter of 8 February 1994 the court informed him that it was not feasible to list a hearing for any date in the first three months of 1994. 22.On 14 February 1994 the applicant complained to the Chief Justice of the Gdańsk Regional Court about the length of the proceedings and asked him when the first hearing would be held. On 23 March 1994 the Chief Justice informed the applicant that his case would probably be dealt with in June or July 1994. He also admitted that, on account of substantial delays in dealing with similar requests for compensation, previous indications as to a possible hearing date appeared to have been inaccurate. 23.On 28 March 1994 the applicant complained to the Minister of Justice about inactivity on the part of the Gdańsk Regional Court. 24.On 1 June 1994 the Gdańsk Regional Court listed the first hearing in the applicant's case for 17 June 1994. During the hearing the court took evidence from the applicant who stated, inter alia, that in 1982 he had conducted a business activity and had been a member of the Gdańsk Trade Guild. The court adjourned the trial sine die since it found that evidence needed to be obtained from medical experts in order to assess whether there was a causal link between the state of the applicant's health and the detention imposed in 1982-83. The court also considered it necessary to hear evidence from the applicant’s sister and to call for documentary evidence of financial loss (if any) sustained by the applicant as a result of his conviction and the deprivation of his liberty. 25.On 20 June 1994 the court ordered that the following documentary evidence be obtained: firstly, the applicant’s updated medical records from the relevant prison authorities; secondly, written information from the competent tax office as to whether the applicant had paid any tax on his income for April and May 1982; thirdly, a certificate from the applicant’s former employer stating the applicant’s average monthly salary over the period preceding his detention (i.e. from 29 October 1981 to 31 March 1982) and, fourthly, written information from the Gdańsk Trade Guild on whether the applicant had been a member of the guild and had paid membership fees. 26.On 27 June 1994 the court received the applicant’s medical records. On 21 July 1994 the tax office informed the court that the applicant had not been registered as a taxpayer conducting business activities in 1982. Since the company by which the applicant had formerly been employed had failed to produce the certificate requested, the court issued two reminders to it, on 19 July and 1 September 1994. On 15 December 1994 the applicant’s employer provided the court with the certificate in question. 27.Meanwhile, in a letter of 25 July 1994, the applicant had asked the trial court when the proceedings would be terminated. On 8 August 1994 the court informed him that procedural steps had been taken to obtain the evidence relevant for the determination of his claims. 28.On 3 and 24 October 1994 the applicant complained to the Chief Justice of the Gdańsk Regional Court about the length of the proceedings. On 25 October 1994 the Chief Justice informed the applicant that on 20October 1994 the case-file had been sent to experts at the Faculty of Forensic Medicine of the Gdańsk Academy of Medicine. Therefore, the date of the next hearing could not be fixed until the experts had submitted their report. 29.On 18 November 1994 the court, after finding that the experts had not fixed a date for the applicant to be examined, ordered that the registry supervise the experts’ work and report to the presiding judge on the progress of the process of obtaining evidence. 30.On 1 December 1994 the applicant was examined by a neurologist who expressed the opinion that he should also undergo a brain tomography examination. The Faculty of Radiology of the Gdańsk Academy of Medicine, at the court’s request, fixed the date of the examination for 22December 1994. 31.In the meantime, on 19 December 1994, the applicant had been granted twenty-four hours' leave from prison and had failed to return. He did not keep his appointment for the brain tomography examination. 32.On 13 January 1995 the Gdańsk Regional Court stayed the proceedings, after being informed by the prison authorities that the applicant was still being searched for. On 17 February 1995 the court resumed the proceedings as the applicant had informed it that service of a summons or other court documents on him could be effected at his home address. Subsequently the court requested the experts to fix another date for the brain tomography examination. The examination was to be carried out on 24April 1995 and the court ordered that on that day the applicant, who had in the meantime been redetained, be taken from prison to the experts. 33.However, on 11 April 1995, the Chief Justice of the Gdańsk Regional Court informed the President of the Criminal Division of that court that the applicant, in his two letters dated 3 April 1995, had refused to consent to the brain tomography examination and had threatened to go on hunger strike in order to obtain a date for the next hearing. 34.On 4 May 1995 the trial court informed the experts that the applicant was unwilling to undergo the brain tomography examination and asked them whether they would be able to prepare their report on the basis of the materials contained in the case file. The experts submitted their report to the court on 23 May 1995. 35.On 23 May 1995 the court again requested the Gdańsk Trade Guild to submit information on whether the applicant had been a member of the guild in April and May 1982. On 25 May 1995 the court was informed, by telephone, that the applicant had not been a member of the guild from 1980 to 1995. Later, on 30 May 1995, the court established on the basis of unspecified evidence that the applicant, even though he had previously alleged that he had commenced his business activity in 1982, had in fact registered his business with the relevant authorities on 1 August 1990. 36.On 2 June 1995 the Gdańsk Regional Court held a hearing and heard evidence from the applicant’s sister. During the hearing the applicant confirmed that he was unwilling to undergo the brain tomography examination. On the same day the court pronounced a decision granting the applicant's claims in part. It awarded him the sum of 5,000 Polish zlotys (PLN), of which PLN 2,500 was for pecuniary damage and PLN 2,500 for non-pecuniary damage. 37.On 5 July 1995, on the applicant's appeal of 9 June 1995, the Gdańsk Court of Appeal quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case to the Gdańsk Regional Court, finding, in particular, that the lower court had failed to establish properly a causal link between the state of the applicant’s health and his detention. In the meantime, on 26 June 1995, the applicant had requested the court to terminate the proceedings as soon as possible. 38.On 17 July 1995 the Gdańsk Regional Court ordered that a fresh report be obtained from the neurologist who had prepared the previous report. 39.In his pleading of 19 July 1995 the applicant increased his claims to an unspecified sum. 40.On 17 August 1995 the applicant complained to the court that the length of the proceedings in his case was excessive. On 23 August 1995 the court informed him that the next hearing would be listed after obtaining the report from the expert. 41.On 28 August 1995 the expert informed the court that he was unable to prepare a more extensive report on the applicant’s state of health without the help of the brain tomography examination. 42.In a letter of 12 September 1995, received at the court’s registry on 25 September 1995, the applicant requested the court to proceed with his case. 43.On 11 October 1995 the court held a hearing and heard evidence from the expert. The trial was adjourned since the court decided that evidence should be heard from two witnesses, namely K.D., a doctor, and A.P., the prosecutor who had detained the applicant on remand in May 1982. Until 14 December 1995 the court was unable to establish the address of (and thus to serve a summons on) A.P. 44.On 12 January 1996 the court held the next hearing and heard evidence from K.D.; however, the trial was adjourned to 9 February 1996 since A.P. had failed to appear before the court. On 9 February 1996 the trial was again adjourned for the same reason. During a subsequent hearing, which was held on 6 March 1996 in the applicant’s presence, the court heard evidence from A.P. and pronounced a decision granting the applicant compensation in the sum of PLN 6,800 for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. The full text of the decision was served on the applicant on 18March 1996. Since he did not appeal against it within the statutory time-limit of seven days, the decision became final and enforceable on 26 March 1996. On 1October 1996 the applicant went to the Financial Department of the Gdańsk Regional Court and received the sum awarded, in cash. 45.At the material time the domestic provisions setting out the State’s liability for wrongful conviction or for unjustifiably depriving an individual of his liberty in the course of criminal proceedings against him were contained in Chapter 50 of the Polish Code of Criminal Procedure of 1969, entitled ""Compensation for unjustified conviction, detention on remand or arrest"". The Code is no longer in force as it was repealed and replaced by the Code of Criminal Procedure of 6 June 1997, currently referred to as the “New Code of Criminal Procedure”. 46.Section 487 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1969 provided, insofar as relevant: ""1. An accused who, as a result of the reopening of the criminal proceedings against him or of lodging an extraordinary appeal, has been acquitted or resentenced under a more lenient substantive provision, shall be entitled to compensation from the State Treasury for the damage which he has suffered in consequence of having served the whole or a part of the sentence imposed on him. ...> The provisions of the present chapter shall be applied by analogy to manifestly unjustified arrest or detention on remand."" 47.Section 488 of that Code provided, insofar as relevant: ""1. A request for compensation shall be submitted to a regional court in whose jurisdiction the decision giving rise to the request for compensation was given at first instance. ...> The court shall consist of three judges. Cases relating to requests for compensation shall be given priority and no court fees shall be required from the applicant."" 48.A request for compensation based on the foregoing provisions was examined by a criminal court. In those proceedings the court applied the rules of criminal procedure; however, in respect of such questions as the evaluation of the pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage sustained by an accused, the court applied the relevant principles set out in the Civil Code. The person concerned was entitled to compensation for any financial loss (e.g. loss of work or earnings), damage to health and psychological harm resulting from the execution of the sentence or detention on remand. In order to determine the amount of the damages due for loss of work or earnings the court was obliged to establish the earning capacity which the applicant would have had if he had not been convicted and detained and to deduct from the sum so determined his necessary everyday expenses and, if appropriate, other spending or losses (see the decision of the Supreme Court of 19 April 1995, no. WZ 71/95, published in OSP 1995/12/235). 49.The court primarily applied the rules of evidence contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, according to well-established legal theory and practice, the court also applied the relevant rules of civil procedure. In particular, since the main issue involved in such proceedings was financial reparation for a miscarriage of justice, and not the determination of any criminal charge, the court applied a general principle of civil procedure that the burden of producing evidence and the burden of proof lay on the claimant. 50.In such matters as the admissibility and assessment of evidence the court essentially applied the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, providing, in particular, that the court could admit evidence either of its own motion or at the parties’ request and assess it on the basis of its own conviction. However, in cases where it was impossible or difficult to establish with precision the facts relevant for the determination of the damages due for loss of work or earnings (such as the earning capacity of the applicant, his income and expenses), the court was required, applying by analogy section 322 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to fix the amount of such damages on the basis of its own assessment of all the relevant circumstances (see the resolution reached by the Plenary Supreme Court on 7 June 1958, no. Prez. 729/58, published in OSN 1958, no. 4, item 34) 51.Under Section 10 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure organs conducting criminal proceedings were, if necessary, obliged to inform the parties to the proceedings of their procedural rights and duties.",1999,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

59,001-101739,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Angleur. 10.On 17 October 2003 the applicant appeared before the Liège Assize Court, together with seven co-defendants, on charges of murdering an honorary minister (ministre d’Etat), A.C., and attempting to murder the latter’s partner, M.-H.J. According to the wording of the indictment, they were charged with the following offences, committed in Liège on 18 July 1991: “as principals or joint principals, either through having perpetrated the offences or having directly cooperated in their perpetration, or through having, by any act whatsoever, lent such assistance to their perpetration that without it the offences could not have been committed, or through having, by gifts, promises, threats, abuse of authority or power, scheming or contrivance, directly incited another to commit the offences, or through having, by means of speeches in a public place or assembly, or by means of any written or printed matter, image or emblem displayed, distributed or sold, offered for sale or exhibited in a place where it could be seen by the public, directly incited another to commit the offences,>having knowingly and intentionally killed [A.C.], with the additional circumstance that the killing was premeditated, an offence classified by law as premeditated murder [assassinat];>having attempted, knowingly, intentionally and with premeditation, to kill [M.H.J.], the intent to commit the offence having been manifested by conduct which objectively constituted the first step towards perpetration of the offence and which was halted or failed to attain the aim pursued only as a result of circumstances outside the control of the perpetrators, an offence classified by law as attempted premeditated murder.” 11.Only one of the co-defendants filed a statement of defence. The applicant alleged that it was impossible for him to do so since he had no knowledge of the evidence against him. 12.The indictment of 12 August 2003 stated, inter alia, that in June 1996 a person described by the applicant as an anonymous witness had passed on certain information to the investigators. A record of 3 September 1996 noted the informer’s wish to remain anonymous, based on fears for his safety “in view of the importance of his information and the media outcry that has always surrounded the [A.C.] case”. The person was never interviewed by the investigating judge. He had given the investigators information obtained in confidence from a person whose identity he refused to disclose. During the trial in the Assize Court, questions were put to the investigators on the initiative of several of the defendants about the informer’s identity. The investigators stated that their informer was not one of the defendants and had not personally witnessed the alleged offences. According to the information supplied, which was set out in fifteen points, A.C.’s murder had been planned by six people, including the applicant and another leading politician. The passage incriminating the applicant stated: “V. der B. and Taxquet were said to have been particularly insistent about the urgent need to kill [A.C.] before the ‘91 holidays as he had promised to make some significant disclosures after the summer break.” 13.On account of the numerous applications made during the trial, the Assize Court delivered thirteen interlocutory judgments: (i)judgment of 17 October 2003 noting the absence of certain defendants and directing that they were to be tried in absentia; (ii)judgment of 20 October 2003 on an application to have a confrontation between witnesses declared null and void; (iii)judgment of 27 October 2003 concerning the examination of witnesses without one of the co-defendants being present; (iv)judgment of 3 November 2003 on the examination of a witness in camera; (v)judgment of 6 November 2003 setting aside the order for a codefendant to be tried in absentia; (vi)judgment of 13 November 2003 refusing an application by the prosecution for a hearing to be held in camera; (vii)judgment of 19 November 2003 on the examination of certain witnesses in camera; (viii)judgment of 18 December 2003 on an application by a codefendant for the examination of certain witnesses; (ix)judgment of 18 December 2003 on the use of recordings of a confrontation between witnesses; (x)judgment of 18 December 2003 on an application by the civil parties for the examination of witnesses who had failed to appear and the reexamination of other witnesses; (xi)judgment of 18 December 2003 on an application by a co-defendant for the examination or re-examination of the anonymous witness; (xii)judgment of 18 December 2003 on the applicant’s submissions as to the examination of witnesses who had failed to appear and the reexamination of other witnesses; (xiii)judgment of 18 December 2003 on an application by the applicant for the examination or re-examination of the anonymous witness. 14.In the last-mentioned judgment, concerning the application for an investigating judge to hear or rehear evidence from the person who had anonymously supplied information noted down by two non-commissioned gendarmerie officers, the Assize Court held: “This information, obtained anonymously by members of the police force, has no probative value as such. Accordingly, in the present case it simply constituted information capable of giving fresh impetus or a new slant to the investigation and enabling lawful evidence to be gathered independently. When examined as witnesses at the trial, [the two non-commissioned gendarmerie officers] stated that their informer was not one of the defendants and had not personally witnessed any of the acts he described; he had merely relayed information he claimed to have received in confidence from a person whose identity he refused to disclose. They also noted that some of the information supplied by their informer, relating in particular to other politicians mentioned in the submissions by counsel for Richard Taxquet ..., could not be corroborated by any evidence, despite their inquiries. ... In the investigators’ view, the process of drawing up an official record of information given to them by an anonymous informer did not in itself constitute any infringement of the defence rights of the persons named by the informer. That step solely involved the disclosure, with a view to its analysis and verification, of information that might be of interest to the investigation and might assist in clarifying the facts. Viewed in isolation from any objective data that might subsequently confirm it, this information did not constitute evidence of the acts allegedly carried out by the persons whose identity was mentioned by the informer. ... Lastly ... it is not possible to speak of a re-examination, seeing that it does not appear from the case file or the oral proceedings that [the person described as an anonymous witness] gave evidence under oath to an investigating judge. With regard to the application for an examination of that person, firstly, the court is unaware of his identity and, secondly, regardless of the considerations referred to by the judicial investigating bodies in that connection, such an examination does not appear useful for establishing the truth and would delay the proceedings needlessly without giving cause to hope for more certain results.” 15.The jury was asked to answer thirty-two questions put to it by the President of the Assize Court. Four of them concerned the applicant and were worded as follows: “Question 25 – PRINCIPAL COUNT Is the accused Richard Taxquet, who is present in court, guilty, as principal or joint principal, –either through having perpetrated the offence or having directly cooperated in its perpetration, –or through having, by any act whatsoever, lent such assistance to its perpetration that without it the offence could not have been committed, –or through having, by gifts, promises, threats, abuse of authority or power, scheming or contrivance, directly incited another to commit the offence, –or through having, by means of speeches in a public place or assembly, or by means of any written or printed matter, image or emblem displayed, distributed or sold, offered for sale or exhibited in a place where it could be seen by the public, directly incited another to commit the offence, of having knowingly and intentionally killed [A.C.] in Liège on 18 July 1991? Question 26 – AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE Was the intentional homicide referred to in the previous question premeditated? Question 27 – PRINCIPAL COUNT Is the accused Richard Taxquet, who is present in court, guilty, as principal or joint principal, –either through having perpetrated the offence or having directly cooperated in its perpetration, –or through having, by any act whatsoever, lent such assistance to its perpetration that without it the offence could not have been committed, –or through having, by gifts, promises, threats, abuse of authority or power, scheming or contrivance, directly incited another to commit the offence, –or through having, by means of speeches in a public place or assembly, or by means of any written or printed matter, image or emblem displayed, distributed or sold, offered for sale or exhibited in a place where it could be seen by the public, directly incited another to commit the offence, of having attempted knowingly and intentionally to kill [M.-H.J.] in Liège on 18July 1991, the intent to commit the offence having been manifested by conduct which objectively constituted the first step towards perpetration of the offence and which was halted or failed to attain the aim pursued only as a result of circumstances outside the control of the perpetrator? Question 28 – AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE Was the attempted intentional homicide referred to in the previous question premeditated?” 16.The jury answered “yes” to all four questions. 17.On 7 January 2004 the Assize Court sentenced the applicant to twenty years’ imprisonment. 18.The applicant appealed on points of law against his conviction of 7January 2004 by the Assize Court and all the interlocutory judgments given by that court. 19.In a judgment of 16 June 2004, the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal. It held, in particular, as follows: (i)the belated appearance of a co-defendant could not infringe the appellants’ defence rights as they had been able to challenge freely both the statements made by that defendant during the preliminary investigation and relayed at the trial by the persons to whom they had been given, and the statements made directly by the defendant before the jury; (ii)the Assize Court had rightly ordered that two witnesses should be examined in camera, fearing that they might not be able to express themselves freely if the hearing were public, which would hinder the proper administration of justice; (iii)in refusing, on the ground that such a step might delay the proceedings needlessly, to show the film of the confrontation between some of the defendants and certain Tunisian nationals against whom charges had been brought, the Assize Court had not breached the rights of the defence or the principle that hearings must be conducted orally, since the refusal had been based on the fact that those taking part in the confrontation, having appeared at the trial, had been directly confronted with the defendants; (iv)in directing that the proceedings should continue on the ground that the examination of certain witnesses who had failed to appear in court (having been properly summoned) was not necessary for establishing the truth, and in holding that a further appearance by certain other witnesses “would be likely to prolong the proceedings needlessly without giving cause to hope for more certain results”, the Assize Court had not breached Article6 of the Convention and the principle that hearings must be conducted orally; (v)since the presumption of innocence related above all to the attitude of the judges determining a criminal charge, comments by an investigator and reports in the press, even if inaccurate, malevolent or amounting to a criminal offence, could not in themselves cause the trial to breach Article 6 §§ 1 and 2 of the Convention; (vi)it could not be inferred from the jurors’ alleged inexperience, the speed with which they deliberated or the lack of reasons given for their verdict that they were incapable of impartial adjudication in a case that had attracted considerable press coverage; (vii)the procedure for appointing members of the jury and the fact that they reached their verdict as to guilt without having discussed the issue with the court did not mean that the Assize Court was not an independent and impartial tribunal established by law within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention or that the presumption of the accused’s innocence could not be lawfully rebutted in that court; (viii)neither Article 6 nor Article 13 of the Convention guaranteed the right of appeal; (ix)neither Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention nor Article 14 §3(b) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, nor Article 149 of the Constitution, even when taken in conjunction with the above-mentioned treaty provisions, placed any obligation on a jury to give reasons for its answers; (x)the ground of appeal relating to Article 6 § 3 (b) of the Convention (inability to confer freely with his lawyer as a result of his detention the day before the start of the trial) was inadmissible as it did not appear from the evidence in the file that the applicant had alleged before the Assize Court that there had been a violation of the right to have adequate facilities for the preparation of his defence; (xi)Articles 10 and 11 of the Constitution, Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 14 of the Convention did not lay down a requirement for reasons to be given for a verdict as to guilt, or the right of appeal or the right to appear before courts made up solely of professional judges; the discretion of the lay jury, which, moreover, was circumscribed by Articles 351, 352, 364 and 364 bis of the Code of Criminal Procedure, did not give rise to an arbitrary difference in treatment for the purposes of Article 14 of the Convention between those being tried by assize courts and those being tried by other criminal courts. 20.As to the ground of appeal contending that the appellants’ conviction had been decisively or incidentally based on the statements of an anonymous informer, the Court of Cassation stated: “In so far as they challenge the observation that the Assize Court was unaware of the identity of the person whose examination was being requested and could therefore not order it, these grounds of appeal, being directed against an obiter dictum, are immaterial. On that account, they are inadmissible. As to the remaining arguments, the presence in the criminal case file of a record containing information from an unidentified source does not require the trial court, as a condition for the validity or admissibility of the prosecution, to ensure that the informer is identified and examined in accordance with the procedure set forth in Articles 189 bis and 315 bis of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Those provisions leave it open to the trial court to appoint an investigating judge to that end if such a step appears useful for establishing the truth. The judgments take the view, on the basis of a factual assessment which this court is not empowered to overrule, that the examination sought would delay the proceedings needlessly without giving cause to hope for more certain results. The judgments also observe that the information obtained anonymously did not correspond to the evidence obtained lawfully and independently against the defendants. It does not appear from the Assize Court’s reply to the appellants’ submissions that the trial court contested their right to rebut the evidence produced at the trial. On that account, these grounds of appeal cannot be allowed. As to the remaining argument, Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention ... is not breached by the mere fact that the trial court considered it unnecessary or impossible to order the cross-examination of the anonymous informer whose disclosures provided helpful guidance for the investigation. On that account, these grounds of appeal have no basis in law.” 21.In the Questions à la Une programme broadcast by Radio-Télévision Belge Francophone (the State broadcaster for the French-speaking part of Belgium) in early 2006, one of the applicant’s co-defendants, S.N., stated that he had been the anonymous informer and had acted as a “middleman” on behalf of another co-defendant, D.C., whose accusations he had relayed. During the same programme, the identity of the anonymous witness was confirmed by the Minister of Justice who had been in post at the time of the events. S.N. said that he had received the sum of 3,000,000 Belgian francs (BEF) (74,368.06 euros (EUR)) from the Belgian State as a “middleman’s commission”. D.C. had allegedly received BEF 5,000,000 (EUR123,946.76). 22.Following the 1789 French Revolution, the jury featured in the 1791 French Constitution and the 1808 Code of Criminal Procedure. At that time, Belgium was part of French territory. When it was separated from France and attached to Holland, the jury was abolished but assize courts continued to exist. When Belgium gained independence, the institution of the jury was enshrined in the Constitution of 7 February 1831, Article 98 of which provided: “The jury shall be constituted for all serious crimes and for political and press offences.” The institution was envisaged by the framers of the Constitution as the touchstone of the authenticity of any democratic demand. The jury was seen above all as a political affirmation of the freedom won by the people, the symbol of the people’s sovereignty. It was instituted by the decree of 19 July 1831; membership was initially based on function (jury capacitaire) and subsequently, from 1869, on property (jury censitaire). By virtue of a Law of 21 December 1930, a new reform made the composition of the jury more democratic and representative of all social classes, the result being the twelve-member lay jury that still exists today. 23.Article 150 of the Consolidated Constitution of 17 February 1994 provides: “The jury shall be constituted for all serious crimes and for political and press offences, except for press offences motivated by racism or xenophobia” (text as amended on 7 May 1999). 24.Furthermore, Article 149 provides: “All judgments shall contain reasons; they shall be delivered in public.” 25.Proceedings in assize courts in Belgium afford a number of safeguards, particularly as regards the defence rights of the accused. 26.Article 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”) requires the Principal Public Prosecutor to draw up an indictment indicating the nature of the offence forming the basis of the charge, and any circumstances that may cause the sentence to be increased or reduced. Pursuant to Article313 of the CCP, the Principal Public Prosecutor must read out the indictment and the defendant or his counsel the statement of defence. Article 337 states that the questions put to the jury must derive from the indictment (which itself must be consistent with the judgment committing the accused for trial – Article 271 of the CCP) and must comply with certain formal requirements; for example, questions that are complex or concern points of law are prohibited. 27.At the close of the oral proceedings, questions are put to the jury in order to establish the factual circumstances of the case and any particular factors likely to lead to the precise determination of whether or not the accused is guilty as charged. The president of the Assize Court is empowered to put questions to the jury on all the circumstances which might have an influence on the facts which served as the basis for the indictment, provided that these circumstances were discussed during the oral proceedings. The principal question concerns the constituent elements of the offence, while there must be a separate question in respect of each count. Separate questions regarding other facts, such as aggravating circumstances or the existence of any justification or mitigating factor, may also be put. The prosecution and the accused can challenge the questions and have the opportunity to ask the president to put one or more additional questions to the jury. In the event of a dispute regarding the questions, the Assize Court must decide by a reasoned judgment. 28.Article 341 provides that, after asking the questions, the president hands them to the jury; at the same time, he hands over the indictment, the reports establishing the offence and the documents in the file other than the written witness statements. 29.In accordance with Article 342, once the questions have been put to and handed to the members of the jury, they retire to deliberate in private. The foreman is either the first member of the jury drawn by lot or is appointed by the jury with his or her consent. Before the deliberations begin, the foreman reads out the following instruction, which is also displayed in large type in the most visible place in the deliberation room: “The law does not ask jurors to account for how they reached their personal conviction; it does not lay down rules on which they are to place particular reliance as to the completeness and sufficiency of evidence; it requires them to ask themselves questions, in silence and contemplation, and to discern, in the sincerity of their conscience, what impression has been made on their rational faculties by the evidence against the defendant and the submissions of the defence. The law does not tell them: ‘You will hold every fact attested by this number of witnesses to be true’; nor does it tell them: ‘You will not regard as sufficiently established any evidence that does not derive from this report, these exhibits, this number of witnesses or this many clues’; it simply asks them this one question, which encompasses the full scope of their duties: ‘Are you inwardly convinced?’” 30.Article 343 authorises members of the jury to leave the deliberation room only when they have arrived at their verdict. 31.Lastly, Article 352 provides that if the judges are unanimously persuaded that the jurors, while complying with the procedural requirements, have made a substantive error, the court must stay the proceedings and adjourn the case until the following session for consideration by a new jury, which cannot include any of the original members. However, according to information supplied by the Government, this option has been used on only three occasions. 32.The Chamber judgment of 13 January 2009 has had repercussions on the case-law of the Belgian courts. 33.In judgment no. 2505 (P.09.0547.F) of 10 June 2009, the Court of Cassation held: “As to the ground of appeal, raised proprio motu, alleging a violation of Article 6 §1 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms: According to a judgment of 13 January 2009 of the European Court of Human Rights in [Taxquet v. Belgium, no. 926/05], the right to a fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention implies, where the Assize Court is concerned, that the decision on a criminal charge should highlight the considerations that have persuaded the jury of the accused’s guilt or innocence and should indicate the precise reasons why each of the questions has been answered in the affirmative or the negative. On account of the binding effect of interpretation now attaching to that judgment and the prevalence over domestic law of the international legal rule deriving from a treaty ratified by Belgium, the court is compelled to reject the application of Articles342 and 348 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in so far as they lay down the rule, now criticised by the European Court, that the jury’s verdict does not contain reasons. It appears from the documents to which the court may have regard, in particular the indictment, that during the preliminary investigation the appellant, who was prosecuted for murder as the principal or joint principal, provided explanations, as to the acts of which he was accused, which were rebutted by a witness whose identity was kept secret under Articles 86 bis and 86 ter of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In submissions filed with the Assize Court at the hearing on 18 February 2009 the appellant requested that the verdict contain reasons so that, in the event of his conviction, he could understand the grounds that had persuaded the jury to find him guilty, and so that the Court of Cassation could review the lawfulness of the verdict. With regard to the charge of murder against the appellant, the jury was asked to answer a principal question about his involvement in committing intentional homicide, an additional question on the statutory defence of provocation and two questions, in the alternative, on the offence provided for in Article 401 of the Criminal Code. The jury answered the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative, leaving the other questions unanswered. The judgment appealed against sentenced the appellant to eighteen years’ imprisonment for murder, on the basis of the verdict expressed solely by answers in the affirmative or the negative to the questions put in accordance with the law. The judgment states that there is no need to give any further reasons for the finding of guilt, on the ground that the precision of the questions adequately offsets the brevity of the decision. However, the bare statement that the appellant is guilty of murder and that there are no mitigating factors does not disclose the precise reasons why the charge, which the appellant denied, was found to have been made out, and does not enable this court to review, inter alia, whether the conviction was based to a decisive extent on the deposition by an anonymous witness incriminating the accused or was supported by other corroborating evidence in accordance with Article 341, paragraph 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure. While conforming to Belgian law, which does not require jurors to account for how they reached their personal conviction, the decision is contrary to Article 6 of the Convention in so far as that provision may be construed as meaning that the right to a fair trial encompasses a statement of reasons for the verdict.” 34.Other judgments to similar effect have subsequently been delivered. 35.In Belgium, even before the Chamber judgment in the Taxquet case, a Bill of 25 September 2008 that sought, among other things, to allow the president of the Assize Court to be present during the jury’s deliberations in order to assist its members was considered by the Senate. The proposed version of Article 350 of the CCP stated that the Assize Court should give reasons for its decision as to guilt, but was not required to address the parties’ submissions. 36.The Assize Court Reform Act of 21 December 2009, which was published in the Moniteur belge on 11 January 2010 and came into force on 21 January 2010, has introduced a requirement for the Assize Court to state the main reasons for its verdict. The relevant provisions of the CCP now read as follows: Article 327 “Once the questions have been put and handed to the jurors, they shall retire to the deliberation room to deliberate. The foreman is either the first member of the jury drawn by lot or is appointed by the jury with his or her consent. Before the deliberations begin, the foreman shall read out the following instruction, which shall also be displayed in large type in the most visible place in the deliberation room: ‘The law provides that the accused may be convicted only if it is apparent from the evidence admitted that he is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offence with which he is charged.’” Article 328 “The members of the jury may leave the deliberation room only when they have reached their verdict. No one may enter while they are deliberating, for any reason whatsoever, without the written authority of the president. The president may enter the room only if he is called by the foreman, in particular to answer questions of law, and is accompanied by his fellow judges, the accused and his counsel, the civil party and his counsel, the prosecution and the registrar. A reference to the incident shall be made in the record. ...” Article 334 “The court and the members of the jury shall then immediately retire to the deliberation room. Without having to address all the submissions filed, they shall formulate the principal reasons for their decision. The decision shall be signed by the president, the foreman of the jury and the registrar.” 37.The relevant Articles of the Criminal Code provide as follows: Article 51 “A criminal attempt is made out where the intent to commit a serious crime [crime] or other major offence [délit] has been manifested by conduct which objectively constituted the first step towards perpetration of the offence in question and which was halted or failed to attain the aim pursued only as a result of circumstances outside the control of the perpetrator.” Article 66 “The following shall be punished as perpetrators of a serious crime or other major offence: Those who have perpetrated the offence or have directly cooperated in its perpetration; Those who have, by any act whatsoever, lent such assistance to its perpetration that without it the offence could not have been committed; Those who have, by gifts, promises, threats, abuse of authority or power, scheming or contrivance, directly incited another to commit the offence; Those who have, by means of speeches in a public place or assembly, or by means of any written or printed matter, image or emblem displayed, distributed or sold, offered for sale or exhibited in a place where it can be seen by the public, directly incited another to commit the offence, without prejudice to the penalties provided for by the law against those who incite others to commit offences, even where such incitement has no effect.” Article 67 “The following shall be punished as accessories to a serious crime or other major offence: Those who have given instructions for its commission; Those who have procured weapons, implements or any other means used to commit the offence, knowing that they were intended for that purpose; Those who have, save in the case provided for in paragraph 3 of Article 66, knowingly aided or abetted the principal or principals in acts preparatory to or facilitating the commission of the offence or in its completion.” Article 393 “Homicide committed with intent to kill shall be classified as murder [meurtre]. It shall be punishable (by twenty to thirty years’ imprisonment).” Article 394 “Murder committed with premeditation shall be classified as premeditated murder [assassinat]. It shall be punishable (by life imprisonment).” 38.The Law of 1 April 2007 (which was published in the Moniteur belge on 9 May 2007 and came into force on 1 December 2007) entitles convicted persons to seek the reopening of their trial following a finding by the European Court of Human Rights of a violation of the Convention. 39.Article 442 bis of the CCP provides: “If a final judgment of the European Court of Human Rights has found that there has been a breach of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms or the Protocols thereto (hereinafter ‘the European Convention’), an application may be made for the reopening – in respect of criminal matters alone – of the proceedings that resulted in the applicant’s conviction in the case before the European Court of Human Rights or in the conviction of another person for the same offence on the basis of the same evidence.” 40.Article 442 ter of the CCP provides: “The following shall be entitled to apply for the reopening of the proceedings: (1)the convicted person; (2)if the convicted person has died, has been deprived of legal capacity or has been declared untraceable, the person’s spouse, lawful cohabitee, descendants, brothers and sisters; (3)the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, of his own motion or at the instigation of the Minister of Justice.” 41.Article 442 quinquies of the CCP provides: “Where it appears from consideration of the application either that the impugned decision is in breach of the European Convention on the merits or that the violation found is the result of procedural errors or shortcomings of such gravity as to cast serious doubt on the outcome of the proceedings in issue, the Court of Cassation shall order the reopening of the proceedings, provided that the convicted person or the entitled persons under Article 442 ter, point (2), continue to suffer very serious adverse consequences which cannot be redressed other than by reopening the trial.” 42.Following the Court’s judgment in Da Luz Domingues Ferreira v.Belgium (no. 50049/99, 24 May 2007), the Court of Cassation, in a judgment of 9 April 2008, ordered the reopening of the proceedings and withdrew the judgment it had delivered on 6 January 1999 (Journal des tribunaux, 2008, p. 403). 43.It is clear that there are many different models of lay adjudication in the member States of the Council of Europe. There are variations reflecting cultural and historical particularities even among countries that have opted for the “traditional” trial-by-jury model, the defining feature of which is that professional judges are unable to take part in the jurors’ deliberations on the verdict. 44.The member States may be divided into three categories: those without any form of jury trial or any model of lay adjudication in criminal matters; those using a collaborative court model of lay adjudicators sitting and deliberating alongside professional judges in criminal matters; and those which have opted for the “traditional” jury model in criminal matters. 45.Among the models examined, fourteen Council of Europe member States have never had a jury system or any other form of lay adjudication in criminal matters or have abolished it: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, the Netherlands, Romania, San Marino and Turkey. In these States criminal courts are composed exclusively of professional judges. 46.The member States with a collaborative system are Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Montenegro, Norway (in most cases), Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” and Ukraine. The collaborative system, which can also be employed alongside the traditional jury model, is characterised by the fact that the professional judges and the jurors collectively determine all questions of law and fact, the issue of guilt and the sentence. 47.The ten Council of Europe member States that have opted for a traditional jury system are Austria, Belgium, Georgia, Ireland, Malta, Norway (only in serious appeal cases), the Russian Federation, Spain, Switzerland (the Canton of Geneva until 1 January 2011), and the United Kingdom (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland). 48.In its traditional form, trial by jury involves a combination of a number of jurors sitting with one or more professional judges. The number of jurors varies according to the country and the subject matter of the proceedings. The number of professional judges varies from country to country. In Ireland, Malta, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom the court and jury are presided over by a single judge. In Austria, Belgium and Norway the court consists of three professional judges together with the jury. The professional judges cannot take part in the jury’s deliberations on the question of guilt, which falls within the exclusive competence of the jury. 49.In a number of countries the jurors are presented with a list of specific questions before they retire to deliberate on the facts of the case. Seven States – Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Norway, Russia, Spain and Switzerland – follow this practice. 50.In Ireland, England and Wales, at the conclusion of the evidence, the judge sums up the case to the jurors. He reminds them of the evidence they have heard. In doing so, the judge may give directions about the proper approach to take in respect of certain evidence. He also provides the jurors with information and explanations about the applicable legal rules. In that context, the judge clarifies the elements of the offence and sets out the chain of reasoning that should be followed in order to reach a verdict based on the jury’s findings of fact. 51.In Norway the judge directs the jurors on each legal issue raised and explains the rules they should follow when they retire to deliberate on the verdict. At the end of the trial, he also sums up the evidence to the jury or draws its attention to evidence of importance. 52.In Austria the jurors’ verdict is reached on the basis of a detailed questionnaire which sets out the main elements of the various charges and contains questions requiring a “yes” or “no” answer. 53.In principle, juries deliberate in private, without the presiding judge(s) being present. Indeed, the secrecy of the jury’s deliberations is a firmly established principle in many countries. 54.In Belgium a professional judge may be invited to the deliberation room to provide the jury with clarifications on a specific question, without being able to express a view or to vote on the issue of guilt. In Norway the jury may summon the presiding judge, but if the jury considers that it needs further clarifications as to the questions to be answered, the legal principles applicable or the procedure to be followed, or that the questions should be amended or new questions put, it must return to the courtroom, so that the matter can be raised in the presence of the parties. 55.In the Canton of Geneva the presiding judge attends the jury’s deliberations to provide assistance, but cannot give an opinion on the issue of guilt. A registrar is also present to make a record of the decisions taken and the reasons given. 56.The general rule appears to be that reasons are not given for verdicts reached by a traditional jury. This is the case for all the countries concerned, except Spain and Switzerland (Canton of Geneva). 57.In Spain the jury’s verdict is made up of five distinct parts. The first lists the facts held to be established, the second lists the facts held to be not established, the third contains the jury’s declaration as to whether the accused is guilty or not guilty, and the fourth provides a succinct statement of reasons for the verdict, indicating the evidence on which it is based and the reasons why particular facts have been held to be established or not. A fifth part contains a record of all the events that took place during the discussions, avoiding any identification that might infringe the secrecy of the deliberations. 58.Until 1991 the authorities of the Canton of Geneva considered that the jury satisfied the requirement of a reasoned decision by answering “yes” or “no” to the precise questions put to it. However, in a decision of 17December 1991 the Federal Court found such replies to be insufficient and required juries in the canton to give reasons for their verdicts in future. In 1992 Articles 298 and 308 of the Geneva Code of Criminal Procedure were amended to require the jury to state reasons for its choices should it consider that this was necessary for an understanding of its verdict or its decision. Article 327 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires the jury to state “the reasons for taking into account or disregarding the main items of evidence and the legal reasons for the jury’s verdict and the decision by the court and the jury as to the sentence or the imposition of any measure”. 59.Within the States that have opted for a traditional jury system, an appeal against the jury’s verdict is available in Georgia, Ireland, Malta, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, whereas no appeal is available in Austria, Belgium, Norway, Russia and Switzerland (Canton of Geneva). In Austria, convicted persons may appeal to the Court of Appeal against the sentence only; they may also file a plea of nullity with the Supreme Court. 60.In Belgium, since the events in issue in the present case, the Law of 21December 2009, which came into force on 21 January 2010 (see paragraph 36 above), has amended the procedure in the Assize Court, notably by requiring it to state the main reasons for the verdict reached by the jury, in order to clarify its meaning.",2010,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

The State shall communicate to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe the relevant provisions of that law.” “The member States of the Council of Europe signatory hereto, Convinced that everyone's right to life is a basic value in a democratic society and that the abolition of the death penalty is essential for the protection of this right and for the full recognition of the inherent dignity of all human beings; Wishing to strengthen the protection of the right to life guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed at Rome on 4 November 1950 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Convention'); Noting that Protocol No. 6 to the Convention, concerning the Abolition of the Death Penalty, signed at Strasbourg on 28 April 1983, does not exclude the death penalty in respect of acts committed in time of war or of imminent threat of war; Being resolved to take the final step in order to abolish the death penalty in all circumstances, Have agreed as follows: ...” Article 1 of Protocol No. 13 states: “The death penalty shall be abolished. No one shall be condemned to such penalty or executed.” “2.... its most recent resolutions on the subject, Resolution 1187 (1999) on Europe: a death-penalty free continent, and Resolution 1253 (2001) on the abolition of the death penalty in Council of Europe Observer states, in which it reaffirmed its beliefs that the application of the death penalty constitutes inhuman and degrading punishment and a violation of the most fundamental right, that to life itself, and that capital punishment has no place in civilised, democratic societies governed by the rule of law.” It further noted: “5.The second sentence of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights still provides for the death penalty. It has long been in the interest of the Assembly to delete this sentence, thus matching theory with reality. This interest is strengthened by the fact that more modern national constitutional documents and international treaties no longer include such provisions.” “Under no circumstances may a person convicted of terrorist activities be sentenced to the death penalty; in the event of such a sentence being imposed, it may not be carried out.” “[T]he imposition of a sentence of death upon the conclusion of a trial in which the provisions of the Covenant have not been respected constitutes ... a violation of Article6 of the Covenant. As the Committee noted in its general comment 6(7), the provision that a sentence of death may be imposed only in accordance with the law and not contrary to the provisions of the Covenant implies that 'the procedural guarantees therein prescribed must be observed, including the right to a fair hearing by an independent tribunal, the presumption of innocence, the minimum guarantees for the defence, and the right to review by a higher tribunal'.” “134.It might be useful to recall that in a previous examination of Article 4 of the American Convention (Restrictions to the Death Penalty, Advisory Opinion OC-3/83 of 8 September, 1983, Series A No. 3) the Court observed that the application and imposition of capital punishment are governed by the principle that '[n]o one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life'. Both Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 4 of the Convention require strict observance of legal procedure and limit application of this penalty to 'the most serious crimes'. In both instruments, therefore, there is a marked tendency toward restricting application of the death penalty and ultimately abolishing it. 135.This tendency, evident in other inter-American and universal instruments, translates into the internationally recognised principle whereby those States that still have the death penalty must, without exception, exercise the most rigorous control for observance of judicial guarantees in these cases. It is obvious that the obligation to observe the right to information becomes all the more imperative here, given the exceptionally grave and irreparable nature of the penalty that one sentenced to death could receive. If the due process of law, with all its rights and guarantees, must be respected regardless of the circumstances, then its observance becomes all the more important when that supreme entitlement that every human rights treaty and declaration recognises and protects is at stake: human life. 136.Because execution of the death penalty is irreversible, the strictest and most rigorous enforcement of judicial guarantees is required of the State so that those guarantees are not violated and a human life not arbitrarily taken as a result.” “Taking into account the exceptionally serious and irreparable nature of the death penalty, the observance of due process, with its bundle of rights and guarantees, becomes all the more important when human life is at stake.” (paragraph 148)",2005,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

50,001-59885,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicant made the following allegations concerning the events underlying the dispute he submitted to the English courts. The Government stated that they were not in a position to comment on the accuracy of these claims. 10.The applicant, who is a trained pilot, went to Kuwait in 1991 to assist in its defence against Iraq. During the Gulf War he served as a member of the Kuwaiti Air Force and, after the Iraqi invasion, he remained behind as a member of the resistance movement. During that period he came into possession of sex videotapes involving Sheikh Jaber Al-Sabah Al-Saud Al-Sabah (“the Sheikh”), who is related to the Emir of Kuwait and is said to have an influential position in Kuwait. By some means these tapes entered general circulation, for which the applicant was held responsible by the Sheikh. 11.After the Iraqi armed forces were expelled from Kuwait, on or about 2 May 1991, the Sheikh and two others gained entry to the applicant’s house, beat him and took him at gunpoint in a government jeep to the Kuwaiti State Security Prison. The applicant was falsely imprisoned there for several days during which he was repeatedly beaten by security guards. He was released on 5 May 1991, having been forced to sign a false confession. 12.On or about 7 May 1991 the Sheikh took the applicant at gunpoint in a government car to the palace of the Emir of Kuwait’s brother. At first the applicant’s head was repeatedly held underwater in a swimming-pool containing corpses, and he was then dragged into a small room where the Sheikh set fire to mattresses soaked in petrol, as a result of which the applicant was seriously burnt. 13.Initially the applicant was treated in a Kuwaiti hospital, and on 17May 1991 he returned to England where he spent six weeks in hospital being treated for burns covering 25% of his total body surface area. He also suffered psychological damage and has been diagnosed as suffering from a severe form of post-traumatic stress disorder, aggravated by the fact that, once in England, he received threats warning him not to take action or give publicity to his plight. 14.On 29 August 1992 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in England for compensation against the Sheikh and the State of Kuwait in respect of injury to his physical and mental health caused by torture in Kuwait in May 1991 and threats against his life and well-being made after his return to the United Kingdom on 17 May 1991. On 15 December 1992 he obtained a default judgment against the Sheikh. 15.The proceedings were re-issued after an amendment to include two named individuals as defendants. On 8 July 1993 a deputy High Court judge ex parte gave the applicant leave to serve the proceedings on the individual defendants. This decision was confirmed in chambers on 2 August 1993. He was not, however, granted leave to serve the writ on the State of Kuwait. 16.The applicant submitted a renewed application to the Court of Appeal, which was heard ex parte on 21 January 1994. Judgment was delivered the same day. The court held, on the basis of the applicant’s allegations, that there were three elements pointing towards State responsibility for the events in Kuwait: firstly, the applicant had been taken to a State prison; secondly, government transport had been used on 2 and 7 May 1991; and, thirdly, in the prison he had been mistreated by public officials. It found that the applicant had established a good arguable case, based on principles of international law, that Kuwait should not be afforded immunity under section 1(1) of the State Immunity Act 1978 (“the 1978 Act”: see paragraph21 below) in respect of acts of torture. In addition, there was medical evidence indicating that the applicant had suffered damage (post-traumatic stress) while in the United Kingdom. It followed that the conditions in Order 11 rule 1(f) of the Rules of the Supreme Court had been satisfied (see paragraph 20 below) and that leave should be granted to serve the writ on the State of Kuwait. 17.The Kuwaiti government, after receiving the writ, sought an order striking out the proceedings. The application was examined inter partes by the High Court on 15 March 1995. In a judgment delivered the same day the court held that it was for the applicant to show on the balance of probabilities that the State of Kuwait was not entitled to immunity under the 1978 Act. It was prepared provisionally to accept that the Government were vicariously responsible for conduct that would qualify as torture under international law. However, international law could be used only to assist in interpreting lacunae or ambiguities in a statute, and when the terms of a statute were clear, the statute had to prevail over international law. The clear language of the 1978 Act bestowed immunity upon sovereign States for acts committed outside the jurisdiction and, by making express provision for exceptions, it excluded as a matter of construction implied exceptions. As a result, there was no room for an implied exception for acts of torture in section 1(1) of the 1978 Act. Moreover, the court was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the State of Kuwait was responsible for the threats made to the applicant after 17 May 1991. As a result, the exception provided for by section 5 of the 1978 Act could not apply. It followed that the action against the State should be struck out. 18.The applicant appealed and the Court of Appeal examined the case on 12 March 1996. The court held that the applicant had not established on the balance of probabilities that the State of Kuwait was responsible for the threats made in the United Kingdom. The important question was, therefore, whether State immunity applied in respect of the alleged events in Kuwait. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith finding against the applicant, observed: “Jurisdiction of the English court in respect of foreign States is governed by the State Immunity Act 1978. Section 1(1) provides: ... The only relevant exception is section 5, which provides: It is plain that the events in Kuwait do not fall within the exception in section 5, and the express words of section 1 provide immunity to the First Defendant. Despite this, in what [counsel] for the Plaintiff acknowledges is a bold submission, he contends that that section must be read subject to the implication that the State is only granted immunity if it is acting within the Law of Nations. So that the section reads: ‘A State acting within the Law of Nations is immune from jurisdiction except as provided ...’ ... The argument is ... that international law against torture is so fundamental that it is a jus cogens, or compelling law, which overrides all other principles of international law, including the well-established principles of sovereign immunity. No authority is cited for this proposition. ... At common law, a sovereign State could not be sued at all against its will in the courts of this country. The 1978 Act, by the exceptions therein set out, marks substantial inroads into this principle. It is inconceivable, it seems to me, that the draughtsman, who must have been well aware of the various international agreements about torture, intended section 1 to be subject to an overriding qualification. Moreover, authority in the United States at the highest level is completely contrary to [counsel for the applicant’s] submission. [Lord Justice Stuart-Smith referred to the judgments of the United States courts, Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corporation and Siderman de Blake v. Republic of Argentina, cited in paragraph 23 below, in both of which the court rejected the argument that there was an implied exception to the rule of State immunity where the State acted contrary to the Law of Nations.] ... [Counsel] submits that we should not follow the highly persuasive judgments of the American courts. I cannot agree. ... A moment’s reflection is enough to show that the practical consequences of the Plaintiff’s submission would be dire. The courts in the United Kingdom are open to all who seek their help, whether they are British citizens or not. A vast number of people come to this country each year seeking refuge and asylum, and many of these allege that they have been tortured in the country whence they came. Some of these claims are no doubt justified, others are more doubtful. Those who are presently charged with the responsibility for deciding whether applicants are genuine refugees have a difficult enough task, but at least they know much of the background and surrounding circumstances against which the claim is made. The court would be in no such position. The foreign States would be unlikely to submit to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom court, and in its absence the court would have no means of testing the claim or making a just determination. ...” The other two members of the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Ward and MrJustice Buckley, also rejected the applicant’s claim. Lord Justice Ward commented that “there may be no international forum (other than the forum of the locus delicti to whom a victim of torture will be understandably reluctant to turn) where this terrible, if established, wrong can receive civil redress”. 19.On 27 November 1996 the applicant was refused leave to appeal by the House of Lords. His attempts to obtain compensation from the Kuwaiti authorities via diplomatic channels have proved unsuccessful. 20.There is no rule under English law requiring a plaintiff to be resident in the United Kingdom or to be a British national before the English courts can assert jurisdiction over civil wrongs committed abroad. Under the rules in force at the time the applicant issued proceedings, the writ could be served outside the territorial jurisdiction with the leave of the court when the claim fell within one or more of the categories set out in order 11, Rule 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court. For present purposes only Rule 1(f) is relevant: “... service of a writ out of the jurisdiction is permissible with the leave of the court if, in the action begun by the writ, ... (f)the claim is founded on a tort and the damage was sustained, or resulted from an act committed, within the jurisdiction ...” 21.The relevant parts of the State Immunity Act 1978 provide: “1.(1)A State is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom except as provided in the following provisions of this Part of this Act. ...>A State is not immune as regards proceedings in respect of- (a)death or personal injury; ... caused by an act or omission in the United Kingdom ...” 22.The above provision (section 5 of the 1978 Act) was enacted to implement the 1972 European Convention on State Immunity (“the Basle Convention”), a Council of Europe instrument, which entered into force on 11 June 1976 after its ratification by three States. It has now been ratified by eight States (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) and signed by one other State (Portugal). Article 11 of the Convention provides: “A Contracting State cannot claim immunity from the jurisdiction of a court of another Contracting State in proceedings which relate to redress for injury to the person or damage to tangible property, if the facts which occasioned the injury or damage occurred in the territory of the State of forum, and if the author of the injury or damage was present in that territory at the time when those facts occurred.” Article 15 of the Basle Convention provides that a Contracting State shall be entitled to immunity if the proceedings do not fall within the stated exceptions. 23.In its Report on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property (1999), the working group of the International Law Commission (ILC) found that over the preceding decade a number of civil claims had been brought in municipal courts, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, against foreign governments, arising out of acts of torture committed not in the territory of the forum State but in the territory of the defendant and other States. The working group of the ILC found that national courts had in some cases shown sympathy for the argument that States are not entitled to plead immunity where there has been a violation of human rights norms with the character of jus cogens, although in most cases the plea of sovereign immunity had succeeded. The working group cited the following cases in this connection: (United Kingdom) Al-Adsani v. State of Kuwait 100 International Law Reports 465 at 471; (New Zealand) Controller and Auditor General v. Sir Ronald Davidson [1996] 2 New Zealand Law Reports 278, particularly at 290 (per Cooke P.); Dissenting Opinion of Justice Wald in (United States) Princz v. Federal Republic of Germany 26 F 3d 1166 (DC Cir. 1994) at 1176-1185; Siderman de Blake v. Republic of Argentina 965 F 2d 699 (9th Cir. 1992); Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corporation 488 US 428 (1989); Saudi Arabia v. Nelson 100 International Law Reports 544. 24.The working group of the ILC did, however, note two recent developments which it considered gave support to the argument that a State could not plead immunity in respect of gross human rights violations. One of these was the House of Lords’ judgment in ex parte Pinochet (No. 3) (see paragraph 34 below). The other was the amendment by the United States of its Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) to include a new exception to immunity. This exception, introduced by section 221 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, applies in respect of a claim for damages for personal injury or death caused by an act of torture, extra-judicial killing, aircraft sabotage or hostage-taking, against a State designated by the Secretary of State as a sponsor of terrorism, where the claimant or victim was a national of the United States at the time the act occurred. In its judgment in Flatow v. the Islamic Republic of Iran and Others (76 F. Supp. 2d 16, 18 (D.D.C. 1999)), the District Court for the District of Columbia confirmed that the property of a foreign State was immune from attachment or execution, unless the case fell within one of the statutory exceptions, for example that the property was used for commercial activity. 25.The Kuwaiti Constitution provides in Article 31 that “No person shall be put to torture”. 26.Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 states: “No one shall be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” 27.Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 states as relevant: “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” 28.The United Nations 1975 Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment provides in Article 3 that: “No State may permit or tolerate torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” 29.In the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted on 10 December 1984 (“the UN Convention”), torture is defined as: “For the purposes of this Convention, the term ‘torture’ means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.” The UN Convention requires by Article 2 that each State Party is to take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent torture in any territory under its jurisdiction, and by Article 4 that all acts of torture be made offences under each State’s criminal law. 30.In its judgment in Prosecutor v. Furundzija (10 December 1998, case no. IT-95-17/I-T, (1999) 38 International Legal Materials 317), the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia observed as follows: “144.It should be noted that the prohibition of torture laid down in human rights treaties enshrines an absolute right, which can never be derogated from, not even in time of emergency ... This is linked to the fact, discussed below, that the prohibition on torture is a peremptory norm or jus cogens. ... This prohibition is so extensive that States are even barred by international law from expelling, returning or extraditing a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture. 145.These treaty provisions impose upon States the obligation to prohibit and punish torture, as well as to refrain from engaging in torture through their officials. In international human rights law, which deals with State responsibility rather than individual criminal responsibility, torture is prohibited as a criminal offence to be punished under national law; in addition, all States parties to the relevant treaties have been granted, and are obliged to exercise, jurisdiction to investigate, prosecute and punish offenders. ... 146.The existence of this corpus of general and treaty rules proscribing torture shows that the international community, aware of the importance of outlawing this heinous phenomenon, has decided to suppress any manifestation of torture by operating both at the interstate level and at the level of individuals. No legal loopholes have been left. 147.There exists today universal revulsion against torture ... . This revulsion, as well as the importance States attach to the eradication of torture, has led to a cluster of treaty and customary rules on torture acquiring a particularly high status in the international, normative system. ... 151. ... the prohibition of torture imposes on States obligations erga omnes, that is, obligations owed towards all the other members of the international community. ... 153.... the other major feature of the principle proscribing torture relates to the hierarchy of rules in the international normative order. Because of the importance of the values it protects, this principle has evolved into a peremptory norm or jus cogens, that is, a norm that enjoys a higher rank in the international hierarchy than treaty law and even ‘ordinary’ customary rules. The most conspicuous consequence of this higher rank is that the principle at issue cannot be derogated from by States through international treaties or local or special or even general customary rules not endowed with the same normative force. 154.Clearly the jus cogens nature of the prohibition against torture articulates the notion that the prohibition has now become one of the most fundamental standards of the international community. ...” 31.Similar statements were made in Prosecutor v. Delacic and Others (16 November 1998, case no. IT-96-21-T, § 454) and in Prosecutor v.Kunarac (22 February 2001, case nos. IT-96-23-T and IT-96-23/1, §466). 32.The United Kingdom ratified the UN Convention with effect from 8December 1988. 33.Section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which entered into force on 29 September 1988, made torture, wherever committed, a criminal offence under United Kingdom law triable in the United Kingdom. 34.In its Regina v. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate and Others, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 3), judgment of 24 March 1999 [2000] Appeal Cases 147, the House of Lords held that the former President of Chile, Senator Pinochet, could be extradited to Spain in respect of charges which concerned conduct that was criminal in the United Kingdom at the time when it was allegedly committed. The majority of the Law Lords considered that extraterritorial torture did not become a crime in the United Kingdom until section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 came into effect. The majority considered that although under Part II of the State Immunity Act 1978 a former head of State enjoyed immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for acts done in his official capacity, torture was an international crime and prohibited by jus cogens (peremptory norms of international law). The coming into force of the UN Convention (see paragraph 29 above) had created a universal criminal jurisdiction in all the Contracting States in respect of acts of torture by public officials, and the States Parties could not have intended that an immunity for ex-heads of State for official acts of torture would survive their ratification of the UN Convention. The House of Lords (and, in particular, Lord Millett, at p. 278) made clear that their findings as to immunity ratione materiae from criminal jurisdiction did not affect the immunity ratione personae of foreign sovereign States from civil jurisdiction in respect of acts of torture.",2001,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

85,001-72932,Grand Chamber,"13.On an unspecified date E.A.S., a company, applied to the Benevento District Court for an order against the applicant for payment of 7,500,000Italian lire (3,873.43 euros (EUR)) in performance of a contract for professional services. In a decision of 13 October 1988 the president of the court granted the application. The order was served on the applicant by E.A.S. on 28November 1988. On 3 December 1988 the applicant challenged it in the same court. 14.Preparation of the case for trial began on 13 January 1989. On 18January 1989 the case was joined to another case that was pending between the same parties. The immediate enforcement of the order was suspended. Of the seventeen hearings listed between 14 June 1989 and 26November 1998 two were devoted to hearing evidence from the applicant, three to hearing other evidence, six were adjourned by the court of its own motion, one was adjourned to allow the parties to reach a friendly settlement, four were adjourned at the request of the applicant or both parties and one was adjourned because E.A.S. had failed to appear. 15.However, on an unspecified date the case was referred to the bench of judges dealing with the oldest cases (sezione stralcio). Of the six hearings listed between 16 March 1999 and 28 November 2001 one was adjourned because E.A.S. had not appeared (owing to the registry’s failure to notify it of the date to which the hearing had been adjourned by the court of its own motion), one because of a lawyers’ strike, one to allow the parties to make their submissions, and two by the court of its own motion. 16.Six hearings later, on 13 April 2005 the court set the case down for hearing of oral submissions on 8 June 2005. On that date judgment was reserved. According to information provided by the applicant on 12 October 2005, the proceedings were still pending. 17.On 10 January 2002 the applicant lodged an application with the Rome Court of Appeal under Law no.89 of 24March2001, known as the “Pinto Act”, complaining of the length of the above-described proceedings. He asked the court to rule that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to order the to pay compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage sustained. The applicant claimed EUR14,460.94 in pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages. He sought the reimbursement of his legal costs, including those incurred before the Court, but did not quantify or give particulars of them. 18.In a decision of 21 June 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 3 September 2002, the Court of Appeal found that the length of the proceedings had been excessive. It held as follows: The Court of Appeal awarded the applicant EUR1,000 on an equitable basis in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, and EUR800 for costs and expenses, including those incurred before the Court, but without giving a breakdown. 19.In a letter of 21 January 2003 the applicant informed the Court of the outcome of the domestic proceedings and asked the Court to continue its examination of his application. 20.The applicant did not indicate that he had appealed to the Court of Cassation. 21.The Court of Appeal’s decision was served on 23 January 2003 and became final on 24 March 2003. The applicant served the authorities with notice to comply on 11 October 2003. The applicant lodged an application for a garnishee order with the judge responsible for enforcement proceedings and a hearing was held on 28 March 2004. After obtaining a garnishee order on 27 May 2004, the amounts were paid on an unspecified date after service of the order. 22.Award of just satisfaction in the event of a breach of the requirement to dispose of proceedings within a reasonable time and amendment to Article 375 of the Code of Civil Procedure. CHAPTER II Just satisfaction Section 2 Entitlement to just satisfaction “1.Anyone sustaining pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage as a result of a violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, on account of a failure to comply with the ‘reasonable-time’ requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, shall be entitled to just satisfaction.>In determining whether there has been a violation, the court shall have regard to the complexity of the case and, in the light thereof, the conduct of the parties and of the judge deciding procedural issues, and also the conduct of any authority required to participate in or contribute to the resolution of the case.>The court shall assess the quantum of damage in accordance with Article 2056 of the Civil Code and shall apply the following rules: Section 3 Procedure “1.Claims for just satisfaction shall be lodged with the court of appeal in which the judge sits who has jurisdiction under Article 11 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to try cases concerning members of the judiciary in the district where the case in which the violation is alleged to have occurred was decided or discontinued at the merits stage or is still pending.>The claim shall be made on an application lodged with the registry of the court of appeal by a lawyer holding a special authority containing all the information prescribed by Article 125 of the Code of Civil Procedure.>The application shall be made against the Minister of Justice where the alleged violation has taken place in proceedings in the ordinary courts, the Minister of Defence where it has taken place in proceedings before the military courts and the Finance Minister where it has taken place in proceedings before the tax commissioners. In all other cases, the application shall be made against the Prime Minister.>The court of appeal shall hear the application in accordance with Articles 737 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure. The application and the order setting the case down for hearing shall be served by the applicant on the defendant authority at its elected domicile at the offices of State Counsel (Avvocatura dello Stato) at least fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing before the Chamber.>The parties may apply to the court for an order for production of all or part of the procedural and other documents from the proceedings in which the violation referred to in section 2 is alleged to have occurred and they and their lawyers shall be entitled to be heard by the court in private if they attend the hearing.

An appeal shall lie to the Court of Cassation. The decision shall be enforceable immediately.>To the extent that resources permit, payment of compensation to those entitled shall commence on 1 January .” Section 4 Time-limits and procedures for lodging applications “A claim for just satisfaction may be lodged while the proceedings in which the violation is alleged to have occurred are pending or within six months from the date when the decision ending the proceedings becomes final. Claims lodged after that date shall be time-barred.” Section 5 Communications “If the court decides to allow an application, its decision shall be communicated by the registry to the parties, to State Counsel at the Court of Audit to enable him to start an investigation into liability, and to the authorities responsible for deciding whether to institute disciplinary proceedings against the civil servants involved in the proceedings in any capacity.” Section 6 Transitional provisions “1.Within six months after the entry into force of this Act, anyone who has lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights in due time complaining of a violation of the ‘reasonable-time’ requirement contained in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, shall be entitled to lodge a claim under section 3 hereof provided that the application has not by then been declared admissible by the . In such cases, the application to the court of appeal must state when the application to the said was made.>The registry of the relevant court shall inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs without delay of any claim lodged in accordance with section 3 and within the period laid down in subsection 1 of this section.” Section 7 Financial provisions “1.The financial cost of implementing this Act, which is put at 12,705,000,000Italian lire from 2002, shall be met by releasing funds entered in the three-year budget 2001-03 in the chapter concerning the basic current-liability estimates from the ‘special fund’ in the year 2001 forecast of the Ministry of the Treasury, Economy and Financial Planning. Treasury deposits shall be set aside for that purpose.>The Ministry of the Treasury, Economy and Financial Planning is authorised to make the appropriate budgetary adjustments by decree.” 23.On appeal from decisions delivered by the courts of appeal in “Pinto” proceedings, the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court (Sezioni Unite), gave four judgments (nos. 1338, 1339, 1340 and 1341) on 27November 2003, the texts of which were deposited with the registry on 26January 2004, quashing the appeal court’s decision and remitting the case for a rehearing. It held that “the case-law of the is binding on the Italian courts regarding the application of Law no. 89/2001”. In its judgment no. 1340 it affirmed, inter alia, the principle that “the court of appeal’s determination of non-pecuniary damage in accordance with section 2 of Law no. 89/2001, although inherently based on equitable principles, must be done in a legally defined framework since reference has to be made to the amounts awarded, in similar cases, by the . Some divergence is permissible, within reason.” 24.Extracts from the plenary Court of Cassation’s judgment no.1339 deposited with the registry on 26 January 2004 “... 2.- The present application poses the fundamental question of what legal effect must be given – in implementing the Law of 24 March 2001 no. 89, and in particular in determining the non-pecuniary damage arising out of the breach of the reasonable length of proceedings requirement – to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, whether considered generally as interpretative guidelines which the said Court has laid down with regard to the consequences of the said violation, or with reference to a specific case in which the European Court has already had occasion to give a judgment on the delay in reaching a decision. ... As stipulated in section 2.1 of the said Law, the legal fact which gives rise to the right to the just satisfaction that it provides for is constituted by the “violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified in accordance with the Law of 4 August 1955 no. 848, for failure to comply with the reasonable time referred to in Article 6, paragraph1 of the Convention.” In other words, Law no. 89/2001 identifies the fact constituting the right to compensation by reference to a specific provision of the European Convention on Human Rights. This Convention instituted a Court (the European Court of Human Rights, with its seat in ) to ensure compliance with the provisions contained therein (Article 19). Accordingly, the competence of the said court to determine, and therefore to interpret, the significance of the said provisions must be recognised. As the fact constituting the right conferred by Law no. 89/2001 consists of a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, it is for the Court of the European Convention on Human Rights to determine all the elements of such a legal fact, which thus ends by being “brought into conformity” by the Strasbourg Court, whose case-law is binding on the Italian courts in so far as the application of Law no. 89/2001 is concerned. It is not necessary therefore to pose the general problem of the relationships between the European Convention on Human Rights and the internal judicial system, which the Advocate-General (Procuratore Generale) has amply discussed in court. Whatever opinion one may have about that controversial issue and therefore about the place of the European Convention on Human Rights in the context of the sources of domestic law, it is certain that the direct implementation in the Italian judicial system of a provision of the European Convention on Human Rights, established by Law no. 89/2001 (that is, by Article 6 § 1 in the part relating to “reasonable time”), cannot diverge from the interpretation which the European Court gives of the same provision. The opposite argument, which would permit a substantial divergence between the application accorded to Law no. 89/2001 in the national system and the interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court to the right to reasonable length of proceedings, would deprive the said Law no. 89/2001 of any justification and cause the Italian State to violate Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, according to which ‘The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention’ (including the said Article 6, which provides for the right to have a case decided within a reasonable length of time). The reason behind the enactment of Law no. 89/2001 was the need to provide a domestic judicial remedy against violations in respect of the duration of proceedings, so as to give effect to the subsidiary character of intervention on the part of the Court of Strasbourg, expressly provided for by the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 35: “the Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted”). The European system for the protection of human rights is founded on the said principle of subsidiarity. From it derives the duty of the States which have ratified the European Convention on Human Rights to guarantee to individuals the protection of the rights recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights, above all in their own internal order and vis-à-vis the organs of the national judicial system. And this protection must be “effective” (Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights), that is, of a kind to remedy the claim without the need for recourse to the . The domestic remedy introduced by Law no. 89/2001 did not previously exist in the Italian system, with the consequence that appeals against in respect of a violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights had “clogged” (the term used by rapporteur Follieri in the sitting of the Senate of 28 September 2000) the . The observed, prior to Law no. 89/2001, that the said failures to comply on the part of “reflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy. This accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention” (see the four judgments of the Court delivered on 28 July in the cases of Bottazzi, Di Mauro, Ferrari and A. P.). Law no. 89/2001 constitutes the domestic remedy to which a “victim of a violation” (as defined by Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights) of Article 6 (failure to comply with the reasonable-time requirement) must have recourse before applying to the European Court to claim the “just satisfaction” provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which, when the violation exists, is only awarded by the Court “if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made”. Law no. 89/2001 has therefore allowed the European Court to declare inadmissible applications lodged with it (including before the Act was passed) and aimed at obtaining just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights for the excessive length of proceedings (Brusco v. Italy, decision of 6 September 2001). This mechanism for implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights and observance of the principle of subsidiarity in respect of interventions of the European Court of Strasbourg does not operate, however, in cases in which the Court holds that the consequences of the established violation of the European Convention on Human Rights have not been redressed by domestic law or that this has been done only “partially”, because in such an event the said Article 41 provides for the intervention of the European Court to protect the “victim of the violation”. In such cases an individual application to the on the basis of Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights is admissible (Scordino and Others v. Italy, decision of 27 March 2003) and the Court acts directly to protect the rights of the victim whom it considers not to have been adequately protected by domestic law. The judge of the adequacy or inadequacy of the protection that the victim has had from domestic law is, obviously, the European Court, whose duty it is to apply Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights to ascertain whether, in the presence of a violation of a provision of the European Convention on Human Rights, the internal law has been able to fully redress the consequences of this violation. The argument whereby, in applying Law no. 89/2001, the Italian court may follow a different interpretation from that which the European Court has given to the provisions of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (violation of which is the fact giving entitlement to the right to compensation attributed by the said national law) implies that the victim of the violation, if he or she receives reparation at national level considered inadequate by the European Court, must obtain the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights from the latter Court. This would defeat the purpose of the remedy provided for in Italian law by Law no. 89/2001 and entail a violation of the principle of the subsidiarity of the intervention of the . It is therefore necessary to concur with the European Court of Human Rights, which, in the above-mentioned decision on the Scordino application (concerning the inadequacy of the protection afforded by the Italian courts in implementing Law no. 89/2001), affirmed that “it follows from the principle of subsidiarity ... that the national courts must, where possible, interpret and apply domestic law in accordance with the Convention”. ... The preparatory documents of Law no. 89/2001 are even more explicit. In the report concerning the bill of Senator Pinto (proceedings of the Senate no. 3813 of 16February 1999) it is affirmed that the compensatory mechanism proposed in the legislative initiative (and then adopted by the Act) secures for the applicant “a protection analogous to that which he or she would receive in the international court”, as the direct reference to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights makes it possible to transfer to domestic level “the limits of applicability of the same provision existing at international level, limits which depend essentially on the State and on the development of the case-law of the Strasbourg authorities, especially that of the European Court of Human Rights, whose decisions must therefore guide ... the domestic court in the definition of these limits”. ... 6.– The considerations expounded in sections 3-5 of the document refer in general to the importance of the interpretative guidance of the on the implementation of Law no. 89/2001 with regard to reparation for non-pecuniary damage. In this particular instance, however, any possibility for the national court to exclude non-pecuniary damage (despite having found a violation of Article6 of the European Convention on Human Rights) must be considered as non-existent because such is precluded by the previous decision of the European Court which, with reference to the same proceedings, had already ascertained that the unjustified delay in reaching a decision had had consequences involving non-pecuniary damage for the applicant, which the Court itself redressed for a limited period. From such a decision of the it follows that, once the national court has ascertained that the violation has continued in the period following that considered in the said decision, the applicant has continued to suffer non-pecuniary damage, which must be compensated for in application of Law no. 89/2001. It cannot therefore be maintained – as the Rome Court of Appeal has done – that compensation is not due because of the small amounts at stake in the proceedings in question. Such a reason, apart from being rendered immaterial by the fact that the European Court has already ruled that non-pecuniary damage had been sustained because of delay in the same action, is in any case incorrect, because the amount of what is at stake in an action in which non-compliance with reasonable time-limits has been ascertained can never have the effect of excluding non-pecuniary damage, given that the anxiety and distress resulting from the length of the proceedings normally also occur in cases in which the amounts at stake are small; hence this aspect may have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation but not of totally excluding it. 7– In conclusion the decision appealed against must be quashed and the case remitted to the Rome Court of Appeal, which, in a different composition, will order payment to the applicant of the non-pecuniary damages payable as a result of the violation of the reasonable-time requirement for the period following 16 April 1996 alone, taking as a reference point payments of the same kind of damages by the European Court of Human Rights, from which it may diverge, but only to a reasonable extent (HR Court, 27 March 2003, Scordino v. Italy)”. 25.The Court of Cassation held as follows: 26.The Court of Cassation judges noted that the right to compensation for a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time derived from the Pinto Act. The mechanism set in place by the European standard did not give applicants a cause of action before the domestic courts. Accordingly, the right to “just satisfaction” could neither be acquired nor transferred by a person who had already died by the time the Pinto Act came into force. The fact that the deceased had, while alive, lodged an application with the was not decisive. Section 6 of the Pinto Act did not constitute, as the applicants had maintained, a procedural standard bringing about a transfer of powers from the to the domestic courts. 27.In this case, which concerned the possibility or otherwise of transferring to heirs the right to compensation deriving from a breach of Article 6 § 1 on account of the length of the proceedings, the First Division of the Court of Cassation referred the case to the full court indicating that there was a conflict between the case-law authorities, that is, between the restrictive approach taken by the Court of Cassation in the earlier judgments regarding heirs and the Pinto Act and the four judgments delivered by the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, on 26 January 2004 to the extent that a less strict interpretation would lead to the conclusion that this right to compensation has existed since Italy ratified the European Convention on 4 August 1955. 28.In the case giving rise to the order mentioned above referring the case to the full court (see preceding paragraph), the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, established the following principles, thus preventing any further conflicting decisions being given by the courts: (i) Law no.848 of 4 August 1955, which ratified the Convention and made it enforceable, introduced into domestic legal order the fundamental rights, belonging to the category of rights conferred on the individual by public law, provided for in the first section of the Convention and which correspond to a large extent with those set forth in Article 2 of the Constitution. In that respect the Convention provisions are confirmatory and illustrative. ... (ii) It is necessary to reiterate the principle that the act giving rise to the right to reparation conferred by domestic law corresponds to a breach of the provision in Article 6 of the Convention, which is immediately applicable in domestic law. The distinction between the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, introduced by the European Convention on Human Rights (or even pre-existing as a constitutionally protected value), and the right to equitable reparation, which was allegedly introduced only by the Pinto Act, cannot be allowed in so far as the protection provided by the domestic courts does not depart from that previously offered by the Strasbourg Court, the domestic courts being bound to comply with the case-law of the European Court. ... (iii) Accordingly, the right to equitable reparation for loss sustained as a result of the unreasonable length of proceedings prior to the entry into force of Law no. 89/2001 must be acknowledged by the domestic courts even in favour of the heirs of a party who introduced the proceedings before that date, subject only to the condition that the claim has not already been lodged with the Strasbourg Court and the Court has not ruled on admissibility. ... 29.This judgment of the Court of Cassation concerned an appeal by the Ministry of Justice challenging the Court of Appeal’s award of non-pecuniary damages to a juristic person. The Court of Cassation referred to the decision reached in the case of Comingersoll v. Portugal [GC], no.35382/97, ECHR 2000IV and, after referring to the four judgments of the full court delivered on 26 January 2004, found that its own case-law was not in line with the European Court. It held that there was no legal barrier to awarding just satisfaction to “juristic” persons according to the criteria of the . Accordingly, since the Court of Appeal had correctly decided the case the appeal was dismissed. 30.The Court of Cassation made the following observations: “... [Whereas] non-pecuniary damage is the normal, albeit not automatic, consequence of a breach of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, it will be deemed to exist, without it being necessary to specifically prove it (directly or by presumption), on the basis of the objective fact of the breach, on condition that there are no special circumstances indicating the absence of any such damage in the actual case concerned (Cass. A.P. 26 January 2004 nos. 1338 and 1339). 31.In the report CM/Inf/DH(2004)23, revised on 24 September 2004, the Ministers’ deputies made the following indications regarding an assessment of the Pinto remedy: 32.In this interim resolution the Ministers’ deputies indicated as follows: “The Committee of Ministers Noting ... 33.The European Commission for the efficiency of justice was set up at the Council of Europe by Resolution Res(2002)12 with the aim of (a)improving the efficiency and the functioning of the justice of member States with a view to ensuring that everyone within their jurisdiction can enforce their legal rights effectively, thereby generating increased confidence of the citizens in the justice system and (b) enabling a better implementation of the international legal instruments of the Council of Europe concerning efficiency and fairness of justice. 34.In its framework programme (CEPEJ (2004) 19 Rev 2 § (7) the CEPEJ noted that “the mechanisms which are limited to compensation are too weak and do not adequately incite the States to modify their operational process, and provide compensation only a posteriori in the event of a proven violation instead of trying to find a solution for the problem of delays.”",2006,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

12,001-60638,Grand Chamber,"11.The applicants were born in 1960, 1950 and 1938 and live at Irigny, at Colombes and in Paris respectively. 12.The applicant was arrested on 15 April 1992 and charged by an investigating judge at Mâcon tribunal de grande instance with using a vehicle registration document that had been obtained illegally and handling a stolen vehicle. He was remanded in custody from 16 April to 18 May 1992. On 31 March 1994 he was committed to stand trial before the Mâcon Criminal Court. 13.In a judgment of 21 October 1994 the Mâcon Criminal Court dismissed the applicant's application to have the proceedings set aside as defective and, finding him guilty, imposed a suspended sentence of eight months' imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 French francs (FRF). The applicant appealed. 14.On 2 February 1995 the Dijon Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the Criminal Court in its entirety. The applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation. 15.By a judgment of 17 January 1996 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal. 16.On 5 November 1994 the applicant was caught by a speed trap while at the wheel of his vehicle. The gendarmerie reported him for exceeding the speed limit by at least 40 k.p.h., namely by driving at 143 k.p.h. in a 90k.p.h. speed-limit zone. 17.On 14 March 1995 the Melle Police Court found him guilty of the offence, and imposed a fine of FRF 1,500 and banned him from driving for twenty-one days. 18.On 15 December 1995 the Poitiers Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, and increased the fine to FRF 3,000 and the ban to three months. 19.By a judgment of 6 August 1996 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant's appeal. 20.On 11 November 1994 the police reported the applicant for two offences of failing to stop at a red traffic light. He was summoned to appear at the Paris Police Court for a hearing on 8 March 1995. 21.On 12 April 1995 the Paris Police Court found the applicant guilty of the offences. It imposed two fines of FRF 1,800 each and banned him from driving for one month. 22.On 27 October 1995 the Paris Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the Police Court in its entirety. On 2 November 1995 the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation. He sought communication of the advocate-general's written submissions in order to be able to reply to them, but to no avail. 23.By a judgment of 10 July 1996 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant's appeal. 24.The relevant provisions, as worded at the material time, read as follows: Article 567 “Judgments of indictment divisions and judgments of the criminal courts against which no ordinary appeal lies may, in the event of a breach of the law, be set aside on an appeal on points of law to the Court of Cassation lodged by the public prosecutor or by the party adversely affected, according to the distinctions made hereafter. The appeal must be lodged with the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation.” Article 584 “Appellants in the Court of Cassation may lodge a pleading bearing their signature and containing the grounds of their appeal with the registry of the court against whose judgment they are appealing either when giving notice of appeal or within the following ten days. The registrar shall issue them with a receipt.” Article 585 “After the expiry of that time-limit, convicted appellants may send their pleading directly to the Court of Cassation; the other parties may not avail themselves of this provision without being represented by a member of the Court of Cassation Bar. ...” Article 585-1 “Save where the President of the Criminal Division decides otherwise, convicted appellants shall lodge their pleading with the registry of the Court of Cassation no later than one month from the date of the notice of appeal. The same rule shall apply to notices of acting lodged by lawyers representing an appellant in the Court of Cassation.” Article 590 “The pleadings shall contain the grounds of appeal and cite the legal provisions that are alleged to have been infringed. ... They must be lodged within the prescribed time-limit. No further pleadings may be added to them once the reporting judge has filed his report. Any pleading setting out additional grounds that is lodged out of time may be declared inadmissible.” Article 602 “The reports shall be presented at the hearing. The parties' lawyers shall make their observations after the report, if appropriate. The public prosecutor shall make his or her submissions.” 25.Current practice is for the advocate-general to inform the parties' lawyers before the day of the hearing of the tenor of his or her submissions and in cases where, at the request of the lawyers, there is an oral hearing, they are entitled to reply to his or her submissions orally or by a note sent to the court in deliberations (see Reinhardt and Slimane-Kaïd v. France, judgment of 31 March 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II, p. 666, § 106). 26.In cases in which representation by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar is not compulsory, an ordinance of 15 January 1826, Article 15 of which has not been repealed, lays down that the parties may make oral representations with the permission of the Court of Cassation. On the basis of the ordinance of 1826 the Court of Cassation accepts that it is possible for it to give the parties leave to address it, or for a member of the ordinary bar to speak on their behalf. Although it is for the Court of Cassation to decide whether or not to grant permission according to the circumstances (Court of Cassation, Criminal Division, 3 May 1990, Bull. crim. [Criminal Bulletin] no. 166), it appears that its practice is to refuse such applications (see the period 1990 to 2001 and the judgments available on the Légifrance Internet site) in terms similar to the following: “Regard being had to Article 37 of the Ordinance of 15 January 1826, which has not been repealed in so far as it concerns the procedure applicable before the Criminal Division; as [the appellant] has set out his grounds of appeal against the impugned decision in a pleading which he has lodged in person, his appearance in person before the Criminal Division does not appear to be either necessary or appropriate; it is not necessary to order it.” (judgment of 15 December 1999, appeal on points of law no. 99-80015) 27.As regards more particularly cases involving road-traffic offences (such as parking or speeding offences), there have been numerous decisions in which applications made by members of the ordinary bar have been turned down, the Court of Cassation holding as in the following decision: “[The appellant] has requested permission to appear before the Court of Cassation assisted by Mr [...], a member of the Paris Bar [...]. As [the appellant] has set out his grounds of appeal against the impugned decision in a pleading which he has lodged in person, his appearance in person before the Criminal Division does not appear to be essential.” (judgment of 16 May 2001, appeal on points of lawno.0086011) 28.Indeed, the Government acknowledge that such permission is rarely granted, the principle being that the members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar have a monopoly on making oral representations. They must consult the President of the Criminal Division beforehand regarding the ground of appeal on points of law for which they consider oral representations to be necessary. In 2001 oral representations were only made in some 40 or so appeals out of a total of 9,637 that were heard. 29.The members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar are the successors to the King's Bench attorneys, who practised during the Ancien Régime. Rights of audience before the King's Bench were reserved to attorneys who were royal officers and owned their official appointment (charge) from 1643 onwards. By the time of the Revolution in 1789 there were seventy-three attorneys at the King's Bench. The Revolution brought their activities to an end. They became counsel at the Tribunal of Cassation that was created in 1790, and subsequently, in 1804, members of the Court of Cassation Bar. Another group of lawyers practised at the Conseil d'Etat. The two groups were merged by an ordinance of 10 September 1817. That ordinance, which for many years served as the Bar Council Charter, was amended by a decree of 28 October 1991 (which codified the conditions of access to the profession and has since undergone a number of subsequent amendments; see also the law of 20 March 1948, which made women eligible to enter the profession, and the decree of 15 March 1978, allowing lawyers to practise in professional partnerships). The existence of a specialised bar is peculiar to France and Belgium (where only members of the Court of Cassation Bar belong to a separate bar council). 30.Members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, unlike members of the ordinary bar, are ministerial officers. The number of official appointees has been irrevocably set at sixty since 1817. The conditions of access require in principle the candidate to be a practising lawyer, to have undergone special training and to have passed a professional entrance examination organised by the Bar Council (the legislation nevertheless provides for a number of exemptions and special means of access). Appointments are made by order of the Minister of Justice, on the basis of a reasoned opinion issued by the Bar Council, the Vice-President of the Conseil d'Etat and the President of the Court of Cassation. 31.In proceedings before the Court of Cassation, representation by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar is in principle compulsory, particularly in civil proceedings, unless an exemption is obtained. Members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar cannot represent the parties before the lower courts (although they may give advice and appear before the administrative courts of appeal and administrative courts). In proceedings before the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation they are required to consult with the President of the Criminal Division before the hearing if they wish to make oral representations, in order to explain the points of law they wish to make orally and to determine by agreement the arrangements under which they will be allowed to do so. 32.Directive 98/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 to facilitate practice of the profession of lawyer on a permanent basis in a member State other than that in which the qualification was obtained provides, inter alia, at Article 5 § 3, sub-paragraph 2: “... in order to ensure the smooth operation of the justice system, member States may lay down specific rules for access to supreme courts, such as the use of specialist lawyers” (see also Court of Justice of the European Communities, 7 November 2000, Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, Case no.168/98).",2002,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

160,001-61629,Grand Chamber,"8.The applicant was born in 1933 and lives in La Plaine des Cafres ().>On 31 July 1995 she went to the gendarmerie in La Plaine des Cafres to file a complaint of having been assaulted by her two children. She said that her children had come to see her about a lawsuit between them concerning the non-payment of maintenance to which she was entitled because of her ill-health. While the applicant was in the front passenger seat of a motor car driven by her daughter, her son, who was in the back, had allegedly immobilised her and used a syringe to inject her twice with an unknown substance. She said she had quickly got out of the car and gone to hospital. 10.The applicant was found to have marks of injections. Moreover, after a witness had come forward, the gendarmes found a syringe which when tested was found to bear traces of diazepam and benzoic acid, both of which also form part of the chemical make-up of valium. 11.An investigation was begun on the grounds of assault with an offensive weapon resulting in total unfitness for work for more than eight days (reduced to less than that during the investigation). 12.During the investigation, the applicant joined the proceedings as a civil party. 13.On 14 March 1997 the Saint-Pierre investigating judge ruled that there was no case to answer on the ground that there was insufficient evidence that anyone had committed the offence. He found that the applicant's son, “who had allegedly given her the injection, had left the département to return to his dental practice abroad, in Gabon”, that “he had given his mother an injection of a substance which was medically harmless at that dosage...” and “that, in the absence of precise information as to his address, it did not [seem] practicable to interview [the son] given the difficulty of enforcing any request for evidence to be taken on oath in Gabon”. The decision was apparently served on the applicant on the same day by registered post with acknowledgment of receipt. 14.On 7 April 1997 the applicant went to the investigating judge's registry and, claiming that she had not received a copy of the decision, refused to sign the notice of appeal drafted by the registrar. She asserted that she had drafted a personal notice of appeal and lodged it at the registry on that same day. In her written observations to the court of appeal, the applicant requested, inter alia, that the investigating judge be made to stand down, that the investigation be resumed, that it be formally recorded that “her complaint [related to] premeditated assault with an offensive weapon resulting in thirty days' total unfitness for work and, given the results of the tests on the syringe, with criminal intent”, and that her children be “brought to the département by force in order to explain themselves”. 15.By a judgment of 8 July 1997, the Indictment Division of the Court of Appeal of Saint-Denis-de-la-Réunion found that the applicant had appealed “by letter addressed to and received on 7 April 1997 by the investigating judge's registry”, and that she had gone to the registry on the same day and refused to sign the notice of appeal. The Indictment Division therefore ruled that her appeal was inadmissible on the grounds that she had missed the legal deadline and had failed to sign the notice of appeal. 16.On 11 July 1997 the applicant appealed on points of law. On 21 July 1997 she filed personal observations in which she submitted that the Court of Appeal had, in its judgment of 8 July 1997, disregarded certain provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure: firstly, “the judgment did not meet the essential conditions required for it to be lawful”, having been given by “judges who had not attended all the hearings in the case” and, secondly, the grounds set out in the impugned judgment relating to service of the decision that there was no case to answer were “insufficient” because they did not address the arguments she had put forward at the hearing. She alleged that there had been a breach of Articles 592, 575-6, 593 and 646 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 17.In a judgment of 21 April 1998, the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed her appeal in the following terms: “ ... Given the personal written observations filed; On the sole ground of appeal, based on a breach of Articles 485 and 183 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; Whereas, firstly, the particulars of the judgment under appeal establish that it was given in the conditions prescribed by Article 485, third paragraph, of the Code of Criminal Procedure; Whereas, secondly, the Court of Appeal was correct in finding that the appeal of 7April 1997 against the decision that there was no case to answer served on 14 March 1997 was out of time in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 183 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; ...” 18.The relevant provisions are as follows: Article 1382 “Any act that causes damage to another shall render the person through whose fault the damage was caused liable to make reparation for it.” Article 1383 “Everyone shall be liable for the damage he has caused not only by his own acts, but also by his negligence or carelessness.” Article 1384, first paragraph “Everyone shall be liable not only for the damage caused by his own act but also for that caused by persons for whom he is responsible or by things he has in his keeping.” 19.The relevant provisions are as follows: Preliminary Article “ – Criminal proceedings shall be fair and provide for all parties to be heard and shall maintain a balance between the rights of the parties. ... I – The courts shall ensure that victims are kept informed and their rights safeguarded during any criminal proceedings. ...” Article 1 “Public prosecutions for the punishment of offenders shall be brought and conducted by officers of the State legal service or by those public officials empowered to do so by law. Such prosecutions may also be brought by the injured party, under the conditions laid down in this Code.” Article 2 “Anyone who has personally suffered damage directly caused by a criminal offence may bring civil-party proceedings to seek compensation for such damage. Discontinuance of such proceedings shall neither terminate nor stay the public prosecution ...” Article 3 “Civil-party proceedings may be conducted simultaneously with the public prosecution and before the same court. Civil-party proceedings may be brought for any head of damage, whether pecuniary or physical or non-pecuniary, caused by the acts under prosecution.” Article 4 “Civil-party proceedings may also be conducted separately from the public prosecution. However, judgment in civil-party proceedings brought in a civil court shall be suspended until final judgment has been given in any public prosecution.” Article 5 “A party who has brought proceedings in a civil court may not refer the same complaint to a criminal court unless the prosecution has preferred charges in that court before the civil court has ruled on the merits.” Article 81-1 “An investigating judge may, of his own motion, on the instructions of the prosecuting authorities or at the request of the civil party, do anything lawful to enable him to assess the nature and extent of the damage suffered by the victim or to gather information about the victim's personality.” Article 82-1 “The parties may, during the investigation, submit a written and reasoned request to the investigating judge that they be interviewed or questioned, that a witness be heard, that a confrontation be arranged or that they be taken to the scene of the crime, that one of them be ordered to produce an item relevant to the investigation, or that any other action be taken which they believe is necessary for uncovering the truth. In order to be valid, such a request must comply with the provisions of the tenth paragraph of Article 81; it must relate to specific actions and, where it relates to an interview, must identify the person sought to be interviewed.” Article 85 “Anyone who claims to have suffered damage as a result of a serious crime [crime] or other serious offence [délit] may, by lodging a criminal complaint, join the criminal proceedings as a civil party on application to the appropriate investigating judge.” Article 87, first paragraph “A civil-party application may be made at any time during the investigation.” Article 88 “The investigating judge shall record in an order the lodging of the complaint. According to the civil party's means, he shall determine the amount of security for costs which that party must, if he has not obtained legal aid, deposit at the registry and the time-limit for doing so if the complaint is not to be declared inadmissible. He may exempt the civil party from paying security.” Article 186, second paragraph “A civil party may appeal against decisions not to begin or to discontinue the investigation and against orders that harm his civil interests. ...” Article 418 “Anyone who, in accordance with Article 2, claims to have suffered damage caused by a criminal offence may, if he has not already done so, lodge a civil-party complaint at the hearing itself. Representation by a lawyer is not mandatory. A civil party may, in support of his complaint, file a claim for damages in the amount of the loss he has suffered.” Article 419 “A civil party shall lodge his complaint either prior to the hearing at the registry or during the hearing itself by making a declaration recorded by the registrar or by filing pleadings.” Article 420-1 “... With the consent of the public prosecutor, the victim may also file a claim during the police investigation for restitution or damages by making a formal statement recorded by a police officer. Such a claim shall count as a civil-party complaint if it is decided to prosecute and the case is referred directly to a criminal or police court. ... In the event of a dispute over the ownership of the objects whose restitution is requested or where the court does not find sufficient reasons for a decision in the claim itself, the supporting documents or the file, the decision on the civil claim shall be adjourned to a later hearing to which all parties shall be summoned by the prosecution.” 20.Articles 2-1 to 2-19 concern the exercise of civil-party rights by associations or public-law entities. 21.In order for a civil-party complaint to be admissible, it is sufficient if the circumstances on which it is based permit the investigating judge to accept the possibility that the alleged damage may have occurred and that there may be a direct link between that damage and the commission of an offence (see, inter alia: judgments of the Court of Cassation, Criminal Division (“Cass. crim.”), 9 February 1961, Dalloz, 1961, p. 306; 5 March 1990, Bulletin criminel (“Bull. crim.”) no. 103; 11 January 1996, Bull. crim. no. 16; 8 June 1999, Bull. crim. no. 123; 6 September 2000, Bull. crim. no.263). The investigating judge must determine whether the complainant can establish a “possible” interest in lodging the complaint, and not find a civil-party application inadmissible on purely abstract grounds for lack of such an interest (Cass. crim., 6 February 1996, Bull. crim. no. 60). A decision by the investigating judge that a civil-party application is inadmissible does not prevent the party in question from lodging a further complaint with the trial court (Cass. crim., 15 May 1997, Bull. crim. no.185). 22.The Court of Cassation considers that a civil party is free not to exercise his right to claim compensation for his losses (Cass. crim., 10October 1968, Bull. crim. no. 248; 19 October 1982, Bull. crim. no. 222). 23.Even where compensation for losses falls outside the competence of the criminal courts, a civil-party application is admissible in so far as it assists in proving the offence (Cass. crim., 10 February 1987, Bull. crim. no.64). 24.“Civil proceedings must await the outcome of criminal proceedings” (Article 4 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The civil court must suspend judgment until the criminal court has issued a final ruling in the prosecution. The prosecution must be brought before or during the civil trial. The two sets of proceedings must be based on the same facts, even though the purpose, case and parties do not have to be identical. An application for a suspension must be made to the civil judge, and may be made for the first time at the appeal stage or before the Court of Cassation. Once ordered, a stay is binding on both the civil court and the parties until a final decision has been made in the prosecution, failing which the civil proceedings are null and void. 25.“A final criminal judgment prevails over a civil claim.” A civil court is bound by the final decision in a prosecution. The primacy of a decision in a criminal case is not prescribed by law in the strict sense but derives from case-law. It is an absolute rule, binding not only on the parties to the criminal trial but also on third parties. As application of the rule is not mandatory on public policy grounds, this rule cannot be relied on by the prosecution or by the judge of his own motion. Decisions by investigating judges are not binding on the civil courts. Accordingly, the only criminal decisions which are binding are the final and irrevocable decisions of the trial courts. Moreover a civil court is bound only by “findings of a criminal nature”: a civil court hearing a civil case will be bound by an acquittal, but not by that part of the criminal court's decision which deals with a claim for damages. Such “findings”, namely the reasons and the operative part, must be “certain” (which excludes findings expressed in doubtful or uncertain terms, except for acquittals “for lack of evidence” which are binding on a civil court) and “necessary” (what the judge must find to justify his decision – the elements of the offence, its classification, the aggravating circumstances which determine such classification, and the finding of guilt or not as the case may be). Generally speaking, the reasons do not have the same binding effect as the operative part unless they form its essential underpinning. 26.Recommendation No. R (83) 7 on participation of the public in crime policy, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 23 June 1983, advocates the establishment of an efficient system of legal aid for victims so that they may have access to justice in all circumstances. 27.Recommendation No. R (85) 11 on the position of the victim in the framework of criminal law and procedure, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 28 June 1985, provides: “ ...>The victim should be informed of –the date and place of a hearing concerning an offence which caused him suffering; –his opportunities of obtaining restitution and compensation within the criminal justice process, legal assistance and advice; –how he can find out the outcome of the case; 10.It should be possible for a criminal court to order compensation by the offender to the victim. To that end, existing limitations, restrictions or technical impediments which prevent such a possibility from being generally realised should be abolished; 11.Legislation should provide that compensation may either be a penal sanction, or a substitute for a penal sanction or be awarded in addition to a penal sanction; 12.All relevant information concerning the injuries and losses suffered by the victim should be made available to the court in order that it may, when deciding upon the form and the quantum of the sentence, take into account: –the victim's need for compensation; –any compensation or restitution made by the offender or any genuine effort to that end; 13.In cases where the possibilities open to a court include attaching financial conditions to the award of a deferred or suspended sentence, of a probation order or of any other measure, great importance should be given among these conditions to compensation by the offender to the victim; ...” 28.Recommendation No. R (87) 21 on assistance to victims and the prevention of victimisation, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 17September 1987, “recommends that the governments of member States take the following measures”: “...>ensure that victims and their families, especially those who are most vulnerable, receive in particular: ... –assistance during the criminal process, with due respect to the defence; ...” 29.Recommendation Rec(2000)19 on the role of public prosecution in the criminal justice system, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 6October 2000, provides: “ ... 34.Interested parties of recognised or identifiable status, in particular victims, should be able to challenge decisions of public prosecutors not to prosecute; such a challenge may be made, where appropriate after an hierarchical review, either by way of judicial review, or by authorising parties to engage private prosecution.”",2004,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

100,001-59591,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicant is the monarch of Liechtenstein, born in 1945 and living in Vaduz (Liechtenstein). 10.The applicant’s late father, the former monarch of Liechtenstein, had been the owner of the painting Szene an einem römischen Kalkofen (alias Der große Kalkofen) of Pieter van Laer, which had formed part of his family’s art collection since at least 1767. Until the end of the Second World War the painting had been in one of the family’s castles on the territory of the now Czech Republic. 11.In 1946 the former Czechoslovakia confiscated the property of the applicant’s father which was situated in its territory, including the painting in question, under Decree no. 12 on the “confiscation and accelerated allocation of agricultural property of German and Hungarian persons and of those having committed treason and acted as enemies of the Czech and Slovak people” (dekretu prezidenta republiky č. 12/1945 Sb. o konfiskaci a urychleném rozdělení majetku Němců, Mad’arů, zrádců a nepřátel), issued by the President of the former Czechoslovakia on 21 June 1945 (“the Beneš Decrees” – “Benešovy dekrety”). 12.On 21 November 1951 the Bratislava Administrative Court (správní soud) dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicant’s father. In its reasoning on the merits of the case, the Administrative Court stated that the defendant office had come to the conclusion that the appellant was a person of German nationality within the meaning of the provision in Article1 § 1 (a) of the decree, on the basis of a finding that this was and had been generally known. It noted that the defence of the complaint directed against this finding was restricted to the representation that this finding was not supported in the files and that, due to this shortcoming, it had not been necessary to deal with the finding in greater detail. The Administrative Court considered that this approach was mistaken as, under the relevant provision of the administrative regulations, no evidence was required for facts which were generally known and, therefore, it was not necessary for evidence to be contained in the administrative files; however, counter-evidence against an official finding that a certain fact was generally known would have been admitted. The Administrative Court concluded that, as the appellant had failed to raise the objection that the issue was not a fact of general knowledge and to contend that he was in a position to bring counter-evidence, the finding of the defendant office had remained uncontested. 13.In 1991 the municipality of Cologne obtained the painting as a temporary loan from the Brno Historical Monuments Office in the Czech Republic. 14.On 11 November 1991 the Cologne Regional Court (Landgericht) granted the applicant’s request for an interim injunction ordering the municipality of Cologne to hand over the painting to a bailiff at the end of the exhibition. The painting was sequestrated on 17 December 1991. 15.At the beginning of 1992 the applicant instituted proceedings before the Cologne Regional Court against the municipality of Cologne, requesting that the defendant consent to the delivery of the painting to him by the bailiff. He argued that, as his late father’s heir, he was the owner of the painting. He submitted that the painting had not been subject to expropriation measures in the former Czechoslovakia and that in any event such measures were invalid or irrelevant on account of violation of the ordre public of the Federal Republic of Germany. 16.The Brno Historical Monuments Office intervened in these proceedings in support of the defendant. It submitted that the applicant’s father had lost his ownership of the painting as a result of the confiscation in 1946 and that the lawfulness of this confiscation had been confirmed by the Bratislava Administrative Court in its decision of 21 November 1951. 17.On 10 October 1995 the Cologne Regional Court, following a hearing, declared the applicant’s action inadmissible. In the court’s view, Chapter 6, Article 3, of the Convention on the Settlement of Matters Arising out of the War and the Occupation (Vertrag zur Regelung aus Krieg und Besatzung entstandener Fragen – “the Settlement Convention”) of 23October 1954 between the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the French Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany excluded German jurisdiction over the applicant’s case. In its reasoning, the Regional Court noted that, under the terms of that Article’s paragraph 3 taken in conjunction with paragraph 1, claims or actions against persons having acquired or transferred title to property on the basis of measures carried out with regard to German external assets or other property, seized for the purpose of reparation or restitution, or as a result of the state of war, or on the basis of specific agreements, were not admissible. These particular provisions had been confirmed upon German unification. According to the Regional Court, Chapter 6, Article 3 § 3, of the Settlement Convention applied, mutatis mutandis, to the applicant’s claims against the defendant, which had obtained the painting on loan and had not acquired property, because any review of the aforementioned measures should be excluded. The Regional Court found that the confiscation of the applicant’s father’s property under Decree no. 12 on the “confiscation and accelerated allocation of agricultural property of German and Hungarian persons and of those having committed treason and acted as enemies of the Czech and Slovak people”, issued by the President of the former Czechoslovakia on 21 June 1945, constituted a measure within the meaning of Chapter 6, Article3 § 3. The Regional Court rejected, in particular, the applicant’s argument that this provision did not apply as it only concerned measures carried out with regard to German external assets or other property and his father had never been a German citizen. In this respect, the court, referring to case-law of the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), stated that the view of the confiscating State was decisive. The aim and purpose of this provision, namely to sanction, without any further examination, confiscation measures implemented abroad could only be achieved by excluding such measures from judicial review in Germany. Moreover, the Regional Court found that the confiscation measure in question pursued one of the purposes mentioned in Chapter 6, Article 3 § 3. Having regard to German case-law regarding other “Beneš Decrees”, especially Decree no. 108 on the “confiscation of enemy property and the national reform fund”, it considered that Decree no. 12, while also pursuing economic aims, was intended to expropriate the property of German and Hungarian nationals, that is, “enemy property”. The Regional Court further noted that the applicant’s father’s painting had been expropriated under Decree no. 12. The competent Czechoslovakian authorities had interpreted its provisions as applying to the applicant’s father, regarding him as a “person of German nationality”. The applicant’s father had unsuccessfully appealed against this decision which had been confirmed by the Bratislava Administrative Court in 1951. The German courts were not in a position to review the lawfulness of the confiscation at issue. Finally, the Regional Court considered that the painting at issue, as part of the inventory of the agricultural property, had been included in the confiscation measure. The Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s request to suspend the proceedings in order to await the outcome of proceedings to be instituted under the German Equalisation of Burdens Act (Lastenausgleichsgesetz) concerning compensation for damage and losses due to, inter alia, expulsion and destruction during the Second World War and the post-war period in the then Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and of Berlin. The Regional Court considered that the question underlying the litigation before it would not be clarified in such proceedings. Irrespective of the question of whether the plaintiff was of German origin, he had no equalisation claims under the said legislation, which only applied to persons who resided in the Federal Republic of Germany or West Berlin on 31 December 1952. In any event, there was no right to compensation for the loss of works of art (Kunstgegenstände). 18.On 9 July 1996 the Cologne Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The Court of Appeal confirmed that the applicant’s action was inadmissible as German jurisdiction in respect of his claim was excluded under Chapter 6, Article 3 § 1, in conjunction with paragraph 3, of the Settlement Convention. The Court of Appeal considered that the notion of German jurisdiction included the competence, derived from State sovereignty and generally vested by the State in the courts, to administer justice. German jurisdiction was delimited by international agreements, customary international law and the generally recognised rules of international law. Chapter 6, Article 3 § 3, taken in conjunction with paragraph 1, of the Settlements Convention excluded German jurisdiction in respect of claims and actions against persons, who, as a consequence of reparation measures, had directly or indirectly acquired title to German property confiscated abroad. The Court of Appeal confirmed that the provisions in question continued to be in force under the Treaty of 12 September 1990 on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany. Article 7 of this Treaty, which provided for the termination of the operation of quadripartite rights and responsibilities with respect to Berlin and Germany as a whole, was amended by the Agreement of 27 and 28 September 1990 according to which the Settlement Convention was suspended and later terminated with the exception of the provisions specified in paragraph 3 of that Agreement, inter alia, Chapter 6, Article 3 §§ 1 and 3. That Agreement was valid under public international law and under German constitutional law. The Court of Appeal further considered that Chapter 6, Article 3 § 3, of the Settlement Convention applied in the applicant’s case. In the court’s view, this provision was the procedural consequence of the notion that the legal relations resulting from the liquidation of German property abroad by foreign powers for the purpose of reparation were “final and unchallengeable” (Endgültigkeit und Unanfechtbarkeit) for the Federal Republic of Germany and the private persons concerned. According to the Court of Appeal, the applicant’s constitutional rights, in particular his right to property, his right of access to a court and his right to a decision by the legally competent court (gesetzlicher Richter), had not been infringed. Basic rights protected individuals against acts of domestic public authorities and not against the exercise of public authority by a foreign State abroad. The domestic legislator was therefore not prevented from limiting domestic legal protection against violations of basic rights by a foreign State if this was necessary to attain more important goals. When applying Chapter 6, Article 3 § 3, of the Settlement Convention, the domestic law of the expropriating State concerning the concrete confiscation measure had to be taken into account, as this provision was aimed at excluding litigation in Germany regarding confiscation measures based on legislation concerning enemy property. As regards the applicant’s objections against the lawfulness, in particular under public international law, of the confiscation and expropriation of his father’s property, the Court of Appeal found that by virtue of Chapter 6, Article 3 § 3 of the Settlement Convention, German courts had no jurisdiction. Likewise, this provision did not allow recourse to be had to general rules of public international law or to German ordre public when examining the admissibility of the action. The applicant’s argument that the provisions of the Settlement Convention and their application to him as a national and head of a neutral State violated the law of peace was accordingly rejected. According to the Court of Appeal, the painting at issue constituted external assets within the meaning of Chapter 6, Article 3 § 1, of the Settlement Convention, referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 3. The Court of Appeal noted that the applicant’s father had indisputably never had German nationality. However, following the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, it considered that the notion of “German external assets” had to be interpreted in the light of the law of the expropriating State. The confiscation in dispute had been found to be in compliance with the legislation of the expropriating State: the competent Czechoslovakian administrative authorities as well as the Bratislava Administrative Court had found that Presidential Decree no. 12 of 21 June 1945 applied to the applicant’s father’s confiscated property. Article 1 § 1 (a) of this decree provided for the confiscation of agricultural properties of “all persons of German or Hungarian nationality” irrespective of their citizenship. The notions of “German nationality”, or of “German origin” (“deutsche Volkszugehörigkeit”), likewise used at that time, comprised as relevant elements a person’s citizenship and nationality, the latter depending on the mother tongue. At the relevant time, the Czechoslovakian authorities indisputably regarded the applicant’s father as of German origin in that broader sense. The Court of Appeal also found that the painting at issue, as part of the confiscated agricultural property, had been subject to the expropriation measure. There were no doubts as to the effectiveness of the expropriation, as it was sufficient under the relevant case-law that such expropriations had been implemented and that the previous owners had been deprived of their factual power of disposition. Furthermore, the painting had been confiscated for the purpose of reparation within the meaning of Chapter 6, Article 3 §§1 and 3, of the Settlement Agreement. The limitation of the confiscation measures to persons belonging to enemy States in itself justified such a conclusion. The assets of the persons concerned were confiscated as enemy assets. Finally, the Court of Appeal considered that both the defendant and the intervener belonged to the group of persons protected by Chapter 6, Article3 § 3, of the Settlement Agreement. German jurisdiction was excluded whenever the plaintiff intended to challenge measures within the meaning of Chapter 6, Article 3 § 1. 19.On 25 September 1997 the Federal Court of Justice refused to entertain the applicant’s appeal on points of law, as the case was of no fundamental importance and, in any event, had no prospect of success. 20.On 28 January 1998 the Third Section of the Second Division (3. Kammer des zweiten Senats) of the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) refused to entertain the applicant’s constitutional complaint (Verfassungsbeschwerde), as it offered no prospect of success. The Federal Constitutional Court considered in particular that, for the purposes of the civil court decisions, questions as to the existence or non-existence of certain rules of customary international law on the confiscation of neutral assets or on the determination of citizenship were irrelevant as they concerned the issue of the lawfulness of the expropriation by the former Czechoslovakia. The German civil courts had not decided this issue and, under public international law, they had not been obliged to do so. Moreover, to the extent that the civil courts had regarded the expropriation as a measure within the meaning of Chapter 6, Article 3 § 1, of the Settlement Convention, they had expressly refrained from qualifying the applicant’s father’s nationality. Their interpretation of the terms “measures with regard to German external assets” as comprising any measures which, in the intention of the expropriating State, were directed against German assets, could not be objected to under constitutional law. The bar on litigation did not constitute an agreement to the detriment of Liechtenstein, as only the Federal Republic of Germany and its courts were under this treaty obligation. The Federal Constitutional Court further recalled that the exclusion of jurisdiction did not amount to a violation of the right of property as these clauses and the Settlement Convention as a whole served to settle matters dating back to a time before the entry into force of the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz) on 23 May 1949. Finally, there was no indication of arbitrariness or of a violation of other constitutional rights. The Federal Constitutional Court confirmed that Chapter 6, Article 3 §§ 1 and 3, of the Settlement Convention had not been set aside by the Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany: while Germany obtained full sovereignty, its obligations under treaties with the Three Powers were not affected. This had also been the legal opinion of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Three Powers, which otherwise would not have settled the suspension and termination of parts of the Settlement Convention in a separate agreement. The decision was served on 2 February 1998. 21.On 9 June 1998 the Cologne Regional Court discharged its interim injunction of 11 November 1991. The bailiff thereupon handed the painting over to the Cologne municipality, which had it returned to the Czech Republic. 22.Beneš Decree no. 12 on the “confiscation and accelerated allocation of agricultural property of German and Hungarian persons and of those having committed treason and acted as enemies of the Czech and Slovak people” provided for the expropriation, with immediate effect and without compensation, of agricultural property, for the purposes of land reform. It concerned agricultural property, including, inter alia, buildings and movable goods on such property, in the ownership of all persons of German and Hungarian nationality irrespective of their citizenship status. According to Article 2 of the said decree, those persons were to be considered as German or Hungarian nationals who, in any census since 1929, had declared to be of German or Hungarian nationality, or who had become members of national groups, formations or political parties which had been made up of persons of German or Hungarian nationality. 23. After the German capitulation of 8 May 1945, the Four Powers had assumed supreme authority in Germany, as stated in the Allied Declaration of 5 June 1945 (Declaration regarding the defeat of Germany and the assumption of supreme authority with respect to Germany by the Governments of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and the Provisional Government of the French Republic, United Nations Treaty Series, vol. 68, pp. 190 et seq.). The supreme military commanders of the four Allied Forces administered their respective zones and dealt jointly, through the Inter-Allied Control Council, with all matters relating to the country as a whole, namely military matters, transport, finance, economic affairs, reparations, justice, prisoners of war, communications, law and order, as well as political affairs. 24.The Convention on the Settlement of Matters Arising out of the War and the Occupation (“the Settlement Convention – see paragraph 17 above) is one of the “Bonn Conventions” (Bonner Verträge) signed by France, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany at Bonn on 26 May 1952, and designed to end the Occupation Regime. The other Bonn Conventions were: –the Convention on Relations between the Three Powers and the Federal Republic of Germany (“the Relations Convention”); –the Convention on the Rights and Obligations of Foreign Forces and their Members in the Federal Republic of Germany; –the Finance Convention. 25.The Bonn Conventions as such did not enter into force, but were amended in accordance with the five Schedules to the Protocol on the Termination of the Occupation Regime in the Federal Republic of Germany, one of the “Paris Agreements”, which were signed in Paris on 23 October 1954. 26.Article 1 of Schedule I which amends the above-mentioned Relations Convention states that the Three Powers will terminate the Occupation Regime in Western Germany, revoke the Occupation Statute, and abolish the offices of the Land Commissioners. The Federal Republic of Germany is accorded “the full authority of a sovereign State over its internal and external affairs”. According to Article 2, the Three Powers retain their rights “relating to Berlin and to Germany as a whole, including the reunification of Germany and a peace settlement”. 27.The above-mentioned Paris Agreements comprise: (1)documents signed by France and the Federal Republic of Germany, relating to disputes between the two States (the resolution of cultural, economic and other difficulties) and to the Saar; (2)documents signed at the so-called Four-Power Conference by France, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany, relating to German sovereignty and including in particular: –the above-mentioned Protocol on the Termination of the Occupation Regime in the Federal Republic of Germany and the five Schedules thereto (amending the Relations Convention, the Settlement Convention and the other Bonn Conventions), as well as letters dealing with specific points in the Bonn Conventions; –the Convention on the Presence of Foreign Forces in the Federal Republic of Germany (in this context, mention should be made of the Tripartite Declaration on Berlin); (3)documents signed by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy, including the –Protocol Modifying and Completing the Brussels Treaty; –Protocol on the Forces of the Western European Union; –Protocol on the Control of Armaments: –Protocol on the Agency of the Western European Union for the Control of Armaments; –Resolution on the Production and Standardisation of Armaments; (4)documents signed by the fourteen countries party to the North Atlantic Treaty: –Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty on the Accession of the Federal Republic of Germany; –Resolution by the North Atlantic Council to implement Section IV of the Final Act of the London Conference; –Resolution on the results of the Four- and Nine-Power Conferences; –Resolution of Association taking note of the obligations accepted by the Federal Republic on the signature of the London Agreements and of the declaration relating to such obligations. 28.Under the general provisions of the Settlement Convention (Federal Gazette – Bundesgesetzblatt II, 31 March 1955, pp. 405 et seq.), as amended by Schedule IV to the Protocol on the Termination of the Occupation Regime (see paragraph 25 above), the federal and the Land authorities were given powers to repeal or amend legislation enacted by the Occupation Authorities. However, in many other respects, the status quo was confirmed. In particular, rights and obligations created or established by or under legislative, administrative or judicial action of the Occupation Authorities remained valid for all purposes under German law. The same applied to rights and obligations arising under treaties or international agreements which had been concluded on behalf of the three Western Zones of Occupation by the Occupation Authorities or by the governments of the Three Powers. Furthermore, there was a bar on prosecution of persons by action of German courts or authorities on the ground of having sympathised with, aided or supplied information or services to the Three Powers or their Allies. German courts and authorities had as a rule no jurisdiction in any criminal or non-criminal proceedings relating to an act or omission which had occurred before the date of entry into force of this convention, if immediately prior to such date German courts and authorities were without jurisdiction with respect to such act or omission whether ratione materiae or ratione personae. The finality (Rechtskraft), validity and enforceability of judgments and decisions in criminal or non-criminal matters rendered in Germany by tribunals or judicial authorities of the Three Powers or any of them were confirmed. 29.Chapter 6 of the Settlement Convention concerns reparation issues and the relevant parts of Article 3 provide as follows: “1.The Federal Republic of Germany shall in the future raise no objections against the measures which have been, or will be, carried out with regard to German external assets or other property, seized for the purpose of reparation or restitution, or as a result of the state of war, or on the basis of agreements concluded, or to be concluded, by the Three Powers with other Allied countries, neutral countries or former allies of Germany. ...>No claim or action shall be admissible against persons who shall have acquired or transferred title to property on the basis of the measures referred to in paragraph 1 ... of this Article, or against international organisations, foreign governments or persons who have acted upon instructions of such organisations or governments.” 30.At the eighteen-nation Paris Conference on Reparations in November and December 1945, the participating States, including Czechoslovakia, agreed on more detailed policies based upon the Potsdam undertakings (provisions agreed upon at Potsdam on 1 August 1945 between the governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) in order to obtain an equitable distribution among themselves of the total assets available as reparation from Germany, to establish an Inter-Allied Reparation Agency, and to settle an equitable procedure for the restitution of monetary gold. The Paris Agreement (Agreement on Reparation from Germany, on the Establishment of an Inter-Allied Reparation Agency, and on the Restitution of Monetary Gold of 14 January 1946, United Nations Treaty Series, vol.555, p. 69) established, inter alia, the shares which each country was to receive from German reparations. The Inter-Allied Reparation Agency, established in accordance with Part II of the Agreement, charged the reparation account of each signatory government for the German assets within that government’s jurisdiction and maintained detailed accounts of assets available for, and of assets distributed as, German reparation. 31.The Act on Losses due to Reparations of 12 February 1969 (Gesetz zur Abgeltung von Reparations-, Restitutions-, Zerstörungs- und Rückerstattungsschäden – Reparationsschädengesetz, Federal Gazette I, 1969, p. 105) was one of the statutes passed to deal with the consequences of the Second World War and the collapse of the National Socialist regime. 32.Section 2(1) of the Act provided a general definition of losses due to reparations, the relevant parts of which read as follows: “A loss due to reparations in the meaning of this Act is any loss, which occurred in the context of the events and consequences of the Second World War, including also the occupation regime, and resulted from the fact that economic goods were taken away>in currently occupied East German territories or in territories outside the German Reich on the basis of measures carried out by foreign States with regard to German assets, in particular on the basis of legislation on enemy property, ...” 33.Sections 11 to 16 laid down the conditions of compensation for losses. The Act was limited to losses suffered by natural persons (section13(1)). In case of losses which had occurred in the then occupied East German territories or in territories outside the German Reich, only German nationals or persons of German origin (deutscher Volkszugehöriger) who were, at the time of the occurrence of the loss, stateless or had only the nationality of a State where they had been subjected to expropriation or expulsion measures on account of their German origin could claim compensation (section 13(2)). Section 15 listed works of art and collections among the losses excluded from compensation. The time-limit for filing compensation claims under the Act expired on 31December 1974 (section 53). 34.During 1990, in parallel with internal German developments, the Four Powers (France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States) negotiated to end the reserved rights of the Four Powers for Berlin and Germany as a whole. The Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany (the so-called Two-Plus-Four Treaty) was eventually signed in Moscow on 12September 1990, and published in the Federal Gazette on 13 October 1990 (pp. 1308 et seq.). The Treaty confirms in particular the definite nature of the borders of the united Germany (Article 1). According to its Article 7, the rights and responsibilities of the Four Powers relating to Berlin and Germany as a whole terminated with the result that the corresponding, related quadripartite agreements, decisions and practices were terminated; and the united Germany was given full sovereignty over its internal and external affairs. The Treaty entered into force on 15 March 1991. 35.As regards the above-mentioned Relations Convention and Settlement Convention, as amended, an agreement was reached between the governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, the French Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America, following an exchange of notes on 27and 28 September 1990, which entered into force on the last-mentioned date (Federal GazetteII, 8 November 1990, pp. 1386 et seq.). This agreement provides, inter alia: “1.The Convention on Relations between the Three Powers and the Federal Republic of Germany of 26 May 1952 ... (“the Relations Convention”) shall be suspended upon the suspension of the operation of quadripartite rights and responsibilities with respect to Berlin and to Germany as a whole, and shall terminate upon the entry into force of the Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany, signed at Moscow on 12 September 1990.>Subject to paragraph 3 below, the Convention on the Settlement of Matters Arising out of the War and the Occupation of 26 May 1952 ... (“the Settlement Convention”) shall be suspended and shall terminate at the same time as the Relations Convention; ...>The following provisions of the Settlement Convention shall, however, remain in force: ... Chapter Six: Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 3 ...” 36.The political union of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic occurred on 3 October 1990, with the accession (in accordance with Article 23 of the Basic Law) of the five Länder which had been re-established in the German Democratic Republic. 37.The second chapter of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code (Einführungsgesetz zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch), as in force at the relevant time (as amended by the Act on the Reform of Private International Law – Gesetz zur Neuregelung des Internationalen Privatrechts, Federal Gazette I, 25 July 1986, p. 1142), contained statutory rules of German private international law relating to the rights of natural persons and the rules on legal transactions, family law and succession law. This legislation did not comprise statutory provisions on property matters and, before the entry into force of the 1999 Act on Private International Law (Gesetz zum internationalen Privatrecht für ausservertragliche Schuldverhältnisse und für Sachen, Federal Gazette I, 21 May 1999, p. 1026, amending Chapter 2 of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code), the German courts applied customary law, that is, as a rule the lex rei sitae. According to section 6 of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code, the legal provisions of a foreign State shall not be applied if their application would lead to a result incompatible with essential principles of German law (ordre public).",2001,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

175,001-99015,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicant was born in 1975 and is currently detained in Schwalmstadt Prison, Germany. 10.J. was the youngest son of a banking family in Frankfurt am Main. He got to know the applicant, a law student, as an acquaintance of his sister. 11.On 27 September 2002 the applicant lured J., aged 11, into his flat in Frankfurt am Main by pretending that the child’s sister had left a jacket there. He then killed the boy by suffocating him. 12.Subsequently, the applicant deposited a ransom note at J.’s parents’ place of residence stating that J. had been kidnapped and demanding onemillion euros. The note further stated that if the kidnappers received the ransom and managed to leave the country, then the child’s parents would see their son again. The applicant then drove to a pond located on a private property near Birstein, approximately one hour’s drive from Frankfurt, and hid J.’s corpse under a jetty. 13.On 30 September 2002 at around 1 a.m. the applicant picked up the ransom at a tram station. From then on he was under police surveillance. He paid part of the ransom money into his bank accounts and hid the remainder of the money in his flat. That afternoon, he was arrested at Frankfurt am Main airport with the police pinning him face down on the ground. 14.After having been examined by a doctor at the airport’s hospital on account of shock and skin lesions, the applicant was taken to the Frankfurt am Main police headquarters. He was informed by detective officer M. that he was suspected of having kidnapped J. and was instructed about his rights as a defendant, notably the right to remain silent and to consult a lawyer. He was then questioned by M. with a view to finding J. Meanwhile, the police, having searched the applicant’s flat, found half of the ransom money and a note concerning the planning of the crime. The applicant intimated that the child was being held by another kidnapper. At 11.30 p.m. he was allowed to consult a lawyer, Z., for thirty minutes at his request. He subsequently indicated that F.R. and M.R. had kidnapped the boy and had hidden him in a hut by a lake. 15.Early in the morning of 1 October 2002, before M. came to work, MrDaschner (“D.”), deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, ordered another officer, Mr Ennigkeit (“E.”), to threaten the applicant with considerable physical pain, and, if necessary, to subject him to such pain in order to make him reveal the boy’s whereabouts. D.’s subordinate heads of department had previously and repeatedly opposed such a measure (see also paragraph 47 below). Detective officer E. thereupon threatened the applicant with subjection to considerable pain at the hands of a person specially trained for such purposes if he did not disclose the child’s whereabouts. According to the applicant, the officer further threatened to lock him in a cell with two huge black men who would sexually abuse him. The officer also hit him several times on the chest with his hand and shook him so that, on one occasion, his head hit the wall. The Government disputed that the applicant had been threatened with sexual abuse or had been physically assaulted during the questioning. 16.For fear of being exposed to the measures he was threatened with, the applicant disclosed the whereabouts of J.’s body after approximately ten minutes. 17.The applicant was then driven with M. and numerous other police officers to Birstein. He had refused to go with detective officer E. The police waited for a video camera to be brought to the scene. Then, the applicant, on the communicated order of the police officer in command and while being filmed, pointed out the precise location of the body. The police found J.’s corpse under the jetty at the pond near Birstein as indicated by the applicant. The applicant claimed that he had been obliged to walk without shoes through woods to where he had left the corpse and, on the orders of the police, he had had to point out its precise location. The Government disputed that the applicant had had to walk without shoes. 18.Upon forensic examination of the scene, the police discovered tyre tracks left by the applicant’s car near the pond near Birstein. Under questioning by detective officer M. on the return journey from Birstein the applicant confessed to having kidnapped and killed J. He was then taken by the police to various other locations indicated by him where they secured J.’s school exercise books, a backpack, J.’s clothes and a typewriter used for the blackmail letter in containers. An autopsy carried out on J.’s corpse on 2October 2002 confirmed that J. had died of suffocation. 19.Having returned to the police station, the applicant was then permitted to consult his lawyer, En., who had been instructed to act on his behalf by his mother and who had tried, in vain, to contact and advise the applicant earlier that morning. 20.In a note for the police file dated 1 October 2002, the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., stated that he believed that that morning J.’s life had been in great danger, if he was still alive at all, given his lack of food and the temperature outside. In order to save the child’s life, he had therefore ordered the applicant to be threatened by detective officer E. with considerable pain which would not leave any trace of injury. He confirmed that the treatment itself was to be carried out under medical supervision. D. further admitted that he had ordered another police officer to obtain a “truth serum” to be administered to the applicant. According to the note, the threat to the applicant was exclusively aimed at saving the child’s life rather than furthering the criminal proceedings concerning the kidnapping. As the applicant had disclosed the whereabouts of J.’s body, having been threatened with pain, no measures had in fact been carried out. 21.A medical certificate issued by a police doctor on 4 October 2002 confirmed that the applicant had a haematoma (7 cm x 5 cm) below his left collarbone, skin lesions and blood scabs on his left arm and his knees and swellings on his feet. A further medical certificate dated 7 October 2002 noted that, following an examination of the applicant on 2 October 2002, two haematomas on the left-hand side of the applicant’s chest of a diameter of around 5 cm and 4 cm were confirmed, together with superficial skin lesions or blood scabs on his left arm, his knees and his right leg and closed blisters on his feet. According to the certificate, these discreet traces of injuries indicated that the injuries had been caused a few days before the examination. The precise cause of the injuries could not be diagnosed. 22.During subsequent questioning by the police on 4 October 2002, by a public prosecutor on 4, 14 and 17 October 2002, and by a district court judge on 30 January 2003 the applicant confirmed the confession he had made on 1 October 2002. 23.In January 2003 the Frankfurt am Main public prosecutor’s office opened criminal investigation proceedings against the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., and detective officer E. on the basis of the applicant’s allegations that he had been threatened on 1 October 2002.>The proceedings in the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court 24.On 9 April 2003, the first day of the hearing, the applicant, represented by counsel, lodged a preliminary application for the proceedings to be discontinued. The basis of his claim was that during interrogation and prior to confessing he had been threatened by detective officer E. with being subjected to severe pain and sexual abuse. He argued that this treatment had been in breach of Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 61 below) and Article 3 of the Convention and warranted the discontinuation of the proceedings against him. 25.The applicant also lodged an alternative preliminary application seeking a declaration that, owing to the continuous effect (Fortwirkung) of the threat of violence against him on 1 October 2002, all statements which he had made to the investigation authorities should not be relied upon in the criminal proceedings. Moreover, the applicant sought a declaration that on account of the violation of Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the use in the criminal proceedings of all items of evidence, such as the child’s corpse, which had become known to the investigation authorities because of the confession extracted – the so-called “fruit of the poisonous tree” – was prohibited (Fernwirkung). 26.On 9 April 2003, in response to the first preliminary application, the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s application for the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings. The court noted that in the applicant’s submission, detective officer E. had threatened that a specialist was on his way to the police station by helicopter who, without leaving any traces, would inflict on him intolerable pain the likes of which he had never before experienced, if he continued to refuse to disclose J.’s whereabouts. To underpin the threat, E. had imitated the sound of the rotating blades of a helicopter. E. had further threatened that the applicant would be locked up in a cell with two big “Negroes” who would anally assault him. He would wish that he had never been born. The court found as a fact that the applicant had been threatened with the infliction of considerable pain if he refused to disclose the victim’s whereabouts. However, the court did not find it established that the applicant had also been threatened with sexual abuse or had been otherwise influenced. The threat to inflict pain upon the applicant had been illegal pursuant to Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and also pursuant to Article 1 and Article 104 § 1 of the Basic Law (see paragraphs 59-60 below) and in violation of Article 3 of the Convention. 27.However, notwithstanding this breach of the applicant’s constitutional rights, the court found that the criminal proceedings were not, in consequence, barred and could proceed. It found that the use of the investigation methods in question, though prohibited in law, had not so restricted the rights of the defence that the criminal proceedings could not be pursued. In view of the seriousness of the charges against the applicant on the one hand, and the severity of the unlawful conduct during investigation on the other, there had not been such an exceptional and intolerable violation of the rule of law as to bar the continuation of the criminal proceedings. 28.In response to the applicant’s second preliminary application, the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court found that, in accordance with Article136a § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, all confessions and statements hitherto made by the applicant before the police, a public prosecutor and a district court judge were inadmissible as evidence in the criminal proceedings because they had been obtained through the use of prohibited methods of interrogation. 29.The court found that on 1 October 2002 detective officer E. had used prohibited methods of interrogation within the meaning of Article 136a § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by threatening the applicant with intolerable pain if he did not disclose the child’s whereabouts. Therefore, any statements which the applicant had made as a consequence of this forbidden investigative measure were inadmissible as evidence. This exclusion of evidence (Beweisverwertungsverbot) did not only comprise the statements made immediately after the unlawful threat. It covered all further statements which the applicant had made to the investigation authorities since that date in view of the continuous effect of the violation of Article136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 30.The procedural irregularity caused by the use of a prohibited method of investigation could only have been remedied if the applicant had been informed before his subsequent questioning that his earlier statements made as a consequence of the threat of pain could not be used as evidence against him. However, the applicant had only been instructed about his right not to testify, without having been informed about the inadmissibility of the evidence that had been improperly obtained. He had therefore not been given the necessary “qualified instruction” (qualifizierte Belehrung) before making further statements. 31.However, the court limited the inadmissible evidence to the above-mentioned statements. It went on to dismiss the applicant’s application for a declaration that, on account of the prohibited investigation methods, the use in the criminal proceedings of all items of evidence, such as the child’s corpse, which had become known to the investigation authorities as a consequence of the statements extracted from the applicant ought to be excluded from trial (Fernwirkung). The court found as follows: “... there is no long-range effect of the breach of Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure meaning that the items of evidence which have become known as a result of the statement may likewise not be used [as evidence]. The Chamber agrees in this respect with the conciliatory view (Mittelmeinung) taken by scholars and in court rulings ... according to which a balancing [of interests] in the particular circumstances of the case had to be carried out, taking into account, in particular, whether there had been a flagrant violation of the legal order, notably of provisions on fundamental rights, and according to which the seriousness of the offence investigated also had to be considered. Balancing the severity of the interference with the defendant’s fundamental rights – in the present case the threat of physical violence – and the seriousness of the offence he was charged with and which had to be investigated – the completed murder of a child – makes the exclusion of evidence which has become known as a result of the defendant’s statement – in particular the discovery of the dead child and the results of the autopsy – appear disproportionate.” 32.Following the above ruling on the applicant’s preliminary applications lodged on the opening day of the trial, the proceedings continued. The next day, in his statement on the charges, the applicant admitted having killed J., but stated that he had not initially intended to do so. His defence counsel submitted that by confessing, the applicant wanted to take responsibility for his offence notwithstanding the interrogation methods used on 1 October 2002. As the trial proceeded, all further items of evidence found as a consequence of the applicant’s original statement and which the applicant sought to have excluded were adduced. At the close of the trial on 28 July 2003 the applicant admitted that he had also intended from the outset to kill the child. He described his second confession as “the only way to accept his deep guilt” and as the “greatest possible apology for the murder of the child”. 33.On 28 July 2003 the convicted the applicant, inter alia, of murder and kidnapping with extortion causing the death of the victim. It sentenced him to life imprisonment and declared that his guilt was of particular gravity, warranting a maximum sentence (see paragraph 63 below). 34.The court found that at the hearing the applicant had been instructed anew about his right to remain silent and about the fact that none of his earlier statements could be used as evidence against him and had thereby been given the necessary qualified instruction. However, the applicant had, following the qualified instruction, confessed that he had kidnapped and killed J. His statements at the trial concerning the planning of his offence formed the essential, if not the only, basis for the court’s findings of fact. They were corroborated by the testimony of J.’s sister, the blackmail letter and the note concerning the planning of the crime found in the applicant’s flat. The findings of fact concerning the execution of the crime were exclusively based on the applicant’s confession at the trial. Further items of evidence showed that he had told the truth also in this respect. These included the findings of the autopsy as to the cause of the child’s death, the tyre tracks left by the applicant’s car near the pond where the child’s corpse had been found, and the discovery of money from the ransom which had been found in his flat or paid into his accounts. 35.In assessing the gravity of the applicant’s guilt, the court observed that he had killed his 11-year-old victim and demanded one million euros in ransom in order to preserve his self-created image of a rich and successful young lawyer. It did not share the views expressed by the public prosecutor’s office and the private accessory prosecutors that the applicant’s confession “was worth nothing” as the applicant had only confessed to what had in any event already been proven. The fact that the applicant had volunteered a full confession at the trial, even though all his earlier confessions could not be used as evidence pursuant to Article 136a § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, was a mitigating factor. However, even without his confession, the applicant would have been found guilty of kidnapping with extortion causing the death of the victim. The applicant had been kept under police surveillance after he had collected the ransom, which had later been found in his flat or paid into his accounts. Furthermore, it had been proved by the autopsy on J.’s corpse that the boy had been suffocated, and tyre tracks left by the applicant’s car had been detected at the place where J.’s body had been found. 36.The court further observed that in questioning the applicant, methods of interrogation prohibited under Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been employed. Whether and to what extent detective officer E. and the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., were guilty of an offence because of these threats had to be determined in the criminal investigations then pending against them. However, their allegedly illegal acts did not mitigate the applicant’s own guilt. The misconduct of police officers, belonging to the executive power, could not prevent the judiciary from assessing findings of fact in accordance with the law. 37.On the day following his conviction, the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Federal Court of Justice. He complained that the , in its decision of 9 April 2003, had refused his preliminary application to discontinue the criminal proceedings against him. It had further refused to declare that the use in the criminal proceedings of all other items of evidence, such as the child’s corpse, which had become known to the investigation authorities because of the statements unlawfully extracted was prohibited. The applicant included a full copy of these applications of 9 April 2003, including the grounds given for them. He further included a copy of the Regional Court’s decision of 9 April 2003 dismissing his application for the proceedings to be discontinued and argued in respect of the police’s threats of torture against him that, developing the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, such conduct “leapt beyond” the exclusion of evidence and led to an impediment to the proceedings (dass ein derartiges Verhalten das Verwertungsverbot “überspringt” und ein Verfahrenshindernis begründet). 38.In his observations dated 9 March 2004 the Federal Public Prosecutor objected that the applicant’s appeal on points of law was manifestly ill-founded. He argued that the use of prohibited methods of interrogation did not lead to an impediment to the criminal proceedings. Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure expressly provided that the use of any of the prohibited methods enumerated entailed only the exclusion of evidence. The applicant had not complained of a breach of Article 136a §3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In any event, there would be no grounds for such a complaint as the Regional Court had only used the applicant’s confession at the trial, which he had made after having been informed that his previous statements had not been admitted as evidence. 39.On 21 May 2004 the Federal Court of Justice, without giving further reasons, dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as ill-founded. 40.On 23 June 2004 the applicant lodged a complaint with the . Summarising the facts underlying the case and the content of the impugned decisions, he complained under Article 1 § 1 and Article 104 § 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law about the way in which he had been questioned by the police on the morning of 1 October 2002. He argued that he had been threatened with being subjected to torture and sexual abuse if he did not disclose the child’s whereabouts. In the circumstances of the case, this treatment amounted to torture within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention and infringed Article 104 § 1 of the Basic Law. It also violated his absolute right to human dignity under Article1 of the Basic Law, which lay at the heart of the provisions in question. These unjustifiable human rights violations ought to have been a bar to the criminal proceedings for murder and a prohibition on using the evidence obtained as a consequence of the confession extracted from him by means of prohibited measures. 41.On 14 December 2004 the Federal Constitutional Court, sitting as a panel of three judges, held that the applicant’s constitutional complaint was inadmissible. 42.Firstly, in so far as the applicant complained of the failure of the criminal courts to discontinue the proceedings against him, the court found that he had not sufficiently substantiated his complaint. It observed that the Regional Court had already stated that the police’s threat to inflict pain on the applicant had violated Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Article 3 of the Convention and that the applicant’s rights under Article1 § 1 and Article 104 § 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law had been disregarded. 43.However, the violation of fundamental rights outside the trial did not necessarily warrant the conclusion that the judgment delivered by a criminal court, which was based on the findings made during the trial, breached constitutional law. In the present case, the criminal courts had found that the methods of investigation used by the police had been prohibited, but had differed from the applicant as to the legal consequences that flowed from that finding. They had taken the view that the statements obtained as a result of the measures in question could not be used but that there was no bar to the specific criminal proceedings being pursued. 44.According to the , the procedural flaw of having used prohibited investigation measures could be regarded as having been remedied by the criminal courts, because they had prohibited the admission of the statements obtained thereby. Such a prohibition was prescribed by Article 136a § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in order to compensate for a prior infringement of the rights of the person concerned. However, the circumstances in which substantial procedural irregularities might entail a bar to criminal proceedings were not laid down in law. In these circumstances, the applicant had failed to explain why the contested methods of investigation had not only required a prohibition on using the statements obtained thereby as evidence, but should also lead to a bar to criminal proceedings against him. 45.Secondly, the Federal Constitutional Court found that, in so far as the applicant complained that the Regional Court had refused to exclude the use in the proceedings of all items of evidence obtained as a result of the confession extracted under duress, his constitutional complaint was likewise inadmissible. It held that the applicant had failed to raise this issue in the proceedings before the Federal Court of Justice. 46.The decision was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 22 December 2004. 47.On 20 December 2004 the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court delivered judgments against the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., and detective officer E. The court found that on the morning of 1 October 2002 D. had ordered that the applicant was to be questioned while being subjected to pain in the manner set out in his subsequent note for the police file (see paragraph 20 above). By doing so, he had acted against the advice of all his subordinate heads of department entrusted with the investigation into J.’s kidnapping. The heads of department had opposed this measure, which D. had previously ordered on the evening of 30 September 2002 and then twice on the morning of 1 October 2002. The heads of department had resisted the orders, proposing instead further questioning and confrontation of the applicant with J.’s family. D. had then issued an order to detective officer E. directing him to comply with his instructions that the applicant should be threatened with torture and, if necessary, subjected thereto. The subjection to pain was to be carried out under medical supervision, without any traces being left, by another specially trained police officer, who would be brought to the police station by helicopter. A police doctor had agreed to supervise the execution of D.’s order. The court noted that the measure had been aimed at finding out where the applicant had hidden J., whose life D. believed was at great risk. Therefore, E. had threatened the applicant in the manner ordered by D. and had also informed him that a “truth serum” would be administered. After approximately ten minutes, the applicant confessed that he had hidden J.’s body under a jetty at a pond near Birstein. 48.The observed that the method of investigation had not been justified. It rejected the defence of “necessity” because the method in question violated human dignity, as codified in Article 1 of the Basic Law. Respect for human dignity also lay at the heart of Article 104 § 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law and Article 3 of the Convention. The protection of human dignity was absolute, allowing of no exceptions or any balancing of interests. 49.The convicted detective officer E. of coercion committed by an official in the course of his duties. However, in terms of penalty, it cautioned the defendant and imposed a suspended fine of 60 euros (EUR) per diem for 60 days, which the defendant would be required to pay if he committed another offence during the probation period. Furthermore, the court convicted the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., of having incited E., a subordinate, to commit coercion in the course of his duties. It also cautioned D. and imposed on him a suspended fine of EUR 120 per diem for 90 days. The applicant had given evidence as a witness in these proceedings. 50.In determining the sentences, the considered that there were significant mitigating factors to be taken into account. It took into consideration that the defendants’ sole concern had been to save J.’s life and that they had been under extreme pressure because of their respective responsibilities vis-à-vis the superior authority and the public. They had been exhausted at the relevant time and had acted in a very tense and hectic situation. They did not have any previous convictions. Moreover, D. had taken responsibility for his acts by admitting and explaining them in a note for the police file on the same day. The proceedings had lasted a long time and had attracted immense media attention. The defendants had suffered prejudice in their professional career: D. had been transferred to the Hessian Ministry of the Interior, and E. had been prohibited from acting in the prosecution of criminal offences. Furthermore, it was the first time that a conflict situation such as the one in the defendants’ case had been assessed by a German criminal court. The court took into consideration as aggravating factors that D. had not acted spontaneously as he had already directed the use of force on the evening before he had given the order to E. Moreover, by their acts, the defendants had risked compromising the applicant’s conviction for murder. The court further found that the preservation of the legal order did not warrant the enforcement of the fines imposed. Through the defendants’ criminal conviction it had been made clear that an order by a State agent to use force to obtain information was illegal. 51.The judgment became final on 20 December 2004. 52.Subsequently, D. was appointed chief of the Police Headquarters for Technology, Logistics and Administration. 53.On 28 December 2005 the applicant applied to the for legal aid for bringing official liability proceedings against the for the payment of compensation. He claimed that he had been traumatised and in need of psychological treatment because of the methods deployed during the police investigation. 54.In its submissions dated 27 March 2006 the Frankfurt am Main police headquarters contested that E.’s conduct when questioning the applicant in the morning of 1 October 2002 was to be legally classified as coercion and amounted to a breach of official duties. 55.On 28 August 2006 the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s application for legal aid and the applicant appealed. 56.On 28 February 2007 the Frankfurt am Main Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. Endorsing the reasons given by the Regional Court, it confirmed, in particular, that police officers D. and E., when threatening the applicant, had infringed human dignity, which was inviolable, and had thus breached their official duties. However, the applicant would face difficulties establishing causation between the threats of torture and alleged mental damage allegedly necessitating psychological treatment. The officers’ threat was negligible compared to the traumatisation caused by the fact of having killed a child. Moreover, even assuming that the applicant would be able to prove that detective officer E. had shaken him, causing him to hit his head against a wall, or had once hit him on the chest, allegedly causing a haematoma, such physical damage would be too minor to necessitate the payment of compensation. Furthermore, the violation of his human dignity by the threat of torture did not warrant the payment of compensation since the applicant had obtained sufficient satisfaction for this by the exclusion of his statements as evidence and the criminal conviction of the police officers. 57.On 19 January 2008 the Federal Constitutional Court, allowing a constitutional complaint by the applicant, quashed the Court of Appeal’s decision and remitted the case to that court. It found that in refusing to grant the applicant legal aid, the Court of Appeal had violated the principle of equal access to court. In particular, that court had speculated that the applicant would not be able to prove that the threat to torture him had led to mental damage. In addition to that, it was not obvious that the physical injuries the applicant claimed to have suffered in the course of the interrogation, during which he had been handcuffed, could be considered to be of minor importance. Moreover, the question whether the violation of the applicant’s human dignity necessitated the payment of damages despite the satisfaction he had already obtained was a difficult legal question on which no precedent existed in a judgment of a court of final instance. It should, therefore, not be determined in an application for legal-aid proceedings. 58.The remitted proceedings are still pending before the . 59.Article 1 § 1 of the Basic Law, on the protection of human dignity, reads as follows: “Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all State authorities.” 60.Article 104 § 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law, on the rights of persons in detention, provides: “Persons taken into custody may not be subjected to mental or to physical ill-treatment.” 61.Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, on prohibited methods of interrogation (verbotene Vernehmungsmethoden), provides: “1.The freedom of the accused to make decisions and to manifest his will shall not be impaired by ill-treatment, induced fatigue, physical interference, the administration of drugs, torment, deception or hypnosis. Coercion may be used only in so far as it is permitted by the law on criminal procedure. Threatening the accused with measures that are not permitted under the law on criminal procedure or holding out the prospect of an advantage that is not contemplated by statute shall be prohibited.>Measures which impair the accused’s memory or ability to understand and accept a given situation [Einsichtsfähigkeit] shall not be permitted.>The prohibition under sub-paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply even if the accused has consented [to the proposed measure]. Statements obtained in breach of this prohibition shall not be used [in evidence], even if the accused has agreed to their use.” 62.According to Article 211 of the Criminal Code, the intentional killing of a person is to be classified as murder if certain aggravating elements are present such as cupidity, treachery or intent to cover up another offence. Murder is punishable by life imprisonment. 63.A declaration by the sentencing court that the defendant’s guilt is of a particular gravity may, inter alia, have a bearing on a subsequent decision regarding suspension of the latter part of the defendant’s prison sentence on probation. Article 57a of the Criminal Code states that the court is to suspend the remainder of a life sentence on probation if the convicted person has served fifteen years of his sentence, provided that this can be justified in the interests of public security and the particular gravity of the defendant’s guilt does not warrant the continued execution of the sentence. 64.The United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the United Nations Convention against Torture”), which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1984 (Resolution 39/46) and which came into force on 26 June 1987, provides: Article 1 “1.For the purposes of this Convention, the term ‘torture’ means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions. ...” Article 15 “Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.” Article 16 “1.Each State Party shall undertake to prevent in any territory under its jurisdiction other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture as defined in Article 1, when such acts are committed by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. In particular, the obligations contained in Articles 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall apply with the substitution for references to torture of references to other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. ...” 65.Several institutions which monitor observance of the prohibition of torture and of other inhuman or degrading treatment have addressed the question of the scope of that prohibition in the context of threats of subjecting a person to physical harm. 66.The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in its judgment of 27November 2003 (Merits, Reparations and Costs) in the case of Maritza Urrutia v. Guatemala (Series C No. 103), found: “85.With regard to the treatment that the State officials afforded to Maritza Urrutia while she was unlawfully and arbitrarily detained, the court has considered proven that the alleged victim’s head was covered by a hood, she was kept handcuffed to a bed, in a room with the light on and the radio at full volume, which prevented her from sleeping. In addition, she was subjected to very prolonged interrogations, during which she was shown photographs of individuals who showed signs of torture or had been killed in combat and she was threatened that she would be found by her family in the same way. The State agents also threatened to torture her physically or to kill her or members of her family if she did not collaborate. To this end, they showed her photographs of herself and her family and correspondence from her to her former husband ... Lastly, Maritza Urrutia was obliged to film a video, which was subsequently broadcast by two Guatemalan television channels, in which she made a statement against her will, the contents of which she was forced to ratify at a press conference held after her release ... 92.An international juridical regime of absolute prohibition of all forms of torture, both physical and psychological, has been developed and, with regard to the latter, it has been recognised that the threat or real danger of subjecting a person to physical harm produces, under determined circumstances, such a degree of moral anguish that it may be considered ‘psychological torture’. ... ... 98.In light of the foregoing, the court declares that the State violated Article 5 of the American Convention [on Human Rights], in relation to Article 1 § 1 thereof, and the obligations established in Articles 1 and 6 of the Inter-American Convention against Torture, to the detriment of Maritza Urrutia.” 67.The United Nations Special Rapporteur for the Commission on Human Rights found in his report of 3 July 2001 to the General Assembly on the question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (UN Doc. A/56/156) as follows: “As stated by the Human Rights Committee in its General Comment No. 20 (10April 1992), on Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Special Rapporteur would like to remind governments that the prohibition of torture relates not only to acts that cause physical pain but also to acts that cause mental suffering to the victim, such as intimidation and other forms of threats.” (paragraph 3) He pointed out that “the fear of physical torture may itself constitute mental torture” (paragraph 7). Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur was of the opinion that: “... serious and credible threats, including death threats, to the physical integrity of the victim or a third person can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or even to torture, especially when the victim remains in the hands of law enforcement officials.” (paragraph 8) 68.The United Nations Human Rights Committee, in its Views adopted on 29 March 1983 in the case of Estrella v. Uruguay (Communication No.74/1980), found as follows regarding the author of the communication, a concert pianist: “The author was subjected to severe physical and psychological torture, including the threat that the author’s hands would be cut off by an electric saw, in an effort to force him to admit subversive activities.” (paragraph 8.3) The Human Rights Committee held that the author had been subjected to torture in violation of Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (paragraph 10).>The admission of evidence procured as a result of torture or other prohibited ill-treatment: the exclusionary rule 69.Materials before the Court show that there is no clear consensus in the States Parties to the Convention on the scope of the exclusionary rule. 70.The United Nations Human Rights Committee stated in its General Comment No. 7 on torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 7 of the ICCPR) of 30 May 1982: “1.... it follows from Article 7, read together with Article 2 of the Covenant, that States must ensure an effective protection through some machinery of control. Complaints about ill-treatment must be investigated effectively by competent authorities. Those found guilty must be held responsible, and the alleged victims must themselves have effective remedies at their disposal, including the right to obtain compensation. Among the safeguards which may make control effective are ... provisions making confessions or other evidence obtained through torture or other treatment contrary to Article 7 inadmissible in court; ...” 71.General Comment No. 7 was replaced by General Comment No. 20 concerning prohibition of torture and cruel treatment or punishment of 10March 1992. In the latter, it is stated: “12.It is important for the discouragement of violations under Article 7 that the law must prohibit the use of admissibility in judicial proceedings of statements or confessions obtained through torture or other prohibited treatment.” 72.The United Nations Committee against Torture, which monitors the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Torture, stated in its Concluding Observations on Germany of 11 May 1998 (UN Doc. A/53/44) as follows: “The Committee recommends that further legislative attention be paid to the strict enforcement of Article 15 of the Convention and that all evidence obtained directly or indirectly by torture be strictly prevented from reaching the cognisance of the deciding judges in all judicial proceedings.” (paragraph 193) 73.The prohibition on using, in any manner prejudicial to the accused, information derived from facts learned as a result of the unlawful acts of State agents (the so-called doctrine of the “fruit of the poisonous tree”) is firmly rooted in the legal tradition of the United States of America (see, for instance, US Supreme Court, no. 82-1651, Nix v. Williams, decision of 11June 1984, 467 US 431 (1984), pp. 441 et seq.; US Supreme Court, no.82-5298, Segura v. United States, decision of 5 July 1984, 468 US 796 (1984), pp. 796-97 and 815; and US Supreme Court, no. 07-513, Herring v. United States, decision of 14 January 2009, 555 US ... (2009), part I A., with further references). The prohibition applies to information obtained from coerced confessions (see, on the issue of coercion, US Supreme Court, no. 50, Blackburn v. Alabama, decision of 11 January 1960, 361 US 199 (1960), pp. 205-07, and US Supreme Court, no. 8, Townsend v. Sain, decision of 18 March 1963, 372 US 293 (1963), pp. 293 and 307-09), meaning that if the confession leads to additional evidence, such evidence is also inadmissible in court in addition to the confession itself (compare Nix, cited above, p. 441, and Segura, cited above, p. 804). The evidence is to be excluded, however, only if the illegality is the proximate cause of the discovery of the evidence. In other words, evidence will be excluded if it can be shown that “but for” the illegal conduct it would not have been found. The exclusionary rule does not apply where the connection between the illegal police conduct and the discovery of the evidence is so remote as to dissipate the taint. This is the case, for example, where the police relied on an independent source to find the evidence (see Nix, cited above, pp.441-44, and Segura, cited above, pp. 796-97, 804-05 and 815, with further references) or where the evidence would ultimately or inevitably have been discovered even had no violation of any constitutional provision taken place (see Nix, cited above, pp. 441-44). 74.The exclusionary rule is also applied in other jurisdictions. The Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa found in its recent judgment of 10April 2008 in the case of Mthembu v. The State, case no. 379/2007, [2008] ZASCA 51 as follows: “Summary: The evidence of an accomplice extracted through torture (including real evidence derived from it) is inadmissible ... ... 33.... The Hilux and the metal box were real evidence critical to the State’s case against the appellant on the robbery counts. Ordinarily, as I have mentioned, such evidence would not be excluded because it exists independently of any constitutional violation. But these discoveries were made as [a] result of the police having tortured Ramseroop. There is no suggestion that the discoveries would have been made in any event. If they had the outcome of this case might have been different. 34.Ramseroop made his statement to the police immediately after the metal box was discovered at his home following his torture. That his subsequent testimony was given apparently voluntarily does not detract from the fact that the information contained in that statement pertaining to the Hilux and metal box was extracted through torture. ... therefore, there is an inextricable link between his torture and the nature of the evidence that was tendered in court. The torture has stained the evidence irredeemably. ... 36.To admit Ramseroop’s testimony regarding the Hilux and metal box would require us to shut our eyes to the manner in which the police obtained this information from him. More seriously, it is tantamount to involving the judicial process in ‘moral defilement’. This ‘would compromise the integrity of the judicial process (and) dishonour the administration of justice’. In the long term, the admission of torture-induced evidence can only have a corrosive effect on the criminal justice system. The public interest, in my view, demands its exclusion, irrespective of whether such evidence has an impact on the fairness of the trial. 37.For all these reasons I consider Ramseroop’s evidence relating to the Hilux and metal box to be inadmissible. ...”",2010,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

11,001-60638,Grand Chamber,"11.The applicants were born in 1960, 1950 and 1938 and live at Irigny, at Colombes and in Paris respectively. 12.The applicant was arrested on 15 April 1992 and charged by an investigating judge at Mâcon tribunal de grande instance with using a vehicle registration document that had been obtained illegally and handling a stolen vehicle. He was remanded in custody from 16 April to 18 May 1992. On 31 March 1994 he was committed to stand trial before the Mâcon Criminal Court. 13.In a judgment of 21 October 1994 the Mâcon Criminal Court dismissed the applicant's application to have the proceedings set aside as defective and, finding him guilty, imposed a suspended sentence of eight months' imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 French francs (FRF). The applicant appealed. 14.On 2 February 1995 the Dijon Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the Criminal Court in its entirety. The applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation. 15.By a judgment of 17 January 1996 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal. 16.On 5 November 1994 the applicant was caught by a speed trap while at the wheel of his vehicle. The gendarmerie reported him for exceeding the speed limit by at least 40 k.p.h., namely by driving at 143 k.p.h. in a 90k.p.h. speed-limit zone. 17.On 14 March 1995 the Melle Police Court found him guilty of the offence, and imposed a fine of FRF 1,500 and banned him from driving for twenty-one days. 18.On 15 December 1995 the Poitiers Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, and increased the fine to FRF 3,000 and the ban to three months. 19.By a judgment of 6 August 1996 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant's appeal. 20.On 11 November 1994 the police reported the applicant for two offences of failing to stop at a red traffic light. He was summoned to appear at the Paris Police Court for a hearing on 8 March 1995. 21.On 12 April 1995 the Paris Police Court found the applicant guilty of the offences. It imposed two fines of FRF 1,800 each and banned him from driving for one month. 22.On 27 October 1995 the Paris Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the Police Court in its entirety. On 2 November 1995 the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation. He sought communication of the advocate-general's written submissions in order to be able to reply to them, but to no avail. 23.By a judgment of 10 July 1996 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant's appeal. 24.The relevant provisions, as worded at the material time, read as follows: Article 567 “Judgments of indictment divisions and judgments of the criminal courts against which no ordinary appeal lies may, in the event of a breach of the law, be set aside on an appeal on points of law to the Court of Cassation lodged by the public prosecutor or by the party adversely affected, according to the distinctions made hereafter. The appeal must be lodged with the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation.” Article 584 “Appellants in the Court of Cassation may lodge a pleading bearing their signature and containing the grounds of their appeal with the registry of the court against whose judgment they are appealing either when giving notice of appeal or within the following ten days. The registrar shall issue them with a receipt.” Article 585 “After the expiry of that time-limit, convicted appellants may send their pleading directly to the Court of Cassation; the other parties may not avail themselves of this provision without being represented by a member of the Court of Cassation Bar. ...” Article 585-1 “Save where the President of the Criminal Division decides otherwise, convicted appellants shall lodge their pleading with the registry of the Court of Cassation no later than one month from the date of the notice of appeal. The same rule shall apply to notices of acting lodged by lawyers representing an appellant in the Court of Cassation.” Article 590 “The pleadings shall contain the grounds of appeal and cite the legal provisions that are alleged to have been infringed. ... They must be lodged within the prescribed time-limit. No further pleadings may be added to them once the reporting judge has filed his report. Any pleading setting out additional grounds that is lodged out of time may be declared inadmissible.” Article 602 “The reports shall be presented at the hearing. The parties' lawyers shall make their observations after the report, if appropriate. The public prosecutor shall make his or her submissions.” 25.Current practice is for the advocate-general to inform the parties' lawyers before the day of the hearing of the tenor of his or her submissions and in cases where, at the request of the lawyers, there is an oral hearing, they are entitled to reply to his or her submissions orally or by a note sent to the court in deliberations (see Reinhardt and Slimane-Kaïd v. France, judgment of 31 March 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II, p. 666, § 106). 26.In cases in which representation by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar is not compulsory, an ordinance of 15 January 1826, Article 15 of which has not been repealed, lays down that the parties may make oral representations with the permission of the Court of Cassation. On the basis of the ordinance of 1826 the Court of Cassation accepts that it is possible for it to give the parties leave to address it, or for a member of the ordinary bar to speak on their behalf. Although it is for the Court of Cassation to decide whether or not to grant permission according to the circumstances (Court of Cassation, Criminal Division, 3 May 1990, Bull. crim. [Criminal Bulletin] no. 166), it appears that its practice is to refuse such applications (see the period 1990 to 2001 and the judgments available on the Légifrance Internet site) in terms similar to the following: “Regard being had to Article 37 of the Ordinance of 15 January 1826, which has not been repealed in so far as it concerns the procedure applicable before the Criminal Division; as [the appellant] has set out his grounds of appeal against the impugned decision in a pleading which he has lodged in person, his appearance in person before the Criminal Division does not appear to be either necessary or appropriate; it is not necessary to order it.” (judgment of 15 December 1999, appeal on points of law no. 99-80015) 27.As regards more particularly cases involving road-traffic offences (such as parking or speeding offences), there have been numerous decisions in which applications made by members of the ordinary bar have been turned down, the Court of Cassation holding as in the following decision: “[The appellant] has requested permission to appear before the Court of Cassation assisted by Mr [...], a member of the Paris Bar [...]. As [the appellant] has set out his grounds of appeal against the impugned decision in a pleading which he has lodged in person, his appearance in person before the Criminal Division does not appear to be essential.” (judgment of 16 May 2001, appeal on points of lawno.0086011) 28.Indeed, the Government acknowledge that such permission is rarely granted, the principle being that the members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar have a monopoly on making oral representations. They must consult the President of the Criminal Division beforehand regarding the ground of appeal on points of law for which they consider oral representations to be necessary. In 2001 oral representations were only made in some 40 or so appeals out of a total of 9,637 that were heard. 29.The members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar are the successors to the King's Bench attorneys, who practised during the Ancien Régime. Rights of audience before the King's Bench were reserved to attorneys who were royal officers and owned their official appointment (charge) from 1643 onwards. By the time of the Revolution in 1789 there were seventy-three attorneys at the King's Bench. The Revolution brought their activities to an end. They became counsel at the Tribunal of Cassation that was created in 1790, and subsequently, in 1804, members of the Court of Cassation Bar. Another group of lawyers practised at the Conseil d'Etat. The two groups were merged by an ordinance of 10 September 1817. That ordinance, which for many years served as the Bar Council Charter, was amended by a decree of 28 October 1991 (which codified the conditions of access to the profession and has since undergone a number of subsequent amendments; see also the law of 20 March 1948, which made women eligible to enter the profession, and the decree of 15 March 1978, allowing lawyers to practise in professional partnerships). The existence of a specialised bar is peculiar to France and Belgium (where only members of the Court of Cassation Bar belong to a separate bar council). 30.Members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, unlike members of the ordinary bar, are ministerial officers. The number of official appointees has been irrevocably set at sixty since 1817. The conditions of access require in principle the candidate to be a practising lawyer, to have undergone special training and to have passed a professional entrance examination organised by the Bar Council (the legislation nevertheless provides for a number of exemptions and special means of access). Appointments are made by order of the Minister of Justice, on the basis of a reasoned opinion issued by the Bar Council, the Vice-President of the Conseil d'Etat and the President of the Court of Cassation. 31.In proceedings before the Court of Cassation, representation by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar is in principle compulsory, particularly in civil proceedings, unless an exemption is obtained. Members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar cannot represent the parties before the lower courts (although they may give advice and appear before the administrative courts of appeal and administrative courts). In proceedings before the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation they are required to consult with the President of the Criminal Division before the hearing if they wish to make oral representations, in order to explain the points of law they wish to make orally and to determine by agreement the arrangements under which they will be allowed to do so. 32.Directive 98/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 to facilitate practice of the profession of lawyer on a permanent basis in a member State other than that in which the qualification was obtained provides, inter alia, at Article 5 § 3, sub-paragraph 2: “... in order to ensure the smooth operation of the justice system, member States may lay down specific rules for access to supreme courts, such as the use of specialist lawyers” (see also Court of Justice of the European Communities, 7 November 2000, Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, Case no.168/98).",2002,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT
1.  HOLDS BY SIXTEEN VOTES TO ONE THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 §§ 1 OR 3 (C) OF THE CONVENTION AS REGARDS THE FACT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE APPLICANTS TO MAKE ORAL REPRESENTATIONS TO THE COURT OF CASSATION AT THE HEARING;

153,001-94072,Grand Chamber,"7.The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in .>The applicant was placed in detention on 23 December 1993.>Several sets of criminal proceedings were brought against him, as a result of which he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment for, among other offences, membership of a mafia-type criminal organisation, drug trafficking and illegal possession of firearms. On 27 December 2001 the public prosecutor at the Milan Court of Appeal ordered that the applicant’s sentences be aggregated and fixed the overall term at thirty years. 10.The applicant was detained in several Italian prisons (including Palermo, Catania, Pisa and ). 11.On 10 August 1994, in view of the danger posed by the applicant, the Minister of Justice issued a decree ordering that he be subject for one year to the special prison regime provided for in the second paragraph of section 41 bis of the Prison Administration Act (“Law no. 354 of 1975”). This provision, which was amended by Law no. 279 of 23 December 2002 (“Law no. 279 of 2002”), allows application of the ordinary prison regime to be suspended in whole or in part for reasons of public order and safety. The 1994 decree imposed the following restrictions: –restrictions on visits by family members (a maximum of a single onehour visit per month); –no meetings with non-family members; –prohibition on using the telephone; –no sums of money above a fixed amount to be received or sent out; –no more than two parcels to be received per month, but permission to receive two parcels per year containing clothing and linen; –ban on organising cultural, recreational or sports activities; –no right to vote in elections for prisoners’ representatives or to be elected as a representative; –no handicraft activities; –no food requiring cooking to be purchased; –no more than two hours’ outdoor exercise per day. 12.In addition, all the applicant’s correspondence was to be monitored, subject to prior authorisation by the judicial authority. 13.The application of the special regime was subsequently extended on nineteen occasions for successive periods of one year or six months. Each decree covered a limited period, as follows: 10 August 1994 – 9 August 1995 (decree no. 1) 5 August 1995 – 5 February 1996 (decree no. 2) 2 February 1996 – 2 August 1996 (decree no. 3) 31 July 1996 – 31 January 1997 (decree no. 4) 4 February 1997 – 4 August 1997 (decree no. 5) 31 July 1997 – 31 January 1998 (decree no. 6) 4 February 1998 – 4 August 1998 (decree no. 7) 30 July 1998 – 30 January 1999 (decree no. 8) 27 January 1999 – 27 July 1999 (decree no. 9) 22 July 1999 – 31 December 1999 (decree no. 10) 23 December 1999 – 23 June 2000 (decree no. 11) 22 June 2000 – 31 December 2000 (decree no. 12) 21 December 2000 – 21 June 2001 (decree no. 13) 18 June 2001 – 18 December 2001 (decree no. 14) 13 December 2001 – 13 June 2002 (decree no. 15) 10 June 2002 – 31 December 2002 (decree no. 16) 28 December 2002 – 22 December 2003 (decree no. 17) 23 December 2003 – 23 December 2004 (decree no. 18) 17 December 2004 – 17 December 2005 (decree no. 19). 14.The applicant appealed against most of these decrees to the court responsible for the execution of sentences. The case file shows that the applicant did not appeal on points of law against the decisions of the latter court. He maintained that the Court of Cassation would in any event have dismissed the appeals on the ground that he no longer had an interest in having them examined since the period of validity of the decrees in question had expired. –Decree no. 1 On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against the decree of 10August 1994. In a decision of 28 February 1995, the court responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the appeal, taking the view that the application of the special prison regime was justified. However, the restrictions were eased to allow the applicant one hour-long telephone conversation per month with members of his family, in the absence of a visit by the latter; the restriction on the time spent in outdoor exercise and the prohibition on purchasing food requiring cooking were also lifted. –Decree no. 3 On 9 February 1996 the applicant appealed against the decree of 2February 1996. In a decision of 26 March 1996, deposited with its registry on 30 March 1996 and served on the applicant on 30 April 1996, the court responsible for the execution of sentences declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that, in accordance with the restrictive case-law followed at the time, the court hearing the case did not have the power to examine the merits of the restrictions imposed. –Decree no. 5 On 6 February 1997 the applicant appealed against the decree of 4February 1997 (served the following day). In a decision of 6 May 1997, deposited with the registry on 15 May 1997 and served on the applicant on 21May 1997, the court, while upholding the application of the special regime, relaxed the restriction on visits by family members in order to allow the applicant two hour-long visits per month. –Decree no. 6 On 4 August 1997 the applicant appealed against the decree of 31 July 1997 (served on 2 August 1997). In a decision of 16 October 1997, deposited with the registry on 22 October 1997 and served on the applicant on 24 October 1997, the court responsible for the execution of sentences, while upholding the application of the special regime, lifted the restriction on the number of visits by family members. –Decree no. 7 On 9 February 1998 the applicant appealed against the decree of 4February 1998. In a decision of 2 July 1998, deposited with the registry on 9July 1998 and served on the applicant on 12 August 1998, the court responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the appeal on the ground that the restrictions imposed on the applicant were justified. –Decree no. 8 On 3 August 1998 the applicant appealed against the decree of 30 July 1998 (served the following day). In a decision of 30 November 1998, deposited with the registry on 9 December 1998 and served on the applicant on 23 December 1998, the court responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the appeal on the ground that the restrictions imposed on the applicant were justified. –Decree no. 9 On 1 February 1999 the applicant appealed against the decree of 27January 1999. In a decision of 7 October 1999, deposited with the registry on 20 October 1999 and served on the applicant on an unspecified date, the court responsible for the execution of sentences declared the appeal inadmissible. It observed that the period of validity of the decree had expired on 27 July 1999 and that, accordingly, the applicant no longer had an interest in having it examined. –Decree no. 10 On 27 July 1999 the applicant appealed against the decree of 22 July 1999 (served on 24 July 1999). The Court has not been informed of the outcome of this appeal. –Decree no. 11 On 28 December 1999 the applicant appealed against the decree of 23December 1999. In a decision of 11 May 2000, deposited with the registry on 23 May 2000 and served on the applicant on 21 July 2000, the court responsible for the execution of sentences declared the appeal inadmissible as the applicant had declared his intention not to pursue it. –Decree no. 12 On 26 June 2000 the applicant appealed against the decree of 22 June 2000 (served on 23 June 2000). In a decision of 6 November 2001, the court responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the appeal on the ground that the validity of the impugned decree had expired. –Decree no. 13 On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against the decree of 21December 2000. In a decision of 23 April 2001, deposited with the registry on 3 May 2001, the court responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the appeal as unsubstantiated. –Decree no. 14 On 21 June 2001 the applicant appealed against the decree of 18 June 2001 (served on 20 June 2001). In a decision of 14 November 2001, the court responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the appeal on the ground that application of the special prison regime was justified in view of the danger posed by the applicant and his links with criminal circles. –Decree no. 15 On 17 December 2001 the applicant appealed against the decree of 13December 2001 (served on 14 December 2001). In a decision of 11 April 2002, the court responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the appeal as unsubstantiated. –Decree no. 17 On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against the decree of 28December 2002. He requested the court responsible for the execution of sentences to seek a review by the Constitutional Court of the compatibility of paragraph 2 bis of section 41 bis (as amended by Law no. 279 of 2002) with several Articles of the Constitution. In a decision of 3 March 2003, served on the applicant on 8 April 2003, the court responsible for the execution of sentences ordered that the file be transmitted to the Constitutional Court. The decision was taken on the ground that, in so far as Law no. 279 of 2002 did not require the Minister of Justice to give reasons for the decrees, an issue of constitutionality could arise. The court observed in particular that in the instant case the applicant had been subject to the special prison regime since 1994 and that the reasons given for the decrees extending application of the regime related to ongoing links between the applicant and the criminal organisation to which he belonged, notwithstanding the fact that he was subject to the special regime. By decision no. 417 of 13 December 2004, deposited with the registry on 23December 2004, the dismissed the objection as to constitutionality raised by the court responsible for the execution of sentences, finding that it was manifestly ill-founded. –Decree no. 18 On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against the decree of 23December 2003. He argued that the special regime was hindering his rehabilitation, in breach of Article 27 of the Constitution, and that it failed to respect the needs of his personality, contrary to section 13 of Law no. 354 of 1975. In a decision of 19 November 2004, deposited with the registry on 15December 2004, the court responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the appeal on the basis of the police investigations, on the ground that application of the special regime was justified on account of the applicant’s links to organised crime. –Decree no. 19 On 23 December 2004 the applicant appealed against the decree of 17December 2004. In a decision of 11 February 2005, deposited with the registry on 28 February 2005, the court responsible for the execution of sentences allowed the applicant’s appeal. It took the view that the security considerations which had been the reason for applying the special prison regime were no longer valid; it therefore ordered the measure in question to be rescinded. 15.On 1 March 2005 the prison authorities placed the applicant in a high-supervision (“E.V.”) unit. 16.On 24 April 2008 the judge responsible for the execution of sentences, on a provisional basis and pending the decision of the court responsible for the execution of sentences, ordered a stay of execution of the applicant’s sentence and his release in order to undergo urgent surgery. This decision was upheld on 2 October 2008 by the court responsible for the execution of sentences. 17.The applicant suffers from a number of disorders which oblige him to use a wheelchair. From June 2000 to February 2005 he served his sentence in the part of the hospital wing of Naples Prison (Secondigliano) reserved for prisoners detained under the section 41 bis regime. 18.On an unspecified date the applicant applied to the court responsible for the execution of sentences for a stay of execution of his sentence on health grounds, under Articles 146 and 147 of the Criminal Code. In a decision of 18 January 2001, the court responsible for the execution of sentences, basing its decision on a report drawn up by the prison medical team, rejected the application on the ground that the applicant was being held in the prison’s hospital wing and was receiving treatment appropriate to his state of health. 19.On an unspecified date the applicant made a fresh application to the judge responsible for the execution of sentences for a stay of execution of his sentence on health grounds. In a decision of 22 March 2002, the judge rejected the application on the ground that the applicant’s state of health was not incompatible with detention in the prison hospital wing. On 2 July 2002 the court responsible for the execution of sentences upheld that decision. 20.In February 2007, after authorisation had been obtained from the court responsible for the execution of sentences, the applicant was taken to a civil hospital for an operation to remove a kidney. 21.On 24 April 2008 the judge responsible for the execution of sentences provisionally stayed execution of the applicant’s sentence and ordered his release in order to undergo urgent surgery (see paragraph 16 above). 22.According to the information provided to the Court by the parties, the Naples court responsible for the execution of sentences ordered a stay of execution of the applicant’s sentence on 2 October 2008 on account of his state of health. The applicant had had an operation to remove one of two brain tumours on 3 September 2008 and his state of health was found to be incompatible with detention. The court placed him under house arrest for a period of six months, prohibiting contact with any persons other than family members and medical personnel. The court’s decision to place the applicant under house arrest was based on the applicant’s criminal personality and the length of his sentence and on a note from the police authorities dated 16 April 2008. 23.The Court has not been informed of the applicant’s current state of health. 24.On 10 August 1994 the Minister of Justice issued the first decree subjecting the applicant to the special prison regime and ordered the monitoring of all his correspondence, subject to prior authorisation by the judicial authority (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). 25.The corresponding decisions of the court responsible for the execution of sentences communicated to the Court relate to the period between 2 July 1996 and 7 July 2004. The first decisions imposed the measure in relation to all correspondence for an unspecified period. On 3August 1999 the judge responsible for the execution of sentences fixed the maximum period at six months and ordered that the applicant’s correspondence with the European Court of Human Rights, in particular, should not be monitored. 26.The applicant furnished a copy of an undated letter and an envelope, both addressed to his lawyer, Mr Vetrano, the latter postmarked 3 March 2000. Both documents had been inspected by the prison authorities, but the corresponding stamps were not dated. 27.On 16 October 1999 the applicant applied to the Milan District Court for prison leave in order to attend his brother’s funeral. On 18 October 1999 the court allowed the application but made the leave subject to whatever detailed arrangements might be laid down by the courts responsible for the execution of sentences. It also ordered that “the other judicial authorities concerned, the public prosecutor’s office and the applicant” be informed of its decision. 28.The case file shows that the Milan Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s application on 19 October 1999 on account of the risk that he might abscond. The decision was deposited with the registry on 21 October 1999. 29.The applicant stated that he had also applied for prison leave to attend his partner’s funeral. 30.The relevant domestic law and practice summarised in the Ospina Vargas v. Italy judgment (no. 40750/98, §§ 23-33, 14 October 2004) are set out below. 31.Section 41 bis of the Prison Administration Act (Law no. 354 of 1975), as amended by Law no. 356 of 7 August 1992, gives the Minister of Justice the power to suspend application of the ordinary prison regime as laid down in Law no. 354 of 1975 in whole or in part, by means of a decision stating grounds which is subject to judicial review, for reasons of public order and security in cases where the ordinary prison regime would conflict with these requirements. Such a measure can be applied only to prisoners charged with or sentenced for the offences mentioned in section 4 bis of the Act, which include offences relating to Mafia activities. Pursuant to Law no. 36 of 1995, and subsequently Law no. 11 of 1998 and Law no. 446 of 1999, application of the section 41 bis special regime was extended until 31 December 2000. It was later extended until 31December 2002 pursuant to Law no. 4 of 19 January 2001. On the entry into force on 23 December 2002 of Law no. 279, partly amending the Prison Administration Act, the special prison regime ceased to be temporary in nature. On the basis of Legislative Decree no. 773/2009, the special regime is now applied for an initial period of four years (compared with one year previously); this can subsequently be extended by two years (compared with one year previously). 32.Before Law no. 279 of 2002 came into force, the choice of measures resulting from the application of section 41 bis was left to the discretion of the Minister of Justice. However, the measures imposed were generally the following: –a ban on participating in the preparation of food and organising prisoners’ recreational activities; –a ban on visits by persons other than family members, a cohabitant or a lawyer; –a maximum of two visits by family members and one telephone call per month; –monitoring of all the prisoner’s correspondence except for that with his lawyer; –not more than two hours per day to be spent outdoors; –restrictions on acquiring or receiving from outside prison personal possessions authorised by the prison’s internal rules; –no more than two parcels per month; –no sums of money to be received from outside prison or sent out; –no handicrafts involving the use of dangerous tools. 33.Section 14 ter of the Prison Administration Act provides for the possibility of an appeal (reclamo) to the court responsible for the execution of sentences against a decree imposing the special prison regime within tendays from the date on which the person concerned receives a copy of the decree. Such an appeal does not have suspensive effect. The court must give a ruling within ten days. An appeal to the Court of Cassation lies against the decision of the court responsible for the execution of sentences; again, such an appeal must be lodged within ten days of the date on which the refusal by the court has been served. Until Law no. 279 of 2002 came into force, section 14 ter also applied to complaints about decrees adopted by the Minister of Justice under section41 bis. Paragraphs 2 quinquies and 2 sexies of section 41 bis have subsequently provided for a special complaints procedure, which is nonetheless modelled on the procedure laid down in section 14 ter. 34.The was asked to rule on whether such a system complied with the principle of non-encroachment on matters reserved for the legislature. In judgments nos. 349 and 410 of 1993, it held that section41 bis was compatible with the Constitution. It observed that while the special prison regime within the meaning of the provision in question was in practice laid down by the Minister, an appeal lay against a ministerial decree to the courts responsible for the execution of sentences, which had the power to review both the need for such a measure and the actual measures to be applied to the prisoner concerned, which in any event ought never to entail inhuman treatment. However, on the basis of Article 15 of the Constitution, which provides, inter alia, that restrictions on correspondence may be imposed only by means of a court decision containing a statement of reasons, the held that the power to order monitoring of a prisoner’s correspondence was vested in the courts alone. As a result, section 41 bis could not be construed as empowering the Minister of Justice to take measures relating to prisoners’ correspondence. Accordingly, from the end of 1993 the sole basis for monitoring of correspondence was section 18 of Law no. 354 of 1975, as amended by section 1 of Law no. 1 of 1977. Under that provision, the court before which proceedings are pending (until the delivery of the first-instance judgment) or the court responsible for the execution of sentences (during any subsequent proceedings) may order the monitoring of prisoners’ correspondence, stating reasons for its decision; the provision does not, however, specify the cases in which such a decision may be taken. In practice, monitoring means interception of all a prisoner’s correspondence, which is then read by the judicial authority which ordered it, by the governor of the prison or by prison staff designated by the governor. The letters are then stamped to show that they have been inspected. The deletion of words or sentences is not permitted, but the judicial authority may order that one or more letters should not be delivered, in which case the prisoner must be informed immediately. Such an order may also be made provisionally by the prison governor, who must inform the judicial authority. Section 18 of Law no. 354 of 1975 also provides that prisoners are allowed to keep books and magazines and to use other means of communication. This right may be restricted in a decision by the judicial authority, in accordance with the same conditions that apply in the case of correspondence. Under section 35 of the same Law, prisoners may make sealed applications or complaints concerning decisions taken in accordance with section 18 of Law no. 354 of 1975 to, inter alia, the prison authorities and the court responsible for the execution of sentences. 35.In judgment no. 351 of 14 of 18 October 1996, the Constitutional Court held that the power of judicial review by the courts responsible for the execution of sentences extended to the practical arrangements for implementing a measure, regard being had both to the aim pursued and to the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. 36.On 7 February 1997, applying the principles laid down by the in judgment no. 351/1996, the Prison Administration Department of the Ministry of Justice sent a circular to prison governors regarding organisation of the wings where prisoners subject to the special regime were held. The circular contained the following instructions, among others: prisoners would from then on be allowed to use stoves; they would have access to rooms equipped for sporting activities and to a library; visits by family members could be replaced by telephone calls; and the use of glass partitions would continue but, as a result, the searching of visitors need not be so strict. 37.In judgment no. 376 of 26 November to 5 December 1997, the Constitutional Court reaffirmed that section 41 bis was compatible with the Constitution, while amending and clarifying the manner in which it was to be interpreted. It considered, in particular, that decrees imposing the special regime had to be based on genuine public-order and security grounds, and that decisions to extend application of the regime also had to be based on sufficient grounds independent of those which had justified its initial imposition. The emphasised that the special regime should not entail inhuman treatment or hinder the prisoner’s rehabilitation, which would be contrary to Article 27 of the Constitution. It nevertheless stated that at no time did section 13 of the Prison Administration Act cease to apply, under which the treatment to which a prisoner was subjected had to respect his personality, and a rehabilitation programme had to be prepared and adapted on the basis of scientific observation of the prisoner’s personality and with his or her cooperation. 38.On 20 February 1998, in accordance with the principles laid down by the in judgment no. 376/1997, the Prison Administration Department of the Ministry of Justice sent a circular to prison governors regarding organisation of the wings where prisoners subject to the special regime were held. The circular contained the following instructions, among others: –outdoor exercise time was to be increased to four hours per day, but care was to be taken to ensure that this did not become an opportunity for meeting or making contact with other presumed members of the Mafia; –the outdoor exercise yards in Naples and Pisa Prisons were to be equipped for physical exercise and sport; –one or more rooms for social, cultural or recreational activities were to be provided in each wing to which prisoners subject to the special regime were permanently assigned or which were occupied by them for medical reasons; –on the question of work, the circular stated that where it was not possible to equip a prison appropriately prisoners should have access to premises equipped for this purpose in other prisons, with measures in place to exclude any opportunity of meeting or making contact with other presumed members of the Mafia; –visits by children under 16 years of age could take place without a glass partition; if the visit took place in the presence of other persons, partition-free access was to be authorised for the children only and was not to exceed one-sixth of the total duration of the visit in length; –prisoners subject to the special regime could receive parcels containing foodstuffs apart from those requiring cooking, because they were not allowed to use stoves except for the purpose of making hot drinks or heating up pre-cooked food. 39.With regard to the monitoring of correspondence, in judgment no. 26 of 8 to 11 February 1999, the Constitutional Court, ruling in a case concerning the refusal of the prison authorities to allow a prisoner to receive an erotic publication, declared unconstitutional sections 35 (on the remedies available to prisoners) and 69 (on the functions and decisions of the judge responsible for the execution of sentences) of Law no. 354 of 1975 in that they did not provide for any form of judicial review of decisions likely to interfere with prisoners’ rights, in particular decisions to monitor correspondence or to restrict the right to receive magazines or other periodicals. Decisions by the authorities to which applications were made under section 35 were adopted without adversarial proceedings and no appeal to the ordinary courts or the Court of Cassation lay against them. The lack of such a remedy had, moreover, already been noted and criticised by the European Court in the Calogero Diana v. Italy and Domenichini v. Italy judgments (15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V). 40.Following the entry into force of Law no. 95 of 8 April 2004, a new section 18 ter concerning the monitoring of correspondence has been added to the Prison Administration Act. It provides that correspondence may be monitored for a maximum period of six months in order to prevent the commission of crimes or to maintain security in prisons and to ensure the confidentiality of investigations. Monitoring is ordered in a decision with a statement of grounds by the judicial authority, at the request of the prosecuting authorities or the prison governor. Paragraph 2 of section 18 ter provides that prisoners’ correspondence with, inter alia, their lawyers and international human rights bodies cannot be monitored. Lastly, paragraph 6 of section 18 ter provides that complaints against decisions to monitor correspondence may be lodged in accordance with the procedure laid down in section 14 bis of the Prison Administration Act. 41.As is stated in the official report by the Ministry of Justice submitted to the Court by the Government in May 2004, the following measures may result from the application of section 41 bis as amended by Law no. 279 of 2002, with a view to preventing contact with the criminal organisation in question or other prisoners belonging to it: (a)outdoor exercise time limited to four hours per day in groups of no more than five prisoners (members of each group must be subject to the same type of regime and the groups must be rotated every three months); (b)stoves made available to prisoners when the cells are opened and taken back for storage elsewhere when the cells are closed; (c)ban on the use of FM radios, tape recorders and CD players; (d)a minimum of one visit per month and a maximum of two per month, in rooms equipped in such a way that no objects may be handed over; a ban on visits by persons other than family members, a cohabitant or a lawyer, unless exceptional permission has been granted; after the regime has been in force for six months, one telephone call per month, lasting no more than ten minutes, to family members, who are required to go to the prison nearest their place of residence; (e)interviews with lawyers, which are unlimited, are subject only to visual surveillance by a warder; telephone calls are subject to the same conditions regarding frequency and practical arrangements as calls to family members; (f)monitoring of all the prisoner’s correspondence except for that with members of parliament or the appropriate European and national judicial authorities (the contents of the envelope are checked in the prisoner’s presence but the correspondence itself is not read); (g)restrictions on acquiring or receiving from outside prison sums of money and other possessions and items (two parcels per month, weighing a maximum of 10 kg, plus two parcels a year containing only clothing and linen); (h)ban on being elected as a prisoners’ representative; (i)access by ministers of faiths other than catholicism may be permitted. 42.Having regard to the reform introduced by Law no. 279 of 2002 and to the decisions of the Court (see, most recently, the judgment in Ganci v. Italy, no. 41576/98, §§ 19-31, ECHR 2003XI), the Court of Cassation, in a departure from its previous case-law, held that prisoners had an interest in obtaining a decision even if the period of validity of the impugned decree had expired, as the decision had a direct impact on decrees subsequent to the one in question (Court of Cassation, First Division, judgment of 26 January 2004, deposited with the registry on 5 February 2004, no. 4599, Zara). 43.Under the terms of sections 13 and 14 of Law no. 354 of 1975, the treatment of each prisoner must be adapted to the particular demands of his or her personality. The number of inmates in each prison and in each wing of the prison must be limited in order to facilitate individually tailored treatment. The assignment of prisoners to a particular prison or their grouping within a prison wing must be decided with reference to the possibility of rehabilitation and the need to prevent prisoners from exerting a negative influence on one another. 44.On the basis of the principle of individually tailored treatment of prisoners laid down in the above provisions and of the regulation implementing Law no. 354 of 1975, circular no. 3479/5929 of 9 July 1998 issued by the Prison Administration Department provided for three levels of detention corresponding to certain categories of prisoner. 45.“High-security units” are designed for prisoners accused or convicted of membership of a mafia-type criminal organisation, false imprisonment with a view to extortion, or drug trafficking. In view of the danger posed by these persons and the risk of their seeking to recruit or intimidate others, particularly stringent measures are put in place aimed at separating them from other prisoners and keeping them under supervision. In addition, activities for these prisoners such as outdoor exercise, visits, vocational training and sport take place within a predefined area. 46.“Medium-security units” are for prisoners accused or convicted of offences committed with a view to facilitating the activities of mafia-type criminal organisations, and who therefore present a substantial degree of danger. 47.“E.V. units” are for prisoners who present a degree of danger such that their detention in a medium-security unit would be inadequate to ensure public order and safety. The danger posed by these prisoners stems in particular from their involvement in terrorist crime, the nature or number of the crimes committed, their attempts at escape or serious acts of violence perpetrated by them against other prisoners or prison officers. Under the terms of circular no. 3479/5929, in the absence of any specific provisions governing the matter, E.V. units are run along the same lines as the highsecurity units. Contact with prisoners in other units is prohibited and supervision is particularly tight. 48.The Recommendation reads as follows: “The Committee of Ministers, under the terms of Article 15.b of the Statute of the Council of Europe, Having regard to the European Convention on Human Rights and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights; ... Stressing that the enforcement of custodial sentences and the treatment of prisoners necessitate taking account of the requirements of safety, security and discipline while also ensuring prison conditions which do not infringe human dignity and which offer meaningful occupational activities and treatment programmes to inmates, thus preparing them for their reintegration into society; ...

161,001-58907,Grand Chamber,"8.The applicant has the degree of Bachelor of Laws and is registered as a member of the Madrid Bar, but in fact works as a nurse. He submitted that in August 1985 one M. gave him instructions to carry out certain non-contentious (extraprocesal) work, including in particular a search to discover any encumbrances affecting the title to a piece of land which was among the property made subject to a charging order in summary foreclosure proceedings under the Mortgage Act (juicio sumario ejecutivo de la Ley Hipotecaria) brought by the X company against S. before judgeno. 19 of the Madrid Court of First Instance. On 19 June 1986 M. bought the land at auction, at a price which the applicant considered advantageous.>The applicant maintained that in 1986 he unsuccessfully asked his client to pay him for the administrative services, advice and technical assistance he had provided at the time of the purchase in question. He asserted that, by a registered letter of 27 May 1989 with a prepaid form for acknowledgment of receipt, to which he received no reply, he asked M. to pay him the sum of two million five hundred thousand pesetas to cover his fees. 10.On 8 June 1989, at the applicant’s request, the Madrid Bar gave an opinion assessing the fees the applicant was entitled to claim for the services in question at three million pesetas. The Bar made it clear that its assessment was based exclusively on the information provided by the applicant. 11.On 16 June 1989 the applicant brought proceedings against M. under the taxation procedure (procedimiento de jura de cuenta) before judge no. 2 of the Madrid Court of First Instance to recover the sum he claimed. Judgment was given against the applicant on 30 June 1989 on the ground that the jura de cuenta procedure was intended only for the recovery of fees owed for services rendered by counsel in the context of judicial proceedings and that the services he had rendered had been non-contentious. 12.On 29 September 1989 the applicant brought an ordinary civil action (juicio declarativo ordinario) against M. before judge no. 12 of the Madrid Court of First Instance seeking payment of three million pesetas. 13.This claim was dismissed by a judgment of 24 May 1993. The judge took into account the statements of the defendant, who had denied the facts alleged by the applicant, and in particular that he had ever given Mr García Ruiz instructions to act for him, held that the evidence of a witness called by the applicant was not conclusive and ruled that the applicant had not proved that he had performed the services in question. He held in particular: “The plaintiff asserts that he was instructed by the defendant (M.) to perform a number of services for him consisting in checking which court was dealing with certain proceedings and providing other information M. considered necessary to inform his decision as to whether to buy a certain property. In support of his claim he has submitted, in addition to his pleading, a series of documents, numbered 1 to 7 in the file. In his deposition (confesión judicial) the defendant contested the truth of the facts on which the claim is based, denying that there had ever been any kind of contractual relationship between himself and the plaintiff or that he had asked the latter to perform the professional services which he claimed to have carried out according to the defendant’s instructions. ... Be that as it may, the plaintiff admits that he did not perform the services concerned in the context of judicial proceedings... What is not in doubt is that he must prove that he actually did perform the services in issue. In that connection, no evidence has been produced in the case which might establish the truth of the allegations... Consideration of the evidence adduced suffices in itself to persuade the Court that the plaintiff has not satisfied a single one of the conditions for claiming lawyer’s fees. In the absence of evidence, the claim must be rejected, especially as the defendant denies the facts.” 14.On 4 June 1993 the applicant appealed. By a judgment of 17 March 1995, the Madrid Audiencia Provincial dismissed the appeal and upheld the impugned judgment. In Part I of its judgment (The Facts) it stated: “[This Court] accepts and deems to be reproduced in its own decision the statement of the facts set out in the impugned judgment.” In Part II (The Law) it ruled: “The grounds of the impugned decision are accepted as pertinent, in so far as they are not incompatible with those set out below. Firstly, the appeal is against the decision given by judge no. 12 of the Madrid Court of First Instance on 24 May 1993, dismissing the claim of the appellant [that is the applicant], a lawyer, against M., for three million pesetas in respect of fees owed on account of work he had done as counsel in summary foreclosure proceedings no.843/81, brought in the Court of First Instance. M. contests the appeal on the ground that the appellant never acted in the proceedings in question, as his legal representative in that case was Mr J.A. C.L. Secondly, the case file does not contain the slightest evidence that the appellant [the applicant] acted as counsel in case no. 843/81, or at least that, as Article 1214 of the Civil Code requires, he took steps of a procedural nature, although he may have carried out non-contentious work; the appeal must accordingly be dismissed and the impugned judgment upheld ...” The Audiencia Provincial concluded: “... This Court must dismiss, and hereby dismisses, the appeal lodged by [the applicant’s lawyer] against the judgment given by judge no. 12 of the Madrid Court of First Instance on 24 May 1993, which is hereby upheld...” 15.On 13 May 1995 the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court relying on the right to a fair hearing, contending that the judgment of the Audiencia Provincial had given no reply whatsoever to his arguments. In his appeal the applicant made the following points: “(a)Indeed, [the applicant] did not act as counsel in summary foreclosure proceedings no. 843/81 before judge no. 19 of the Madrid Court of First Instance, as the impugned decision states; he acted solely as the agent of the respondent [M.], providing non-contentious services in the form of advice and assistance (as stated in the initial application) and in the proceedings brought before judge no. 19; but he never carried out any contentious work (ejercicio intraprocesal) in those proceedings ... ... (c)... the non-contentious work ... formed the only basis for the judicial proceedings to recover fees for services rendered ...; ... the client unjustly obtained a financial gain ... on account of the performance of the various non-contentious services which he had requested and which were in fact performed ...” The applicant also stated his disagreement with the way the judge of the Court of First Instance had assessed and interpreted his evidence. 16.By a decision of 11 July 1995 the Constitutional Court dismissed the appeal on the ground that it had no constitutional relevance, observing that the ordinary courts had held that the applicant had not adduced sufficient evidence that he had rendered the professional services in issue and that assessment of the facts was a matter over which the trial courts had sole jurisdiction, to the exclusion of its own jurisdiction. 17.Article 120 § 3 of the Spanish Constitution is worded as follows: “Judgments shall always contain a statement of the grounds on which they are based and be delivered in public.” “Las sentencias serán siempre motivadas y se pronunciarán en audiencia pública.” 18.Article 359 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: “Judgments must be clear and precise and must address specifically the applications and other claims made in the course of the proceedings; they must find for or against the defendant and rule on all the disputed points which have been the subject of argument ...” “Las sentencias deben ser claras, precisas y congruentes con las demandas y con las demás pretensiones deducidas oportunamente en el pleito, haciendo las declaraciones que éstas exijan, condenando o absolviendo al demandado y decidiendo todos los puntos litigiosos que hayan sido objeto del debate ...”",1999,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

104,001-59158,Grand Chamber,"10.The applicant is a gypsy by birth. Since her birth she has travelled constantly, mainly in the Surrey area, with her family in search of work. After marrying her husband, A, approximately 20 years ago, this nomadic way of life continued. They have five children, born in 1975, 1977, 1982, 1989 and 1994. 11.The applicant and A are illiterate, as, due to their way of life, they have received little, if any, formal education. They regard travelling as detrimental to both the health of their family and to the education of their children. The applicant suffers from depression, her husband from severe gout and several of her children are asthmatic. 12.In pursuit of a more stable existence, the applicant and her husband applied repeatedly throughout the years for places on many of the local private and official sites in Surrey including the official sites in Runnymede. Their applications proved unsuccessful as all the sites were full with long waiting lists. Consequently, the applicant and her husband had no option but to continue travelling. They were required to move on from roadside to roadside on innumerable occasions. For a period of time they stayed at a private site but when it was redeveloped as an official site, they were forced to move on as no space was available for them. In 1984 they stayed on a relative’s site for a period of time but were forced to leave. While the Government have suggested that in fact the applicants owned this land and that it received planning permission, this was denied by the applicant. According to the applicant, the land belonged to her brother. When, following his divorce, the land was ordered to be sold by the court as part of the financial settlement, the applicant had to leave. 13.In March 1993, the applicant bought land known as 111A Almners Road, Runnymede. It was a portion of a garden in a Green Belt area where there was already some residential development. The applicant moved a mobile home onto the land and took up residence with her family. In a declaration dated 7 March 1996 the applicant’s uncle, Jasper Smith, a member of the Gypsy Council and an employee of Surrey County Council, stated that he had attempted on numerous occasions prior to 1993 to obtain a site on an official site on behalf of the applicant without success. 14.On 25 June 1993, Runnymede Borough Council (“the Council”) rejected the applicant’s application to join the waiting list for rented council accommodation on the basis that they had not lived in the borough for a minimum of three years. The applicant alleged that by this time they had lived for many years in the Runnymede area, although they had been compelled to move on frequently from place to place. 15.In 1988, the High Court had granted a declaration that Surrey County Council was in breach of its duty under section 6 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 to provide provision for gypsies (R. v. Secretary of State ex parte Smith [1988] C.O.D. 3). In June 1989, the Secretary of State issued a direction under section 9 of the 1968 Act directing that 190 caravans should be accommodated. However, on 18 August 1989, the Borough of Runnymede was declared a designated area pursuant to section 12 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968. The area was designated on the basis that it was not expedient for adequate provision to be made for gypsies residing in or resorting to the borough. 16.The previous owner of 111A Almners Road, also a gypsy, had been refused planning permission in January 1993 to live on the land in a caravan on the basis that it conflicted with local and national planning policies. The Council considered that the stationing of a caravan would be detrimental to the character of the Green Belt. An enforcement notice had been issued requiring discontinuance of the unauthorised use. The applicant was aware of this situation and the fact that the previous owner had appealed to the Secretary of State for the Environment against the refusal of planning permission and the enforcement order. When the applicant purchased the land, she was advised that there was a special concession for granting planning permission to gypsies in Green Belt areas under Circular 28/77. Accordingly, she took over the appeal from the previous owner. 17.On 20 April 1993, a Public Enquiry was held. An Inspector appointed by the Department of Environment heard evidence and representations from the applicant and the Council. By a letter dated 3 June 1993, the Inspector dismissed the appeal. “10.The mobile home is situated on an enclosed plot of land fronting Almners Road, adjacent to No. 111. This land is separated from the adjacent house by a screen fence, which continues along the rear boundary of the appeal site. The site is contained on its other side boundary by a row of conifer trees. The land has a frontage of about 19 m to the road, most of which is formed by a hedge. … 12.From my inspection of the site and its surroundings and from the representations made I consider that there are two main issues… Firstly, whether the use of the land as a residential caravan site for a mobile home and associated operational development is appropriate to this part of the Metropolitan Green Belt; and, if not, secondly, whether there are very special circumstances that would justify the retention of inappropriate development in the Green Belt. 13.On the first issue, the use of land as a residential caravan site is not one of the purposes listed as being appropriate to the green belt in Planning Policy Guidance Note 2 (PPG2). However, policy C4 of the approved Surrey Structure Plan 1989 and policy PE2 of … the Replacement Structure Plan 1992 provide that gypsy caravan sites may be appropriate and necessary in the green belt, but they will not be considered acceptable as of right. 14.The appeals site lies within the south west sector of the Metropolitan Green Belt. This section is described as containing valuable green wedges which thrust inwards to the Thames west of Molesey. Lyne is a small settlement located within one of these wedges. Given its location within a narrow stretch of generally open countryside between Virginia Water and Chertsey I agree with the council that the appeals site lies within a particularly sensitive part of the green belt. 15.From my own observations I agree … that Almners Road comprises three distinct parts and that the appeals site lies within the significant gap between Nos 99 and 131 which is predominantly rural in character despite the presence of Nos 109 and 111. The rustic feel of the locality is enhanced by the woodlands to the rear of <the applicants’> land and the field on the opposite side… Notwithstanding the previous use of the land as part of the garden of No. 111, the unauthorised use and works represent an encroachment of additional development into a predominantly rural locality. It also contributes towards the coalescence of the nearby built up frontages on Almners Road and thereby the merger of nearby settlements. As a result I consider that the development subject to the appeals conflicts with the second and third objectives of government green belt policy listed in PPG2. … 16.Whilst the mobile home is set behind the front of the adjoining house and its range of visibility from the other direction on Almners Road is limited by conifers on its western boundary, it, and the related operational development is significantly different to the character of the touring caravans that are parked in some of the nearby gardens, which are incidental to the enjoyment of the residential curtilages within which they stand. Notwithstanding the support of some nearby residents, I consider that the discernible presence of the unauthorised development on the appeals site is harmful to the appearance of this mainly rural location. … In light of this and its particular impact on the aims of green belt policy, I conclude … that the use of the land for a residential caravan site for a mobile home and associated operational development is not appropriate to this part of the Metropolitan Green Belt. 17.Turning to my second issue, Circular 28/77 states that it may be necessary to accept the establishment of gypsy caravan sites in green belt areas and that there are advantages in gypsies providing their own sites. However, in designating Runnymede under the Caravan Sites Act 1968 on the grounds of expediency the Secretary of State gave significant weight to the extent of and characteristics of the green belt within the borough and the number of sites that had already been provided within these areas. … 18.Circular 28/77 advises that after a district or borough has been designated, authorities may have to be prepared to increase the provision they have made if there is a subsequent expansion of the gypsy population in their area and it is nearly 4 years since the designation of Runnymede in June 1989. However since then the quarterly surveys indicate that the number of vans parked illegally in the borough has tended to decline. Consequently, having regard to the reasons given for designation, there does not appear to be a case at this time for permitting additional gypsy caravan sites, in the green belt in Runnymede, contrary to policies H12 and H09, unless there are very special circumstances. 19.Having regard to the personal circumstances of <the applicants> none of the family requires regular hospital treatment and I do not consider the ailments of <the applicant and her husband> and two of their children are so exceptional or debilitating as to constitute compelling reasons for allowing inappropriate development in the green belt. Whilst I sympathise with <the applicants’> aim to have the two youngest children educated, only one of these is currently at school and there is no evidence that this locality is preferable to any other in terms of access to educational facilities. 20.I can appreciate <the applicants’> current desire to settle in one place but there is no specific reason why this has to be in the green belt. With regard to the consequences of <the applicants> having to vacate the site you state that they would have no alternative to reverting to their previous existence of moving from one unauthorised site to another, with consequent hardship for the family and inconvenience to the general public. In this respect … the borough and district councils have no record that <the applicants> have sought a place on any of the official sites and <the applicant> stated that she has not enquired whether there was any space on any of the sites occupied by her relatives. Additionally, it would be open to <the applicants> to seek priority housing from the Council. 21.… I accept that <the applicant and her husband> have lived and worked in this area for some time and that it might not be possible to accommodate <their> mobile home on any authorised site within the area. However, on the basis of the evidence at the inquiry I am not convinced that all avenues relating to possible alternative accommodation have been fully explored. I am not, therefore, assured that <the applicants> inevitably would have to return to living on unauthorised sites… In any event, I am not persuaded that such a consequence … together with any limited benefits that might arise in terms of the health and education of the family represent very special circumstances that would justify the retention of this inappropriate development in this particularly sensitive part of the Metropolitan Green Belt. …” 18.The applicant remained on her land in the caravan as the family had not been offered a place on an official campsite and thus had no alternative legal site to place their caravan. 19.On 29 July 1993, the applicant applied to the Council for planning permission to build a bungalow, of which there were already some 20 on Almners Road. The Council refused planning permission. On 16 September 1993, the applicant appealed this decision by written statement as she could not afford a public enquiry. 20.On 29 November 1993, an Inspector appointed by the Department of the Environment dismissed the appeal on similar grounds to the earlier appeal, namely that the bungalow was inappropriate within the Green Belt and that there were no special circumstances which would override the strong presumption against such a development, which in this case would contribute to the coalescence of existing developments and further diminish the rural character of the area. As a consequence, the applicant and her husband were in breach of the enforcement notice and liable to receive a summons issued by the Council for breach of Planning Regulations. 21.Injunction proceedings were instituted against the applicant and her family by the Council. On 5 September 1994, the Council obtained an injunction in the High Court requiring the applicant and her family to move off their land immediately. The applicant applied for judicial review of this decision and was granted limited legal aid. However, she received counsel’s opinion which advised that the application was doomed to failure. 22.In light of the new Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which came into force on 3 November 1994, the applicant, in fear of being on the roadside, applied to be placed on the local authority homeless list on 4 August 1994. The Council informed the applicant’s solicitors on 4November 1994 that the applicant had been placed on the list. 23.The applicant was offered accommodation in two flats in a town. However, the rent was excessively high and there was no facility to keep her husband’s van nor his tarmacadaming and landscape gardening equipment. Moreover, the environment next to a busy, treeless road was contrary to the country existence which she and her family had enjoyed all their lives. They have applied for accommodation in a more natural environment but no offer has yet been made. The Council had previously offered three alternative pieces of land which were subsequently withdrawn due to a methane gas leak, boggy ground and vicinity to a rubbish dump respectively. 24.The local authority has stated that, in the event that the applicant is forced to leave the site, the authority will provide temporary accommodation for her until permanent accommodation becomes available. However, in view of the restrictions on development within the Green Belt, all accommodation offered will be in urban areas. 25.The 1995 Annual Report from Surrey County Council planning department revealed that following the coming into force of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 the County Council no longer had an obligation to identify new gypsy caravan sites and that unless very special circumstances were proved it was unlikely that new sites would be allowed in Green Belt and sensitive areas. The statistics for 1994 showed that the official sites in the area catered for 44 caravans while there were another 26 caravans on unauthorised sites. 26.The applicant stated that in May 1997 the local authority decided to institute proceedings against her. Though no proceedings were issued, the Council threatened to do so from time to time and she lived under the threat of committal for contempt. The applicant’s husband continued to suffer from severe gout and was recently in hospital for treatment. He and the applicant both suffer from depression. Her eldest son, his wife, their son and baby lived with her, as well as three other children. The applicant’s children of school age were attending the local school regularly. The applicant stated that she continued to visit gypsy sites to see whether pitches were available but she has not been offered a pitch on any site and has not received any visits from the local authority. 27.In the Runnymede area, there were two local authority sites accommodating 50 caravans. In addition there were 12 caravans on authorised sites and 18 caravans on unauthorised sites. The applicant submitted that since the 1989 direction by the Secretary of State only 22 additional pitches were provided. Since 1996, there had been no increase in provision in either public or private sites and no decrease in the number of unlawful encampments. The applicant submitted that all the area of the Council was in the Metropolitan Green Belt area while the Government stated that only a large part of it was. The diagram and materials submitted from the Surrey Structure Plan 1994 indicates that 70% of the County was Green Belt, 20% urban and 10% countryside beyond the Green Belt, which includes some areas designated as areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONB) or designated landscape value (ADLV). Parts of the Green Belt area are also classed as AONB and ADLV. AONB and ADLV areas account for 40% of the County. According to the diagram, the Runnymede area consists entirely of Green Belt and urban centres. 28.The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991) (“the 1990 Act”) consolidated pre-existing planning law. It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land (section 57 of the 1990 Act). A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development (Restormel Borough Council v. Secretary of State for the Environment and Rabey [1982] Journal of Planning Law 785; John Davies v. Secretary of State for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [1989] Journal of Planning Law 601). 29.An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority, which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan, unless material considerations indicate otherwise (section 54A of the 1990 Act). 30.The 1990 Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of State in the event of a refusal of permission (section 78). With immaterial exceptions, the Secretary of State must, if either the appellant or the authority so desire, give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of State. It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence (see the Bryan v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-A, p. 11, § 21). There is a further appeal to the High Court on the ground that the Secretary of State’s decision was not within the powers conferred by the 1990 Act, or that the relevant requirements of the 1990 Act were not complied with (section 288). 31.If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission, the local authority may issue an “enforcement notice” if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations (section 172 (1) of the 1990 Act). 32.There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of State on the grounds, inter alia, that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question (section 174). As with the appeal against refusal of permission, the Secretary of State must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector. 33.Again there is a further right of appeal “on a point of law” to the High Court against a decision of the Secretary of State under section 174 (section 289). Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review. It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational (R.v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind [1991] Appeal Cases 696, 764 H-765 D). The High Court will also grant a remedy if the inspector’s decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors; or made for an improper purpose, in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument. However, the court of review cannot substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision-making authority. 34.Where any steps required by an enforcement notice to be taken are not taken within the period for compliance with the notice, the local authority may enter the land and take the steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so (section 178 of the 1990 Act). 35.The purpose of Green Belts and the operation of the policy to protect them is set out in the national policy document PPG 2 (January 1995). “1.1.The Government attaches great importance to Green Belts, which have been an essential element of planning policy for some four decades …>4.The fundamental aim of Green Belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open; the most important attribute of Green Belts is their openness. Green Belts can shape patterns of urban development at sub-regional and regional scale, and help to ensure that development occurs in locations allocated in development plans. They help to protect the countryside, be it in agricultural, forestry or other use. They can assist in moving towards more sustainable patterns of urban development.>5.There are five purposes in Green Belts: – to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built-up areas; – to prevent neighbouring towns from merging into one another; – to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment; – to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns; and – to assist in urban regeneration by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land. …>1.The essential characteristic of Green Belts is their permanence. Their protection must be maintained as far as can be seen ahead. …>1.The general policies controlling development in the countryside apply with equal force in Green Belts but there is, in addition, a general presumption against inappropriate development within them. Such development should not be approved, except in very special circumstances…>2.Inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt. It is for the applicant to show why permission should be granted. Very special circumstances to justify inappropriate development will not exist unless the harm by reason of inappropriateness, and any other harm, is clearly outweighed by other considerations. In view of the presumption against inappropriate development, the Secretary of State will attach substantial weight to the harm to the Green Belt when considering any planning application or appeal concerning such development.” 36.Part II of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (“the 1968 Act”) was intended to combat the problems caused by the reduction in the number of lawful stopping places available to gypsies as a result of planning and other legislation and social changes in the post-war years, in particular the closure of commons carried out by local authorities pursuant to section 23 of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960. Section 16 of the 1968 Act defined “gypsies” as: “persons of nomadic habit of life, whatever their race or origin, but does not include members of an organised group of travelling showmen, or of persons engaged in travelling circuses, travelling together as such”. 37.Section 6 of the 1968 Act provided that it should be the duty of local authorities: “to exercise their powers ... so far as may be necessary to provide adequate accommodation for gipsies residing in or resorting to their area”. 38.The Secretary of State could direct local authorities to provide caravan sites where it appeared to him to be necessary (section 9). 39.Where the Secretary of State was satisfied either that a local authority had made adequate provision for the accommodation of Gypsies, or that it was not necessary or expedient to make such provision, he could “designate” that district or county (section 12 of the 1968 Act). 40.The effect of designation was to make it an offence for any gypsy to station a caravan within the designated area with the intention of living in it for any period of time on the highway, on any other unoccupied land or on any occupied land without the consent of the occupier (section 10). 41.In addition, section 11 of the 1968 Act gave to local authorities within designated areas power to apply to a magistrates’ court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of section 10. 42.By the mid-1970s it had become apparent that the rate of site provision under section 6 of the 1968 Act was inadequate, and that unauthorised encampments were leading to a number of social problems. In February 1976, therefore, the Government asked Sir John Cripps to carry out a study into the operation of the 1968 Act. He reported in July 1976 (Accommodation for Gypsies: A report on the working of the Caravan Sites Act 1968, “the Cripps Report”). 43.Sir John estimated that there were approximately 40,000 Gypsies living in England and Wales. He found that: “Six-and-a-half years after the coming into operation of Part II of the 1968 Act, provision exists for only one-quarter of the estimated total number of gypsy families with no sites of their own. Three-quarters of them are still without the possibility of finding a legal abode ... Only when they are travelling on the road can they remain within the law: when they stop for the night they have no alternative but to break the law.” 44.The report made numerous recommendations for improving this situation. 45.Circular 28/77 was issued by the Department of the Environment on 25 March 1977. Its stated purpose was to provide local authorities with guidance on “statutory procedures, alternative forms of gypsy accommodation and practical points about site provision and management”. It was intended to apply until such time as more final action could be taken on the recommendations of the Cripps Report. 46.Among other advice, it encouraged local authorities to enable self-help by gypsies through the adoption of a “sympathetic and flexible approach to [Gypsies’] applications for planning permission and site licences”. Making express reference to cases where gypsies had bought a plot of land and stationed caravans on it only to find that planning permission was not forthcoming, it recommended that in such cases enforcement action not be taken until alternative sites were available in the area. 47.Circular 57/78, which was issued on 15 August 1978, stated, inter alia, that “it would be to everyone’s advantage if as many gypsies as possible were enabled to find their own accommodation”, and thus advised local authorities that “the special need to accommodate gypsies ... should be taken into account as a material consideration in reaching planning decisions”. 48.In addition, approximately £100 million was spent under a scheme by which one hundred per cent grants were made available to local authorities to cover the costs of creating gypsy sites. 49.Section 80 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (“the 1994 Act”), which came into force on 3 November 1994, repealed sections6-12 of the 1968 Act and the grant scheme referred to above. 50.Section 77 of the 1994 Act gives to a local authority power to direct an unauthorised camper to move. An unauthorised camper is defined as “a person for the time being residing in a vehicle on any land forming part of the highway, any other unoccupied land or any occupied land without the owner’s consent”. 51.Failure to comply with such a direction as soon as practicable, or re-entry upon the land within three months, is a criminal offence. Local authorities are able to apply to a magistrates’ court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of such a direction (section 78 of the 1994 Act). 52.In the case of R. v. Lincolnshire County Council, ex parte Atkinson (22 September 1995), Sedley J. referred to the 1994 Act as “Draconic” legislation. He commented that: “For centuries the commons of England provided lawful stopping places for people whose way of life was or had become nomadic. Enough common land had survived the centuries of enclosure to make this way of life still sustainable, but by s.23 of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 local authorities were given the power to close the commons to travellers. This they proceeded to do with great energy, but made no use of the concomitant powers given them by s.24 of the same Act to open caravan sites to compensate for the closure of the commons. By the Caravans Act 1968, therefore Parliament legislated to make the s.24 power a duty, resting in rural areas upon county councils rather than district councils… For the next quarter of a century there followed a history of non-compliance with the duties imposed by the Act of 1968, marked by a series of decisions of this court holding local authorities to be in breach of their statutory duty, to apparently little practical effect. The default powers vested in central government to which the court was required to defer, were rarely, if ever used. The culmination of the tensions underlying the history of non-compliance was the enactment of … the Act of 1994 …” 53.New guidance on gypsy sites and planning, in the light of the 1994 Act, was issued to local authorities by the Government in Circular 1/94 (5January 1994), which cancelled Circular 57/78 (see above). Councils were told that: “In order to encourage private site provision, local planning authorities should offer advice and practical help with planning procedures to gypsies who wish to acquire their own land for development. ... The aim should be as far as possible to help gypsies to help themselves, to allow them to secure the kind of sites they require and thus help avoid breaches of planning control.” (para. 20) However: “As with other planning applications, proposals for gypsy sites should continue to be determined solely in relation to land-use factors. Whilst gypsy sites might be acceptable in some rural locations, the granting of permission must be consistent with agricultural, archaeological, countryside, environmental, and Green Belt policies ...” (para. 22). It was indicated that as a rule it would not be appropriate to make provision for gypsy sites in areas of open land where development was severely restricted, for example Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Nor were gypsy sites regarded as being among those uses of land normally appropriate in a Green Belt (paragraph 13). 54.Further guidance issued by the Secretary of State dated 23November 1994 concerned the unauthorised camping by gypsies and the power to give a direction to leave the land (CJPOA above). Paragraphs 6-9 required local authorities to adopt “a policy of toleration towards unauthorised gypsy encampments: “6.... Where gypsies are camped unlawfully on council land and are not causing a level of nuisance which cannot be effectively controlled, an immediate forced eviction might result in unauthorised camping on a site elsewhere in the area which could give rise to greater nuisance. Accordingly, authorities should consider tolerating gypsies’ presence on the land for short periods and could examine the ways of minimising the level of nuisance on such tolerated sites, for example by providing basic services for gypsies e.g. toilets, a skip for refuse and a supply of drinking water.>Where gypsies are unlawfully camped on Government-owned land, it is for the local authority, with the agreement of the land-owning Department, to take any necessary steps to ensure that the encampment does not constitute a hazard to public health. It will continue to be the policy of the Secretaries of State that Government Departments should act in conformity with the advice that gypsies should not be moved unnecessarily from unauthorised encampments when they are causing no nuisance.>The Secretaries of State continue to consider that local authorities should not use their powers to evict gypsies needlessly. They should use their powers in a humane and compassionate fashion and primarily to reduce nuisance and to afford a higher level of protection to private owners of land.” 55.Paragraphs 10-13 further require local authorities to consider their obligations under other legislation before taking any decisions under the 1994 Act. These obligations include their duties concerning pregnant women and newly-born children, the welfare and education of children and the housing of homeless persons. In a judgment of 22 September 1995 (R.v.Lincolnshire County Council, ex parte Atkinson, R. v. Wealden District Council, ex parte Wales and R. v. Wealden District Council, ex parte Stratford, unreported), the High Court held that it would be an error of law for any local authority to ignore those duties which must be considered from the earliest stages. 56.In a letter dated 25 May 1998, the Department of the Environment drew to the attention of all local planning authorities in England that Circular 1/94 required local planning authorities to assess the need for gypsy accommodation in their areas and make suitable locational and/or criteria based policies against which to decide planning applications. The Government was concerned that this guidance had not been taken up. ACERT research (see below) had showed that 24% of local authorities (96) had no policy at all on gypsy sites and that many in the process of reviewing their plans at the time of the survey did not feel it necessary to include policies on gypsy provision. It was emphasised that it was important to include consideration of gypsy needs at an early stage in drawing up structure and development plans and the detailed policies should be provided. Compliance with this guidance was essential in fulfilling the Government’s objective that gypsies should seek to provide their own accommodation, applying for planning permission like everyone else. It was necessary, therefore, that adequate gypsy site provision be made in development plans to facilitate this process. 57.The Advisory Council for the Education of Romany and Other Travellers (ACERT) which carried out research sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions, noted in its report that since 1994 private site provision had increased by 30 caravans per year while the pace of public site provision had declined by 100 caravans, disclosing that the pace of private site provision had not increased sufficiently to counterbalance decreases in public site provision. Noting the increase of gypsies in housing and the increased enforcement powers under the 1994 Act, it questioned, if these trends continued, the extent to which the ethnic, cultural and linguistic identity of Gypsy and Traveller people would be protected. 58.The research looked, inter alia, at 114 refused private site applications, which showed that 97% related to land within the countryside and that 96% were refused on grounds relating to the amenity value (e.g.Green Belt, conservation area locations). Of the 50 gypsy site applicants interviewed, for most acquiring permission for their own land was an important factor in improving the quality of life, gaining independence and providing security. For many, the education of their children was another important reason for private site application. All save one had applied for permission retrospectively. 59.The report stated that the figures for success rates in 624 planning appeals showed that before 1992 the success rate had averaged 35% but had decreased since. Having regard however to the way in which data was recorded, the actual success rate was probably between 35% and 10% as given as the figures in 1992 and 1996 by the gypsy groups and Department of the Environment respectively. Notwithstanding the objectives of planning policy that local authorities make provision for gypsies, most local authorities did not identify any areas of land as suitable for potential development by gypsies and reached planning decisions on the basis of land-use criteria in the particular case. It was therefore not surprising that most gypsies made retrospective applications and that they had little success in identifying land on which local authority would permit development. Granting of permission for private sites remained haphazard and unpredictable. 60.In January 2000, the Department of the Environment, Regions and Transport survey on caravans England disclosed that of 13,134 caravans counted, 6,118 were accommodated on local authority pitches, 4,500 on privately owned sites and 2,516 on unauthorised sites. Of the latter, 684 gypsy caravans were being tolerated on land owned by non-gypsies (mainly local authority land) and 299 gypsy caravans tolerated on land owned by gypsies themselves. On these figures, about 1,500 caravans were therefore on unauthorised and untolerated sites while over 80% of caravans were stationed on authorised sites. 61.Local authority duties to the homeless were contained in Part VII of the Housing Act 1996, which came fully into force on 20 January 1997. Where the local housing authority was satisfied that an applicant was homeless, eligible for assistance, had a priority need (e.g. the applicant was a person with whom dependant children resided or was vulnerable due to old age, physical disability etc), and did not become homeless intentionally, the authority was required, if it did not refer the application to another housing authority, to secure that accommodation was available for occupation by the applicant for a minimum period of two years. Where an applicant was homeless, eligible for assistance and not homeless intentionally, but was not a priority case, the local housing authority was required to provide the applicant with advice and such assistance as it considered appropriate in the circumstances in any attempt he might make to secure that accommodation became available for his occupation. 62.This Convention, opened for signature on 1 February 1995, provides inter alia: “Article 1 The protection of national minorities and of the rights and freedoms of persons belonging to those minorities forms an integral part of the international protection of human rights, and as such falls within the scope of international co-operation. Article 4>The Parties undertake to guarantee to persons belonging to national minorities the right of equality before the law and of equal protection of the law. In this respect, any discrimination based on belonging to a national minority shall be prohibited.>The parties undertake to adopt, where necessary, adequate measures in order to promote, in all areas of economic, social, political and cultural life, full and effective equality between persons belonging to a national minority and those belonging to the majority; In this respect, they shall take due account of the specific conditions of the persons belonging to national minorities.>The measures adopted in accordance with paragraph 2 shall not be considered to be an act of discrimination. Article 5>The Parties undertake to promote the conditions necessary for persons belonging to national minorities to maintain and develop their culture, and to preserve the essential elements of their identity, namely their religion, language, traditions and cultural heritage.>Without prejudice to measures taken in pursuance of their general integration policy, the Parties shall refrain from policies or practices aimed at assimilation of persons belonging to national minorities against their will and shall protect these persons from any action aimed at such assimilation.” 63.The Convention entered into force on 1 February 1998. The United Kingdom signed the Convention on the date it opened for signature and ratified it on 15 January 1998. It entered into force for the United Kingdom on 1 May 1998. By 9 February 2000, it had been signed by 37 of the Council of Europe’s 41 member states and ratified by 28. 64.The Convention did not contain any definition of “national minority”. However the United Kingdom in its Report of July 1999 to the Advisory Committee concerned with the Convention accepted that gypsies are within the definition. 65.Recommendation 1203(1993) of the Parliamentary Assembly on Gypsies in Europe included the recognition that gypsies, as one of the very few non-territorial minorities in Europe, “need special protection”. In its general observations, the Assembly stated inter alia: “6.Respect for the rights of Gypsies, individual, fundamental and human rights and their rights as a minority, is essential to improve their situation.>Guarantees for equal rights, equal chances, equal treatment and measures to improve their situation will make a revival of Gypsy language and culture possible, thus enriching the European cultural diversity.” Its recommendations included: “xiv.member states should alter national legislation and regulations which discriminate directly or indirectly against Gypsies; … xviii.further programmes should be set up in the member states to improve the housing situation, education… of those Gypsies who are living in less favourable circumstances. …” 66.In 1998, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance issued General Policy Recommendation No. 3: Combating Racism and Intolerance against Roma/Gypsies. Its recommendations included: “… to ensure that discrimination as such, as well as discriminatory practices, are combated through adequate legislation and to introduce into civil law specific provisions to this end, particularly in the fields of … housing and education. … … to ensure that the questions relating to ‘travelling’ within a country, in particular, regulations concerning residence and town planning, are solved in a way which does not hinder the life of the persons concerned; …” 67.On 21 April 1994, the European Parliament passed a Resolution on the situation of Gypsies in the Community, calling on the governments of member states “to introduce legal, administrative and social measures to improve the social situation of Gypsies and Travelling People in Europe”; and recommending that “the Commission, the Council and the governments of Member States should do everything in their power to assist in the economic, social and political integration of Gypsies, with the objective of eliminating the deprivation and poverty in which the great majority of Europe’s Gypsy population still lives at the present time”. 68.Protection of minorities has become one of the preconditions for accession to the European Union. In November 1999, the European Union adopted “Guiding Principles” for improving the situation of Roma in candidate countries, based expressly on the recommendations of the Council of Europe’s Specialist Group of Roma/Gypsies and the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities’ recommendations. 69.The situation of Roma and Sinti has become a standard item on the Human Dimension section of the agenda of OSCE Review Conferences. Two structural developments – the Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the appointment of a High Commissioner for National Minorities – also concerned protection of Roma and Sinti as minorities. 70.On 7 April 2000, the High Commissioner’s Report on the Situation of Roma and Sinti in the OSCE Area was published. Part IV of the Report dealt with the living conditions of Roma, noting that while nomadism had been central to Romani history and culture a majority of Roma were now sedentary (one estimation gave 20% as nomadic, 20% as semi-nomadic, moving seasonally, while 60% were sedentary). This was particularly true of Central and Eastern Europe, where there had been in the past policies of forced sedentarization: “It must be emphasised that whether an individual is nomadic, semi-nomadic or sedentary should, like other aspects of his or her ethnic identity, be solely a matter of personal choice. The policies of some OSCE participating States have at times breached this principle, either by making a determination of a group’s fundamental lifestyle that is inconsistent with its members’ choices or by making it virtually impossible for individuals to pursue the lifestyle that expresses their group identity.” (pp. 98-99) 71.The Report stated that for those Roma who maintained a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle the availability of legal and suitable parking was a paramount need and precondition to the maintenance of their group identity. It observed however that even in those countries that encouraged or advised local authorities to maintain parking sites, the number and size of available sites was insufficient in light of the need: “… The effect is to place nomadic Roma in the position of breaking the law – in some countries, committing a crime – if they park in an unauthorized location, even though authorized sites may not be available.” (pp. 108-109) 72.The Report dealt specifically with the situation of Gypsies in the United Kingdom (pp. 109-114). It found: “Under current law, Gypsies have three options for lawful camping: parking on public caravan sites – which the Government acknowledges to be insufficient; parking on occupied land with the consent of the occupier; and parking on property owned by the campers themselves. The British Government has issued guidance to local authorities aimed at encouraging the last approach. In practice, however, and notwithstanding official recognition of their special situation and needs, many Gypsies have encountered formidable obstacles to obtaining the requisite permission to park their caravans on their own property …” (pp. 112-113). 73.Concerning the planning regime which requires planning permission for the development of land disclosed by the stationing caravans, it stated: “… This scheme allows wide play for the exercise of discretion – and that discretion has repeatedly been exercised to the detriment of Gypsies. A 1986 report by the Department of the Environment described the prospects of applying for planning permission for a Gypsy site as ‘a daunting one laced with many opportunities for failure’. In 1991, the last years in which the success of application rates was evaluated, it was ascertained that 90 per cent of applications for planning permission by Gypsies were denied. In contrast, 80 per cent of all planning applications were granted during the same period. It is to be noted that, as a category, Gypsy planning applications are relatively unique insofar as they typically request permission to park caravans in areas or sites which are subject to restriction by local planning authorities. As such, virtually all Gypsy planning applications are highly contentious. Nonetheless, the fact remains that there is inadequate provision or availability of authorized halting sites (private or public), which the high rate of denial of planning permission only exacerbates. Moreover, there are indications that the situation has deteriorated since 1994. … In face of these difficulties , the itinerant lifestyle which has typified the Gypsies is under threat.” (pp. 113-114) 74.The report’s recommendations included the following: “… in view of the extreme insecurity many Roma now experience in respect of housing, governments should endeavour to regularize the legal status of Roma who now live in circumstances of unsettled legality.” (pp. 126 and 162)",2001,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

48,001-72931,Grand Chamber,"12.The applicant was born in 1923 and lives in . 13.On 21 May 1986 Mr P. brought proceedings against the applicant in the Chiaravalle Centrale Magistrate’s Court for recognition of the existence of a right of way. 14.Preparation of the case for trial began on 28 May 1986 and on that date the Magistrate’s Court appointed an expert. Of the seven hearings listed between 8 October 1986 and 2 December 1987 three were devoted to organising expert evidence, two to an inspection of the premises by the pretore, two were adjourned by the court of its own motion and one was adjourned because the lawyers were on strike. On 27 July 1988 the Magistrate’s Court set the case down for hearing of oral submissions on 1March 1989. On that date the hearing was adjourned to 5 July 1989 at the parties’ request. Of the fifteen hearings listed between 2 May 1991 and 4June 1997 six were adjourned at the parties’ request, two at the request of the defendant, five by the court of its own motion – one of which was because the registry had not notified the applicant of the date of the hearing – one because the applicant had changed lawyer and another one to allow the registry to check that the stamps had duly been affixed to a number of documents in the case file. Judgment was reserved on 22October 1997. 15.In an order of 26 November 1997, which was not made at a hearing, the court declared the case reopened and requested the parties to file documents with the registry. On 4 March 1998 the court reserved judgment. 16. In an order of 9 April 1998 the court declared the case reopened, noted that the parties had not yet filed the documents requested and adjourned the case to 7 October 1998. On that date judgment was reserved. 17.In a judgment of the same date, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 16 August 1999, the Magistrate’s Court granted Mr P.’s application. 18.On 27 October 2000 the applicant appealed to the Catanzaro Court of Appeal. According to information provided by the applicant on 6 June 2005, the first hearing, which was to be held on 22 January 2001, was not held until 10 December 2001 following two adjournments of the court’s own motion and an adjournment of a hearing because the registry had not notified the parties of the hearing date. The parties made their submissions two hearings later, on 27 May 2002, and the hearing of final submissions was set down for 9 December 2003. That hearing was adjourned to 6 July 2004 following the transfer of the judge directing the preparations for trial, then to 18 January 2005. On that date judgment was reserved. 19.In a judgment of 21 February 2005, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 18 March 2005, the Court of Appeal set aside the first-instance court’s judgment and allowed the applicant’s appeal. According to information provided by the applicant on 14 October 2005, as the judgment had not been served the time allowed for appealing to the Court of Cassation was still running. 20.On an unspecified date in April 2002 the applicant lodged an application with the Salerno Court of Appeal under Law no.89 of 24March2001, known as the “Pinto Act”, complaining of the length of the above-described proceedings. He requested the court to rule that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to order the to pay compensation for the distress and other non-pecuniary damage sustained. The applicant claimed 13,000 euros (EUR) in compensation for distress and other non-pecuniary damage, and sought reimbursement of the costs and expenses but did not quantify them. 21.In a decision of 1 October 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 13 December 2002, the Court of Appeal found that the length of the proceedings had been excessive. It held as follows: The Court of Appeal awarded the applicant EUR3,500 on an equitable basis in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. In respect of costs and expenses, the Court of Appeal noted that the applicant had not given particulars of the claim. Having regard to the quantity and quality of the work done by the lawyer, it awarded him only half the sum he had considered due EUR516.46 (that is, EUR258.23) plus tax. That decision became final by 28January 2004 at the latest. The applicant obtained payment of the amounts due from the authorities on 19 November 2004. 22.In a letter of 20 October 2003 the applicant informed the Court of the outcome of the domestic proceedings and asked it to resume its examination of his application. 23.In a letter of 18 November 2003 the applicant informed the Court that he did not intend to appeal to the Court of Cassation because an appeal to that court could only be on points of law. 24.Award of just satisfaction in the event of a breach of the requirement to dispose of proceedings within a reasonable time and amendment to Article 375 of the Code of Civil Procedure Section 4 Time-limits and procedures for lodging applications Section 5 Communications Section 6 Transitional provisions Section 7 Financial provisions 25.On appeal from decisions delivered by the courts of appeal in “Pinto” proceedings, the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court (Sezioni Unite), gave four judgments (nos. 1338, 1339, 1340 and 1341) on 27November 2003, the texts of which were deposited with the registry on 26January 2004, quashing the appeal court’s decision and remitting the case for a rehearing. It held that “the case-law of the is binding on the Italian courts regarding the application of Law no. 89/2001”. In its judgment no. 1340 it affirmed, inter alia, the principle that 26.Extracts from the plenary Court of Cassation’s judgment no.1339 deposited with the registry on 26 January 2004>Case-law on the transfer of the right to compensation 27.The Court of Cassation held as follows: 28.The Court of Cassation judges noted that the right to compensation for a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time derived from the Pinto Act. The mechanism set in place by the European standard did not give applicants a cause of action before the domestic courts. Accordingly, the right to “just satisfaction” could neither be acquired nor transferred by a person who had already died by the time the Pinto Act came into force. The fact that the deceased had, while alive, lodged an application with the was not decisive. Section 6 of the Pinto Act did not constitute, as the applicants had maintained, a procedural standard bringing about a transfer of powers from the to the domestic courts. 29.In this case, which concerned the possibility or otherwise of transferring to heirs the right to compensation deriving from a breach of Article 6 § 1 on account of the length of the proceedings, the First Division of the Court of Cassation referred the case to the full court indicating that there was a conflict between the case-law authorities, that is, between the restrictive approach taken by the Court of Cassation in the earlier judgments regarding heirs and the Pinto Act and the four judgments delivered by the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, on 26 January 2004 to the extent that a less strict interpretation would lead to the conclusion that this right to compensation has existed since Italy ratified the European Convention on 4 August 1955. 30.In the case giving rise to the order mentioned above referring the case to the full court (see preceding paragraph), the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, established the following principles, thus preventing any further conflicting decisions being given by the courts: (i) Law no.848 of 4 August 1955, which ratified the Convention and made it enforceable, introduced into domestic legal order the fundamental rights, belonging to the category of rights conferred on the individual by public law, provided for in the first section of the Convention and which correspond to a large extent with those set forth in Article 2 of the Constitution. In that respect the Convention provisions are confirmatory and illustrative. ... (ii) It is necessary to reiterate the principle that the act giving rise to the right to reparation conferred by domestic law corresponds to a breach of the provision in Article 6 of the Convention, which is immediately applicable in domestic law. The distinction between the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, introduced by the European Convention on Human Rights (or even pre-existing as a constitutionally protected value), and the right to equitable reparation, which was allegedly introduced only by the Pinto Act, cannot be allowed in so far as the protection provided by the domestic courts does not depart from that previously offered by the Strasbourg Court, the domestic courts being bound to comply with the case-law of the European Court. ... (iii) Accordingly, the right to equitable reparation for loss sustained as a result of the unreasonable length of proceedings prior to the entry into force of Law no. 89/2001 must be acknowledged by the domestic courts even in favour of the heirs of a party who introduced the proceedings before that date, subject only to the condition that the claim has not already been lodged with the Strasbourg Court and the Court has not ruled on admissibility. ... 31.This judgment of the Court of Cassation concerned an appeal by the Ministry of Justice challenging the Court of Appeal’s award of non-pecuniary damages to a juristic person. The Court of Cassation referred to the decision reached in the case of Comingersoll v. Portugal [GC], no.35382/97, ECHR 2000IV and, after referring to the four judgments of the full court delivered on 26 January 2004, found that its own case-law was not in line with the European Court. It held that there was no legal barrier to awarding just satisfaction to “juristic” persons according to the criteria of the . Accordingly, since the Court of Appeal had correctly decided the case the appeal was dismissed. 32.The Court of Cassation made the following observations: 33.In the report CM/Inf/DH(2004)23, revised on 24 September 2004, the Ministers’ deputies made the following indications regarding an assessment of the Pinto remedy: 34.In this interim resolution the Ministers’ deputies indicated as follows: “The Committee of Ministers Noting ... 35.The European Commission for the efficiency of justice was set up at the Council of Europe by Resolution Res(2002)12 with the aim of (a) improving the efficiency and the functioning of the justice of member States with a view to ensuring that everyone within their jurisdiction can enforce their legal rights effectively, thereby generating increased confidence of the citizens in the justice system and (b) enabling a better implementation of the international legal instruments of the Council of Europe concerning efficiency and fairness of justice. 36.In its framework programme (CEPEJ (2004) 19 Rev 2 § (7) the CEPEJ noted that “the mechanisms which are limited to compensation are too weak and do not adequately incite the States to modify their operational process, and provide compensation only a posteriori in the event of a proven violation instead of trying to find a solution for the problem of delays.”",2006,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY
1.  DISMISSES THE GOVERNMENT’S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION AS TO THE NON-EXHAUSTION OF DOMESTIC REMEDIES;
2.  HOLDS THAT THE APPLICANT CAN CLAIM TO BE A “VICTIM” FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 34 OF THE CONVENTION;
3.  HOLDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION;

7,001-57980,Grand Chamber,"11. The applicant was arrested by police officers at 5.40 p.m. on 7January 1990 under section 14 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. Pursuant to Article 3 of the Criminal Evidence () Order 1988 (""the Order"") (see paragraph 27 below), he was cautioned by the police in the following terms: ""You do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so but I must warn you that if you fail to mention any fact which you rely on in your defence in court, your failure to take this opportunity to mention it may be treated in court as supporting any relevant evidence against you. If you do wish to say anything, what you say may be given in evidence."" In response to the police caution the applicant stated that he had nothing to say. 12. On arrival at Castlereagh Police Office at about 7 p.m., he refused to give his personal details to the officer in charge of the custody record. At 7.05 p.m. he was informed of his right to have a friend or relative notified of his detention and indicated that he did not require anyone to be so notified. At 7.06 p.m. he indicated that he wished to consult with a solicitor. At 7.30p.m. his access to a solicitor was delayed on the authority of a detective superintendent pursuant to section 15 (1) of the (Emergency Provisions) Act 1987 (""the 1987 Act""). The delay was authorised for a period of 48 hours from the time of detention (i.e. from 5.40p.m. on 7 January) on the basis that the detective superintendent had reasonable grounds to believe that the exercise of the right of access would, inter alia, interfere with the gathering of information about the commission of acts of terrorism or make it more difficult to prevent an act of terrorism (see paragraph 33 below). 13. At 9.27 p.m. on 7 January a police constable cautioned the applicant pursuant to Article 6 of the Order, inter alia, requesting him to account for his presence at the house where he was arrested. He was warned that if he failed or refused to do so, a court, judge or jury might draw such inference from his failure or refusal as appears proper. He was also served with a written copy of Article 6 of the Order (see paragraph 27 below). In reply to this caution the applicant stated: ""Nothing to say."" 14. At 10.40 p.m. he was reminded of his right to have a friend or relative notified of his detention and stated that he did not want anyone notified. He was also informed that his right of access to a solicitor had been delayed. He then requested consultation with a different firm of solicitors. A police inspector reviewed the reasons for the delay and concluded that the reasons remained valid. 15. The applicant was interviewed by police detectives at Castlereagh Police Office on twelve occasions during 8 and 9 January. In total he was interviewed for 21 hours and 39 minutes. At the commencement of these interviews he was either cautioned pursuant to Article 3 of the Order or reminded of the terms of the caution. 16. During the first ten interviews on 8 and 9 January 1990 the applicant made no reply to any questions put to him. He was able to see his solicitor for the first time at 6.33 p.m. on 9 January. At 7.10 p.m. he was interviewed again and reminded of the Article 3 caution. He replied: ""I have been advised by my solicitor not to answer any of your questions."" A final interview, during which the applicant said nothing, took place between 9.40 p.m. and 11.45 p.m. on 9 January. His solicitor was not permitted to be present at any of these interviews. 17. In May 1991 the applicant was tried by a single judge, the Lord Chief Justice of , sitting without a jury, for the offences of conspiracy to murder, the unlawful imprisonment, with seven other people, of a certain Mr L. and of belonging to a proscribed organisation, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). 18. According to the Crown, Mr L. had been a member of the IRA who had been providing information about their activities to the Royal Ulster Constabulary. On discovering that Mr L. was an informer, the IRA tricked him into visiting a house in on 5 January 1990. He was falsely imprisoned in one of the rear bedrooms of the house and interrogated by the IRA until the arrival of the police and the army at the house on 7 January 1990. It was also alleged by the Crown that there was a conspiracy to murder Mr L. as punishment for being a police informer. 19. In the course of the trial, evidence was given that when the police entered the house on 7 January, the applicant was seen by a police constable coming down a flight of stairs wearing a raincoat over his clothes and was arrested in the hall of the house. Mr L. testified that he was forced under threat of being killed to make a taped confession to his captors that he was an informer. He further said that on the evening of 7 January he had heard scurrying and had been told to take off his blindfold, that he had done so and had opened the spare bedroom door. He had then seen the applicant standing at the stairs. The applicant had told him that the police were at the door and to go downstairs and watch television. While he was talking to him the applicant was pulling tape out of a cassette. On a search of the house by the police items of clothing of Mr L. were subsequently found in the spare bedroom, whilst a tangled tape was discovered in the upstairs bathroom. The salvaged portions of the tape revealed a confession by Mr L. that he had agreed to work for the police and had been paid for so doing. At no time, either on his arrest or during the trial proceedings, did the applicant give any explanation for his presence in the house. 20. At the close of the prosecution case the trial judge, acting in accordance with Article 4 of the Order, called upon each of the eight accused to give evidence in their own defence. The trial judge informed them inter alia: ""I am also required by law to tell you that if you refuse to come into the witness box to be sworn or if, after having been sworn, you refuse, without good reason, to answer any question, then the court in deciding whether you are guilty or not guilty may take into account against you to the extent that it considers proper your refusal to give evidence or to answer any questions."" 21. Acting on the advice of his solicitor and counsel, the applicant chose not to give any evidence. No witnesses were called on his behalf. Counsel, with support from the evidence of a co-accused, D.M., submitted, inter alia, that the applicant’s presence in the house just before the police arrived was recent and innocent. 22. On 8 May 1991 the applicant was found guilty of the offence of aiding and abetting the unlawful imprisonment of Mr L. and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. He was acquitted on the remaining charges. 23. The trial judge rejected D.M.’s evidence (see paragraph 21 above) as untruthful. He considered that ""the surrounding facts, including the finding of the tangled tape in the bathroom with the broken cassette case, and the fact that, on entering the house some appreciable time after they arrived outside it and some appreciable time after they first knocked on the door, the police found Murray coming down the stairs at the time when all the other occupants of the house were in the living room, strongly confirm L’s evidence that after the police knocked on the door Murray was upstairs pulling the tape out of the cassette"". 24. In rejecting a submission by the applicant that Articles 4 and 6 of the Order did not operate to permit the court to draw an adverse inference against him, where, at the end of the Crown case, there was a reasonably plausible explanation for the accused’s conduct consistent with his innocence, the trial judge stated as follows: ""There can be debate as to the extent to which, before the making of the Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1988, a tribunal of fact in this jurisdiction was entitled to draw an adverse inference against an accused because he failed to give evidence on his own behalf, or to account for his presence at a particular place or to mention particular facts when questioned by the police. But I consider that the purpose of Article 4 and of Articles 3 and 6 of the 1988 Order was to make it clear that, whatever was the effect of the previous legal rules, a judge trying a criminal case without a jury, or a jury in a criminal case, was entitled to apply common sense in drawing inferences against the accused in the circumstances specified in Article 4, and in Articles 3 and 6 ... ... I think it is clear that the purpose of Article 4 is to permit the tribunal of fact to draw such inferences against the accused from his failure to give evidence in his own defence as common sense requires. The inference which it is proper to draw against an accused will vary from case to case depending on the particular circumstances of the case and, of course, the failure of the accused to give evidence on his own behalf does not in itself indicate guilt. Nor does the failure to mention particular facts when questioned or the failure to account for presence in a particular place in itself indicate guilt. But I consider that the intendment of ... Article 4 and Article 6 is to enable the tribunal of fact to exercise ordinary common sense in drawing inferences against an accused ... Therefore when I come to consider the case against the accused ... I propose to draw such inferences against [him] under Article 4 and under Article 6 as ordinary common sense dictates."" 25. In concluding that the applicant was guilty of the offence of aiding and abetting false imprisonment, the trial judge drew adverse inferences against the applicant under both Articles 4 and 6 of the Order. The judge stated that in the particular circumstances of the case he did not propose to draw inferences against the applicant under Article 3 of the Order. He stated furthermore: ""I accept the submissions of counsel for the accused that as demonstrated by his replies in cross-examination, L. is a man who is fully prepared to lie on oath to advance his own interests and is a man of no moral worth whatever. I, therefore, accept the further submissions of counsel for the accused that, unless his evidence were confirmed by other evidence, a court should not act on his evidence, particularly against accused persons in a criminal trial ... I now turn to consider the fifth count charging the false imprisonment of L. against the accused [the applicant]. For the reasons which I have already stated, I am satisfied that, as L. described in his evidence, [the applicant] was at the top of the stairs pulling the tape out of the cassette after the police arrived outside the house. I am also satisfied, for the reasons which I have already stated, that [the applicant] was in the house for longer than the short period described by his co-accused, [D.M.]. I am further satisfied that it is an irresistible inference that while he was in the house [the applicant] was in contact with the men holding L. captive and that he knew that L. was being held a captive. I also draw very strong inferences against [the applicant] under Article 6 of the 1988 Order by reason of his failure to give an account of his presence in the house when cautioned by the police on the evening of 7 January 1990 under Article 6, and I also draw very strong inferences against [the applicant] under Article 4 of the 1988 Order by reason of his refusal to give evidence in his own defence when called upon by the Court to do so. Therefore I find [the applicant] guilty of aiding and abetting the false imprisonment of L. because, knowing he was being held captive in the house, he was present in the house concurring in L. being falsely imprisoned. As Vaughan J. stated in R. v. Young ... [the applicant] was ‘near enough to give [his] aid and to give [his] countenance and assistance’."" 26. The applicant appealed against conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeal in . In a judgment of 7 July 1992, the court dismissed the applicant’s appeal holding, inter alia: ""... to suggest, with respect, that [the applicant] went into the house just as the police were arriving outside, immediately went upstairs, attempted to destroy a tape and then walked downstairs, and that this was the sum of his time and activity in the house defies common sense ... We are satisfied that it can reasonably be inferred that [the applicant] knew before he came to the house that [L.] was being held captive there. With this knowledge he assisted in the false imprisonment by directing the captive from the bedroom where he had been held and by giving him the directions and admonition [L.] said. Accordingly [the applicant] aided and abetted the crime. We do not accept that [L.] would have been free to leave the house, if the police and army had been taken in by the pretence of the television watching and had departed without making any arrests. We have no doubt that [L.] remained under restraint in the living room when the police were there and if they had left, he would have remained a prisoner to await the fate that his captors would determine. We consider that there was a formidable case against [the applicant]. He was the only one of the accused whom [L.] observed and identified as playing a positive part in the activities touching his captivity. [L.]’s evidence therefore called for an answer. No answer was forthcoming of any kind to the police or throughout the length of his trial. It was inevitable that the judge would draw ‘very strong inferences’ against him. The Crown case deeply implicated [the applicant] in the false imprisonment of [L.]."" 27. The 1988 Order includes the following provisions: Article 2 (4) and (7) ""(4) A person shall not be committed for trial, have a case to answer or be convicted of an offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure or refusal as is mentioned in Article 3 (2), 4 (4), 5 (2) or 6 (2). ... (7) Nothing in this Order prejudices any power of a court, in any proceedings, to exclude evidence (whether by preventing questions from being put or otherwise) at its discretion."" Article 3 ""Circumstances in which inferences may be drawn from accused’s failure to mention particular facts when questioned, charged, etc. (1) Where, in any proceedings against a person for an offence, evidence is given that the accused (3) Subject to any directions by the court, evidence tending to establish the failure may be given before or after evidence tending to establish the fact which the accused is alleged to have failed to mention. ..."" Article 4 ""Accused to be called upon to give evidence at trial (1) At the trial of any person (other than a child) for an offence paragraphs (2) to (7) apply unless (2) Before any evidence is called for the defence, the court (3) If the accused or (4) The court or jury, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may (5) This Article does not render the accused compellable to give evidence on his own behalf, and he shall accordingly not be guilty of contempt of court by reason of a refusal to be sworn. ..."" Article 6 ""Inferences from failure or refusal to account for presence at a particular place (1) Where (2) Where this paragraph applies (3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply unless the accused was told in ordinary language by the constable when making the request mentioned in paragraph (1) (c) what the effect of this Article would be if he failed or refused to do so. (4) This Article does not preclude the drawing of any inference from the failure or refusal of a person to account for his presence at a place which could properly be drawn apart from this Article. ..."" 28. In the case of R. v. Kevin Sean Murray (sub nom. v.Director of Public Prosecutions), the House of Lords considered the effect of Article 4 of the Order ([1993] 97 Criminal Appeal Reports 151). In the leading judgment of the House of Lords, Lord Slynn stated that: 29. He added: ""... This does not mean that the court can conclude simply because the accused does not give evidence that he is guilty. In the first place the prosecutor must establish a prima facie case - a case for him to answer. In the second place in determining whether the accused is guilty the judge or jury can draw only ‘such inference from the refusal as appear proper’. As Lord Diplock said in Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor at p. 153B: There must thus be some basis derived from the circumstances which justify the inference. If there is no prima facie case shown by the prosecution there is no case to answer. Equally if parts of the prosecution had so little evidential value that they called for no answer, a failure to deal with those specific matters cannot justify an inference of guilt. On the other hand if aspects of the evidence taken alone or in combination with other facts clearly call for an explanation which the accused ought to be in a position to give, if an explanation exists, then a failure to give any explanation may as a matter of common sense allow the drawing of an inference that there is no explanation and that the accused is guilty ..."" 30. Lord Mustill in R. v. Kevin Sean Murray (cited above) stated that the expression ""a prima facie case"" ""was intended to denote a case which is strong enough to go to a jury - i.e. a case consisting of direct evidence which, if believed and combined with legitimate inferences based upon it, could lead a properly directed jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt ... that each of the essential elements of the offence is proved"". 31. Even if a prima facie case is established, the trial judge has a discretion whether or not to draw inferences on the facts of the particular case. In the present case, the Court of Appeal indicated that if a judge accepted that an accused did not understand the warning given in the caution required by Article 6 or if he had doubts about it ""we are confident that he would not activate Article 6 against him"". 32. In R. v. Director of Serious Fraud Office, ex parte Smith [1992] 3 Weekly Law Reports 66, Lord Mustill stated that it was necessary to analyse which aspect of the right to silence is involved in any particular situation, because ""... In truth it does not denote any single right, but rather refers to a disparate group of immunities, which differ in nature, origin, incidence and importance, and also as to the extent to which they have already been encroached upon by statute."" Amongst the group of immunities which were covered by the expression ""right to silence"" Lord Mustill identified the following: ""(1) A general immunity, possessed by all persons and bodies, from being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions posed by other persons or bodies. (2) A general immunity, possessed by all persons and bodies, from being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions the answers to which may incriminate them. (3) A specific immunity, possessed by all persons under suspicion of criminal responsibility whilst being interviewed by police officers or others in similar positions of authority, from being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions of any kind. (4) A specific immunity, possessed by accused persons undergoing trial, from being compelled to give evidence, and from being compelled to answer questions put to them in the dock. (5) A specific immunity, possessed by persons who have been charged with a criminal offence, from having questions material to the offence addressed to them by police officers or persons in a similar position of authority. (6) A specific immunity ..., possessed by accused persons undergoing trial, from having adverse comment made on any failure (a) to answer questions before the trial, or (b) to give evidence at the trial."" 33. Section 15 of the (Emergency Provisions) Act 1987 provides as relevant: ""15. Right of access to legal advice (1) A person who is detained under the terrorism provisions and is being held in police custody shall be entitled, if he so requests, to consult a solicitor privately. (2) A person shall be informed of the right conferred on him by subsection (1) as soon as practicable after he has become a person to whom the subsection applies. (3) A request made by a person under subsection (1), and the time at which it is made, shall be recorded in writing unless it is made by him while at a court and being charged with an offence. (4) If a person makes such a request, he must be permitted to consult a solicitor as soon as practicable except to the extent that any delay is permitted by this section. ... (8) An officer may only authorise a delay in complying with a request under subsection (1) where he has reasonable grounds for believing that the exercise of the right conferred by that subsection at the time when the detained person desires to exercise it - 34. The delay must be authorised by a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent (section 15, subsection (5) (a)) and the detained person must be told the reason for the delay (subsection (9) (a)). The maximum delay is 48 hours. 35. The courts in have taken the view that the provisions of the 1988 Order should not be read subject to section 15 of the 1987 Act above. In the case of R. v. Dermot Quinn (judgment of the Belfast Crown Court of 23 December 1991), the trial judge rejected a submission to the effect that an adverse inference under Article 3 of the 1988 Order should not be drawn where the accused had asked for access to his solicitor but been interviewed by the police before his solicitor arrived to advise him. He noted that the 1988 Order had come into force after section 15 of the 1987 Act and considered that Parliament had not intended that an inference dictated by common sense which was permitted by Article 3 of the 1988 Order should not be drawn because of the right to access to legal advice given by section 15. In its judgment of 17 September 1993, the Court of Appeal in upheld the trial judge’s ruling, finding no unfairness in the circumstances of the case in drawing an adverse inference in respect of the accused’s failure to respond to questions by the police before the receipt of legal advice from his solicitor. The court commented that a breach of section 15 might in certain circumstances allow the trial judge in his discretion to refuse to draw an adverse inference under Article 3 of the 1988 Order.",1996,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT
1.   HOLDS BY FOURTEEN VOTES TO FIVE THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARAS. 1 AND 2 (ART. 6-1, ART. 6-2) OF THE CONVENTION ARISING OUT OF THE DRAWING OF ADVERSE INFERENCES ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPLICANT’S SILENCE;

185,001-81359,Grand Chamber,"8.The applicants were born in 1933 and 1939 and live in and Petersfield respectively.>On 7 April 2000, at 4.55 a.m., a vehicle of which the applicant was the registered keeper, registration number T61 TBX, was caught on a speed camera driving at 69 miles per hour (mph) on the M11 motorway where the temporary speed limit was 40 mph. 10.On 17 April 2000, the police camera enforcement unit of the Essex Constabulary wrote to the applicant: “I have photographic evidence that the driver of T61 TBX failed to comply with the speed limit ... It is intended to institute proceedings against the driver for the offence of failing to comply with the speed limit ... You have been named as the driver of the vehicle at the time of the alleged offence and have a legal obligation to comply with the provisions of the notice contained on page 2. I must warn you that if you fail to comply with this demand within 28 days you will commit an offence and be liable on conviction to a maximum penalty similar to that of the alleged offence itself – a fine of £1,000 and 3-6 penalty points.” 11.The attached Notice of Intended Prosecution informed the applicant that it was intended to institute proceedings against the driver of the vehicle. He was asked to furnish the full name and address of the driver of the vehicle on the relevant occasion or to supply other information that was in his power to give and which would lead to the driver’s identification. He was again informed that a failure to provide information was a criminal offence under section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. 12.The applicant answered the letter confirming that he was the driver at the relevant time. 13.On 27 March 2001 the applicant was summoned to attend North Essex Magistrates’ Court where he was tried for driving in excess of the speed limit. Prior to the trial, the applicant sought to exclude the confession made in response to the Notice of Intended Prosecution, relying on sections76 and 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 read in conjunction with Article 6 of the Convention. His application was refused in the light of the decision of the Privy Council in Brown v. Stott [2001]2WLR 817. Thereafter the prosecution relied upon the photograph of the speeding vehicle and the admission obtained as a result of the section172 demand. The applicant was convicted and fined 100 pounds sterling (GBP), ordered to pay GBP 150 costs and his licence was endorsed with six penalty points. 14.On 11 April 2001 the applicant asked the magistrates to state a case for the opinion of the High Court: “Whether in the circumstances of this case, the admission that the defendant was indeed the driver should have been excluded under sections 76 and 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 having regard to the Human Rights Act and the recent cases decided by the European Court as he had been obliged to incriminate himself?” 15.On 23 April 2001 the magistrates’ clerk informed the applicant that the magistrates refused to state a case as the issue had already been decided definitively by the Privy Council in Brown v. Stott (cited above) and by the High Court in Director of Public Prosecutions v. ([2001] EWHC Admin 198). 16.On 19 October 2001 the applicant’s application for judicial review of the magistrates’ decision was refused. 17.A car of which the applicant was the registered keeper was caught on speed camera on 12 June 2001 driving at 47 mph where the speed limit was 30 mph. 18.On 19 June 2001 the Surrey Police sent the applicant a Notice of Intended Prosecution in the following terms: “In accordance with section 1, Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, I hereby give you notice that proceedings are being considered against the driver of Alvis motor vehicle registration mark EYX 622 ... This allegation is supported by means of photographic/recorded video evidence. You are recorded as the owner/keeper/driver or user for the above vehicle at the time of the alleged offence, and you are required to provide the full name and address of the driver at the time and location specified. Under section 172 of the Road Traffic Act you are required to provide the information specified within 28 days of receipt of this notice. Failure to supply this information may render you liable to prosecution. The penalty on conviction for failure to supply the information is similar to that for the offence itself, i.e. a fine and penalty points.” 19.On 17 July 2001 the applicant wrote to the Surrey Police invoking his right to remain silent and privilege against self-incrimination. 20.On 18 July 2001 the Surrey Police informed the applicant that the appeal in Brown v. Stott, cited above, held that section 172 did not infringe the said rights. 21.The applicant refused to supply the information. 22.On 28 August 2001 the applicant was summoned to the Magistrates’ Court for failing to comply with section 172(3) of the Road Traffic Act 1988. He obtained an adjournment. 23.On 9 November 2001 the Magistrates’ Court agreed to a further postponement, apparently with reference to the applicant’s proceeding with an application in . The applicant wrote to the Court on 15November 2001, relying on Article 6 §§ 1 and 2 of the Convention. 24.On 8 February 2002 the Magistrates’ Court cancelled the postponement and fixed the trial for 15 April 2002, on which date the applicant was convicted and fined GBP 750 with GBP 250 costs and three penalty points. He states that the fine was substantially heavier than that which would have been imposed if he had pleaded guilty to the speeding offence. 25.Section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”) deals with the duty to give information of a driver of a vehicle in certain circumstances. Subsection (1) refers to the traffic offences to which the section applies. They include parking on a cycle track (under section 21 of the 1988 Act) and causing death by reckless driving (section 1), offences under a number of other provisions, including speeding, and manslaughter by the driver of a motor vehicle. Subsection 2 provides: “Where the driver of a vehicle is alleged to be guilty of an offence to which this section applies – (a)the person keeping the vehicle shall give such information as to the identity of the driver as he may be required to give by or on behalf of a chief officer of police, and (b)any other person shall if required as stated above give any information which it is in his power to give and may lead to identification of the driver.” Subsection 3 provides: “Subject to the following provisions, a person who fails to comply with a requirement under subsection (2) above shall be guilty of an offence.” Subsection 4 provides: “A person shall not be guilty of an offence by virtue of paragraph (a) of subsection(2) above if he shows that he did not know and could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained who the driver of the vehicle was.” 26.A person guilty of an offence under subsection 3 can be disqualified or have his licence endorsed with three penalty points; he may also be fined up to level three on the standard scale, that is, GBP 1,000. 27.Section 12(1) of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 provides that on summary trial for a relevant offence, including speeding offences, a statement in writing signed by the accused under section 172(2) of the 1988 Act that he was the driver of the vehicle on that occasion may be accepted as evidence of that fact. 28.Section 76 provides “(1)In any proceedings a confession made by an accused person may be given in evidence against him in so far as it is relevant to any matter in issue in the proceedings and is not excluded by the court in pursuance of this section; (2)If, in any proceedings where the prosecution proposes to give in evidence a confession made by an accused person, it is represented to the court that the confession was or may have been obtained – (a)by oppression of the person who made it; or (b)in consequence of anything said or done which was likely, in the circumstances existing at the time, to render unreliable any confession which might be made by him in consequence thereof, the court shall not allow the confession to be given in evidence against him except in so far as the prosecution proves to the court beyond reasonable doubt that the confession (notwithstanding that it may be true) was not obtained as aforesaid. ...” 29.Section 78(1) provides: “In any proceedings the court may refuse to allow evidence on which the prosecution proposes to rely to be given if it appears to the court that, having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.” 30.In Brown v. Stott, cited above, the Privy Council considered the case of a woman arrested for shoplifting in the vicinity of a car that appeared to be hers. She was breathalysed and tested positive for alcohol consumption. With a view to ascertaining whether she had been guilty of driving her car while under the influence of alcohol (contrary to section 5 of the 1988 Act), the police served her with a section 172 notice. The Procurator Fiscal sought to use her answer that she had been driving as the basis for a prosecution for driving with excess alcohol. The High Court of Justiciary allowed the defendant’s appeal, finding that the prosecution could not rely on evidence of the admission which she had been compelled to make. 31.On appeal by the Procurator Fiscal, the Privy Council found that the use of the admission did not infringe the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention. Lord Bingham of Cornhill, giving the leading judgment, held, inter alia: “The high incidence of death and injury on the roads caused by the misuse of motor vehicles is a very serious problem common to almost all developed societies. The need to address it in an effective way, for the benefit of the public, cannot be doubted. Among other ways in which democratic societies have sought to address it is by subjecting the use of motor vehicles to a regime of regulation and making provision for enforcement by identifying, prosecuting and punishing offending drivers. Materials ... incomplete though they are, reveal different responses to the problem of enforcement. Under some legal systems (Spain, Belgium and are examples) the registered owner is presumed to be the driver guilty of minor traffic infractions unless he shows that some other person was driving at the relevant time or establishes some other ground of exoneration. There being a clear public interest in enforcement of road traffic legislation the crucial question in this case is whether section 172 represents a disproportionate response, or one that undermines a defendant’s right to a fair trial, if an admission of being the driver is relied on at trial. I do not for my part consider that section 172, properly applied, does represent a disproportionate response to this serious social problem, nor do I think that reliance on the respondent’s admission in the present case, would undermine her right to a fair trial. I reach that conclusion for a number of reasons.>Section 172 provides for the putting of a single, simple question. The answer cannot of itself incriminate the suspect, since it is not without more an offence to drive a car. An admission of driving may, of course, as here, provide proof of a fact necessary to convict, but the section does not sanction prolonged questioning about facts alleged to give rise to criminal offences such as understandably was held to be objectionable in Saunders, and the penalty for declining to answer under the section is moderate and non-custodial. There is in the present case no suggestion of improper coercion or oppression such as might give rise to unreliable admissions and so contribute to a miscarriage of justice, and if there were evidence of such conduct the trial judge would have ample power to exclude evidence of the admission.>While the High Court was entitled to distinguish ... between the giving of an answer under section 172 and the provision of physical samples, and had the authority of the European Court in Saunders ... for doing so, this distinction should not in my opinion be pushed too far. It is true that the respondent’s answer whether given orally or in writing would create new evidence which did not exist until she spoke or wrote. In contrast, it may be acknowledged, the percentage of alcohol in her blood was a fact, existing before she blew into the breathalyser machine. But the whole purpose of requiring her to blow into the machine (on pain of a criminal penalty if she refused) was to obtain evidence not available until she did so and the reading so obtained could, in all save exceptional circumstances, be enough to convict a driver of an offence ... [I]t is not easy to see why a requirement to answer a question is objectionable and a requirement to undergo a breath test is not. Yet no criticism is made of the requirement that the respondent undergo a breath test.>All who own or drive motor cars know that by doing so they subject themselves to a regulatory regime. This regime is imposed not because owning or driving cars is a privilege or indulgence granted by the State but because the possession and use of cars (like, for example, shotguns ...) are recognised to have the potential to cause grave injury. It is true that section 172(2)(b) permits a question to be asked of ‘any other person’ who, if not the owner or driver, might not be said to have impliedly accepted the regulatory regime, but someone who was not the owner or driver would not incriminate himself whatever answer he gave. If, viewing this situation in the round, one asks whether section 172 represents a disproportionate legislative response to the problem of maintaining road safety, whether the balance between the interests of the community at large and the interests of the individual is struck in a manner unduly prejudicial to the individual, whether (in short) the leading of this evidence would infringe a basic human right of the respondent, I would feel bound to give negative answers. If the present argument is a good one it has been available to British citizens since 1966, but no one in this country has to my knowledge, criticised the legislation as unfair at any time up to now.” The decision was adopted by the English High Court in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Wilson, cited above.",2007,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT
1.  HOLDS BY FIFTEEN VOTES TO TWO THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION;
2.  HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT NO SEPARATE ISSUE ARISES UNDER ARTICLE 6 § 2 OF THE CONVENTION.
"
148,001-58197,Grand Chamber,"9.Mr İbrahim Incal, a Turkish national born in 1953, lives in İzmir. A lawyer by profession, he was at the material time a member of the executive committee of the İzmir section of the People’s Labour Party (“the HEP”). That party, which was represented in the National Assembly, was dissolved by the Constitutional Court on 14 July 1993. 10.On 1 July 1992 the executive committee decided to distribute in the İzmir constituency a leaflet criticising the measures taken by the local authorities, in particular against small-scale illegal trading and the sprawl of squatters’ camps around the city. The title of the leaflet, of which ten thousand copies were printed, was “To all democratic patriots!”, and the text read as follows: “In the last few days a campaign aimed at ‘DRIVING THE KURDS OUT OF THE CITIES’ has been launched in İzmir against the Kurdish population by a combination of prefecture, security police and town hall. In this campaign İzmir has been designated a pilot-city. The first stage was the operation [against] street traders, stallkeepers and mussel sellers, whom they tried to hide away on the ground that it was necessary to smarten up the city and ease traffic congestion. The purpose of this operation was to impose an ‘economic blockade’ on our, mainly Kurdish, fellow citizens who make their living through these activities, condemning them to destitution and starvation. In this way the masses were to be frightened, oppressed and compelled to return to their province of origin. Before the ‘DRIVING THE KURDS OUT’ campaign began the organisational and psychological ground had already been prepared by leaflets signed by ‘Patriotic inhabitants of İzmir’ and handed out in large numbers for weeks by ‘obscure forces’. These leaflets incited hostility against the Kurdish population in particular and stirred up anti-Kurdish feelings. This led to racist and chauvinistic anti-Kurdish attitudes through propaganda saying: ‘Don’t give employment or housing to the Kurds. Don’t speak to them, don’t let your daughters marry them and don’t marry one yourself. Smash the Kurds.’ That is how the psychological foundations were laid down, the preparations for the future offensives. Although these leaflets were handed out in broad daylight, those responsible – and nobody knows why – were never arrested. But the campaign was by no means limited to the operation against street traders, stallkeepers and mussel sellers. The second prong was ‘Operation shantytown’. The same combination of prefecture, security police and town hall launched the demolition of the squatters’ camps. It began in Yamanlar and Şemikler and continued in Gaziemir, [all] shantytown districts inhabited mainly by Kurds, who, before the elections, were regarded by the parties in favour of the status quo as a source of votes. Those who had encouraged the mushrooming of the shantytowns by dishonestly promising freedom to build in exchange for votes and those who, with the local mafia, had appropriated public land this time set about the ferocious destruction of these huts to oppress and intimidate the Kurds and force them to go back home. The Kurdish and Turkish proletarian people suddenly and without any warning saw the huts they had run into debt to build, with so many sacrifices made by cutting down on their children’s food, collapsing about their ears. That is how they are trying to oppress the Kurdish and Turkish people and drive them into distress and despair. IT’S STATE TERROR AGAINST TURKISH AND KURDISH PROLETARIANS! It is certain that these demolitions, which began in Yamanlar and are still continuing in Gaziemir, will soon spread to İzmir’s other shantytowns. The State is testing the people’s reactions and will to resist by causing various kinds of destruction. Passivity as a form of defence against this devastation has encouraged the State to commit further kinds of destruction. In conclusion: The ‘Driving-the-Kurds-Out policy’ forms part of the SPECIAL WAR being conducted in the country at present against the Kurdish people. It is one of the mechanisms of that war, the way it impinges on the cities. Because the methods used are the same, namely enslavement, violence, terror and oppression through compulsion. It is a psychological war. While, in the country, they are trying to oppress and silence the people through counter-insurgency tactics, special patrols, village guards, the SS decree and every [other] form of State terror, in İzmir they want to achieve the same aim by depriving our fellow citizens of their means of subsistence and in the end by knocking their houses down about their ears. The methods used, although different in form, are in the final analysis mechanisms serving the purposes of the special war. It is the urban form of the special war. TO ALL DEMOCRATIC PATRIOTS! The way to nullify these insults to the cities is to set up NEIGHBOURHOOD COMMITTEES BASED ON THE PEOPLE’S OWN STRENGTH. We call on all Kurdish and Turkish democratic patriots to assume their responsibilities and oppose this special war being waged against the proletarian people. LONG LIVE THE BROTHERHOOD OF NATIONS! STOP THE SPECIAL WAR BEING SPREAD INTO THE CITIES!” 11.By a letter of 2 July 1992, accompanied by a copy of the leaflet in question, the president of the HEP informed the İzmir prefecture of the executive committee’s decision (see paragraph 10 above) and asked for permission to implement it. 12.The İzmir security police, to whom this request had been referred, considered that the leaflet contained separatist propaganda capable of inciting the people to resist the government and commit criminal offences. On 3 July 1992 they asked the Principal Public Prosecutor attached to the İzmir National Security Court (“the public prosecutor”, “the National Security Court”) to state his opinion as to whether the contents of the leaflet contravened the law. 13.On the same day, at the request of the public prosecutor’s office, a substitute judge of the National Security Court issued an injunction ordering the seizure of the leaflets and prohibiting their distribution. The police searched the HEP’s premises in İzmir, first at the headquarters, where the party leaders handed over, without demur, nine thousand copies of the leaflet which were still parcelled up, and then at the Buca district office, where the thousand remaining copies were seized. 14.Still on 3 July 1992 the public prosecutor’s office opened a criminal investigation against the HEP’s local leaders and the members of its executive committee, including the applicant. 15.On 27 July 1992 the public prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings in the National Security Court against the applicant and the other eight members of the HEP committee who had taken part in the decision of 1 July 1992 (see paragraph 10 above). Citing the text of the leaflet, he accused them of attempting to incite hatred and hostility through racist words and asked the court to apply Articles 312 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code, section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) and additional section 4 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680) (see paragraphs 21, 23 and 24 below). He also asked the court to order confiscation of the leaflets. 16.On 9 February 1993 the National Security Court, composed of three judges, one of whom was a member of the Military Legal Service, found the applicant guilty of the offences charged and sentenced him to six months and twenty days’ imprisonment and a fine of 55,555 Turkish liras. It also ordered the confiscation of the leaflets and disqualified him from driving for fifteen days. In its interpretation of the wording of the leaflet, the National Security Court accepted the public prosecutor’s oral submissions entirely, except for that part which related to the applicability of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713). It noted in particular that the leaflet suggested recourse to resistance against the police and the establishment of “neighbourhood committees”, which it held to be illegal forms of protest. It further held that the offence had been intentionally committed, since the accused had not contested either the existence or wording of the text on which the charge was based. With regard to the severity of the sentence, it observed that although commission of the offence through the medium of print was an aggravating circumstance, it was necessary to take into account the accused’s good faith and the fact that the authorities had been able to lay hands on the leaflets before they had been distributed. 17.On 9 March 1993 the applicant and the other convicted persons appealed to the Court of Cassation. In their notice of appeal they asked for a public hearing to be held and challenged the National Security Court’s interpretation of the leaflet and its refusal to commute the prison sentence to a fine. 18.On 20 May the Principal Public Prosecutor attached to the Court of Cassation forwarded the case file together with an opinion couched in a standard form of words – which was not communicated to Mr Incal – asking the court to uphold the judgment. 19.In a judgment of 6 July 1993 the Court of Cassation upheld all the operative provisions of the impugned judgment, after observing that, regard being had to the nature and length of the sentence imposed at first instance, it was not necessary to hold a hearing. 20.On 23 August 1993 the prosecuting authorities decided, at the applicant’s request, to stay execution of the prison sentence for four months. 21.The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows: Article 311 § 2 “Public incitement to commit an offence Where the incitement [to commit an offence] is done by means of mass communication, of whatever type, by tape recordings, gramophone records, newspapers, press publications or other published material, by the circulation or distribution of printed papers or by the placing of placards or posters in public places, the terms of imprisonment to which convicted persons are liable shall be doubled…” Article 312 “Non-public incitement to commit an offence Whosoever expressly praises or condones an act punishable by law as an offence or incites the population to break the law shall be sentenced to between six months’ and two years’ imprisonment and a … fine of between six thousand and thirty thousand liras. Whosoever expressly arouses hatred and hostility in society on the basis of a distinction between social classes, races or religions, or one based on allegiance to a particular denomination or region, shall be sentenced to between one and three years’ imprisonment and a fine of between nine thousand and thirty-six thousand liras. If this incitement is done in a manner likely to endanger public safety, the sentence shall be increased [by one third to one half]. The penalties to be imposed on those who have committed the above-mentioned offences by the means listed in Article 311 § 2 shall be doubled.” 22.A conviction under Article 312 § 2 entails further consequences, particularly with regard to the exercise of certain activities governed by special legislation. For example, persons convicted of an offence under that section may not found associations (Law no. 2908, section 4(2)(b)) or trade unions, nor may they be members of the executive committee of a trade union (Law no. 2929, section 5). They are also forbidden to found or join political parties (Law no. 2820, section 11(5)) and may not stand for election to Parliament (Law no. 2839, section 11(f3)). In addition, if the sentence imposed exceeds six months’ imprisonment, the convicted person is debarred from entering the civil service, provided that the offence has been committed intentionally (Law no. 657, section 48(5)). 23.Additional section 4(1) of the Press Act (Law no. 5680) provides: “Where distribution [of the printed matter whose distribution constitutes the offence] is prevented … by a court injunction or, in an emergency, by order of the Principal Public Prosecutor, to be confirmed by a court, … the penalty imposed shall be one-third of that laid down by law for the offence concerned.” 24.Law no. 3713 of 12 April 1991, promulgated with a view to preventing acts of terrorism, refers to a number of offences defined in the Criminal Code which it describes as “acts of terrorism” or “acts perpetrated for the purposes of terrorism” (sections 3 and 4) and to which it applies. However, the act punishable pursuant to Article 312 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 21 above) is not among them. 25.Article 318 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the holding of a public hearing in proceedings before the Court of Cassation only where the impugned judgment concerns offences classified as “serious”, such as those punishable by the death penalty or a term of imprisonment of more than ten years. The Court of Cassation’s jurisdiction, according to Article 307 of the Code, is limited to questions concerning the lawfulness and procedural regularity of the first-instance judgment. 26.The National Security Courts were created by Law no. 1773 of 11July 1973, in accordance with Article 136 of the 1961 Constitution. That Law was annulled by the Constitutional Court on 15 June 1976. The courts in question were later reintroduced into the Turkish judicial system by the 1982 Constitution. The relevant part of the statement of reasons contains the following passage: “There may be acts affecting the existence and stability of a State such that when they are committed special jurisdiction is required in order to give judgment expeditiously and appropriately. For such cases it is necessary to set up National Security Courts. According to a principle inherent in our Constitution, it is forbidden to create a special court to [give judgment on] a specific act after it has been committed. For that reason the National Security Courts have been provided for in our Constitution to try cases involving the above-mentioned offences. Given that the special provisions laying down their powers have [thus] been enacted in advance and that the courts have been created before the commission of any offence …, they may not be described as courts set up to deal with this or that offence after the commission of such an offence.” The composition and functioning of the National Security Courts are subject to the following rules. 27.The constitutional provisions governing judicial organisation are worded as follows: Article 138 §§ 1 and 2 “In the performance of their duties, judges shall be independent; they shall give judgment, according to their personal conviction, in accordance with the Constitution, statute and the law. No organ, authority, officer or other person may give orders or instructions to courts or judges in the exercise of their judicial powers, or send them circulars or make recommendations or suggestions to them.” Article 139 § 1 “Judges … shall not be removed from office or compelled to retire without their consent before the age prescribed by the Constitution…” Article 143 § 4 “Presidents, regular members and substitute judges of the National Security Courts shall be appointed for a renewable period of four years.” Article 145 § 4 “The personal rights and obligations of military judges … shall be regulated by law in accordance with the principles of the independence of the courts, the safeguards enjoyed by the judiciary and the requirements of military service. Relations between military judges and the commanders under whom they serve as regards their non-judicial duties shall also be regulated by law...” 28.Based on Article 143 of the Constitution, the relevant provisions of Law no. 2845 on the National Security Courts, provide as follows: Section 1 “In the capitals of the provinces of … National Security Courts shall be established to try persons accused of offences against the Republic – whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution – against the indivisible unity of the State – meaning both the national territory and its people – or against the free, democratic system of government and offences directly affecting the State’s internal or external security.” Section 3 “The National Security Courts shall be composed of a president and two other regular members. In addition, there shall sit at each National Security Court two substitute members.” Section 5 “The president of a National Security Court, one of the other regular members and one of the substitutes shall be civilian … judges, the other members, whether full or substitute, military judges of the first rank…” Section 6(2), (3) and (6) “The appointment of military judges to sit as regular members and substitutes shall be carried out according to the procedure laid down for that purpose in the special legislation [concerning those posts].

These were the judgments of 31 May 1988 (no. 1988/185), 14 December 1993 (no. 1993/1116), 22 December 1993 (no. 1993/1119), 19 November 1996 (no. 1996/950), 1 April 1997 (no.1997/262), 27 May 1997 (no. 1997/405) and 3 July 1997 (no. 1997/62). It appears from these judgments that in setting aside the transfer decisions concerned, the First Division gave as its grounds either lack of consent on the part of the person concerned or abuse of the military authorities’ discretionary power. In connection with assessment reports, failure to state reasons or a lack of objectivity on the part of the immediate superior was taken into account. Lastly, in connection with a disciplinary sanction, against which in principle no appeal lies, the First Division held that the acts of which the person concerned stood accused had been incorrectly established and that the sanction was accordingly null and void. 33.The Government also submitted a number of judgments rendered by National Security Courts relevant to the impartiality of military judges sitting as members of such courts. These were the judgments of 12September 1995 (no. 1995/171), 27 February 1996 (no. 1996/38), 7March 1996 (no.1996/55), 21 March 1996 (no. 1996/70), 2 April 1996 (no.1996/102), 9April 1996 (no. 1996/112), 2 May 1996 (no. 1996/141), 9May 1996 (no.1996/150), 19 August 1996 (no. 1996/250), 12 September 1996 (no.1996/258), 19 September 1996 (no. 1996/263), 1 October 1996 (no.1996/270), 3 October 1996 (no. 1996/273), 8 October 1996 (no.1996/278), 12 June 1997 (no. 1997/128) and 15 July 1997 (no.1997/393). Most of these decisions declared the accused guilty but also contained separate opinions by military judges adopting a dissenting opinion with regard to the establishment and classification of the facts, the way sentence was determined or the finding of guilt itself.",1998,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

66,001-60597,Grand Chamber,"11.At the material time the applicant was employed as a clerk in the İzmir 2nd Court of Taxation. On 18 July 1995 the İzmir Civil Court of General Jurisdiction forwarded the name and workplace of the applicant to the İzmir public prosecutor's office, stating that the applicant was suspected of having stolen and falsified court documents relating to a decided divorce case. 12.On 25 July 1995 the office of the public prosecutor referred the case to the İzmir Security Directorate. 13.At 5.10 p.m. on 25 July 1995 the applicant was taken into police custody and detained at the İzmir Security Directorate. He was accused of the above offences. The applicant gave a statement in which he denied that he had been involved in the incident relating to the court's case file. The applicant later claimed that he was not permitted to contact his family or consult a lawyer and that he was insulted and beaten for two hours. 14.Two other suspects were also detained and statements were taken from them. A statement was also taken from A.B., a party to the divorce proceedings. 15.On 27 July 1995 an investigation record was drawn up for the applicant and the two other suspects. At 5 p.m. on the same day the applicant was released pursuant to the decision of the public prosecutor. The two other suspects were kept in custody. 16.In the evening of 27 July 1995, following his release, the applicant went to the İzmir State Hospital. He was subsequently granted four days' sick leave by his employer. The medical report prepared at the hospital referred to the fact that the applicant was suffering from a common skin disease caused by the inflammation of the roots of his facial hair. 17.On 31 July 1995 the office of the public prosecutor of Karşıyaka decided not to bring charges against the applicant (takipsizlik kararı) for lack of evidence. The decision was served on the applicant on 19 August 1995. 18.The public prosecutor took a statement from the applicant on 28August 1995. In his statement the applicant declared that he had applied to the Ministry of Justice to have proceedings brought against the individual who had reported him to the authorities. 19.On 29 August 1995 the public prosecutor decided not to bring charges against the person named by the applicant. 20.On 5 September 1995 the applicant filed a complaint under Lawno.466 with the Karşıyaka Assize Court (Ağır Ceza Mahkemesi) against the Treasury requesting 200,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) by way of compensation for his detention between “24 and 27 July 1995”. In the petition, the applicant's lawyer stated, inter alia, that the applicant, while in detention, had been tortured and ill-treated by being beaten and insulted for two hours and deprived of his right to contact his family and a lawyer. As a result of his injuries, the applicant had had to take four days' sick leave. Furthermore, the applicant's reputation had suffered. He did not rely on any specific section of Law no. 466. 21.On 14 September 1995 the three-judge Karşıyaka Assize Court appointed one of its members (naip hakim) to investigate the case and draft a report. The judge designated for this purpose verified, inter alia, that the office of the public prosecutor of İzmir had dropped the charges against the applicant. He also obtained information about the applicant's personal, financial and social status. The judge found that the evidence obtained was sufficient to enable him to draft his report and decided in the exercise of his discretion under section 3 of Law no. 466 that it was unnecessary to hear the applicant. The public prosecutor was asked for his written observations on the applicant's claim. On 7 December 1995 the public prosecutor, as required by Law no. 466, submitted his opinion to the Karşıyaka Assize Court. The public prosecutor noted that the applicant was taken into custody on 25 July 1995, and not on 24 July 1995 as claimed, and was released on 27 July 1995. The public prosecutor recommended that the applicant be granted compensation for non-pecuniary damage in an amount to be assessed by the court. This opinion was not served on the applicant. 22.The judge stated in his report of 7 December 1995 to the President of the Karşıyaka Assize Court, inter alia, that the applicant had been detained for two days from 25 July to 27 July 1995 and upon his release had obtained a medical report which indicated that he had been assaulted (darp edildiği). The judge noted that the applicant had been given four days' sick leave by his employer. He further observed that, at the time when he was taken into custody, the applicant had been working in the İzmir 2nd Court of Taxation, had been paying TRL 3,000,000 in rent, was divorced and had two children. The judge concluded: “The complainant requested that he be granted the sum of TRL 200,000,000 in compensation. In determining the amount of compensation the court should consider both the complainant's economic and social position as well as the intensity of his emotional suffering. In the light of the above facts, I propose that the court grant the amount of compensation requested by the complainant.” 23.On 7 December 1995 the Karşıyaka Assize Court found that the applicant had been detained for two days and qualified for compensation. In its judgment, the court took note of all the complaints set out in the petition lodged by the applicant's lawyer as well as the content of the judge's report and the written submissions of the public prosecutor (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above). The court concluded that “... at the time he was taken into custody, the applicant had been working in the İzmir Tax Court, had been paying TRL 3,000,000 in rent, and was divorced with two children. The complainant requested that the court award him TRL 200,000,000, including interest, for the non-pecuniary damage suffered. The court considers that, in determining the amount of compensation, it should have regard both to the complainant's economic and social position as well as the intensity of his emotional suffering. In the light of the above facts and having considered the above criteria, the court concludes that the sum of TRL 10,000,000 should be awarded to the complainant”. The court also awarded the applicant TRL 1,500,000 for his legal costs. 24.The applicant's lawyer and the Treasury both appealed against the award. The applicant's lawyer contended on appeal that the amount of compensation was insufficient reparation for his wrongful arrest and detention. He did not challenge the dates of detention as determined by the court. The Treasury considered that the amount awarded was excessive. According to the relevant rules governing the functioning of the Court of Cassation in litigation of this nature, the case file at the Karşıyaka Assize Court was referred to the competent division of the Court of Cassation through the intermediary of the office of the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. On 17 October 1996 the Principal Public Prosecutor submitted his opinion on the merits of both parties' appeals. In his written opinion (tebliğname) to the Sixth Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation (Yargıtay), the Principal Public Prosecutor stated that, having regard to the first-instance proceedings, the evidence collected, the subject matter of the claim and the discretion of the first-instance court, neither of the parties had grounds for appeal. He advised that both appeals be rejected and that the first-instance judgment be approved, being in compliance with procedural rules and law. This opinion was not submitted to the applicant. 25.On 7November 1996 the Sixth Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation, having regard, inter alia, to the opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor, upheld the judgment of 7 December 1995. 26.According to information submitted by the Government, the applicant never applied to obtain the compensation awarded to him by the Karşıyaka Assize Court. 27.Article 19 of the Constitution provides: “Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with the formalities and conditions prescribed by law: ... The arrested or detained person must be brought before a judge within forty-eight hours at the latest or, in the case of offences committed by more than one person, within fifteen days ... These time-limits may be extended during a state of emergency ... ... A person deprived of his liberty, for whatever reason, shall have the right to take proceedings before a judicial authority which shall give a speedy ruling on his case and order his immediate release if it finds that the deprivation of liberty was unlawful. Compensation must be paid by the State, as the law shall provide, for damage sustained by persons who have been victims of treatment contrary to the above provisions.” 28.Under Article 128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, an arrested person must be brought before a judge within twenty-four hours or, where the offence has been committed by more than one person, within four days. 29.Section 1 of Law no. 466 on the payment of compensation to persons arrested or detained provides: “Compensation shall be paid by the State in respect of all damage sustained by persons: (1)who have been arrested or detained under conditions or in circumstances incompatible with the Constitution or statute law; (2)who have not been immediately informed of the reasons for their arrest or detention; (3)who have not been brought before a judicial officer after being arrested or detained within the time-limit laid down by statute for that purpose; (4)who have been deprived of their liberty without a court order after the statutory time-limit for being brought before a judicial officer has expired; (5)whose close family have not been immediately informed of their arrest or detention; (6)who, after being arrested or detained in accordance with the law, are not subsequently committed for trial..., or are acquitted or discharged after standing trial; or (7)who have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment shorter than the period spent in detention or ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty only.” 30.By virtue of section 2 of Law no. 466, a claimant must apply for compensation to the local assize court within three months, setting out the facts complained of and indicating the amount claimed. The claim is lodged against the Treasury. 31.According to section 3 of the same Law: “The competent court ... shall appoint one of its members upon the submission of the petition for compensation. The appointed member shall first examine whether the request was lodged within the statutory time-limit. Where the appointed member finds that the request was lodged within the statutory time-limit he shall collect all evidence including the case file and the judgment [concerning the criminal proceedings]. If necessary, he shall take oral evidence from the claimant. The appointed member shall transfer the case file to the office of the public prosecutor for his opinion after collecting all the evidence. Upon the receipt of the public prosecutor's written opinion, the court shall give its decision without holding a hearing. The petitioner has the right to lodge an appeal against the court's decision within one week after he is notified of this decision.” 32.A claimant is entitled to seek compensation for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage arising from unlawful detention. A pecuniary claim must be documented. Non-pecuniary damage is awarded on the basis of the claimant's personal, financial and social status. 33.The relevant parts of Article 438 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide: “The Court of Cassation shall examine the appeal without holding a hearing. The Court of Cassation shall notify the parties of the date of the oral hearing, if either of the parties requested a hearing in their petitions, in the following cases: ... –in actions in which the amount requested is more than 200,000,000 Turkish liras. ...” 34.In the Turkish legal system, when a judgment of a first-instance court is appealed, the case file is first sent to the Office of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. The Principal Public Prosecutor, who is independent of the executive and of the parties, submits an opinion (tebliğname) on the case to the competent division of the Court of Cassation. The submission of the opinion by the Principal Public Prosecutor is regulated by Article 28 § 2 of the Code of the Court of Cassation no. 2797. According to the Government, the opinion is prepared by the assistants of the Principal Public Prosecutor and is included in a short document which indicates that the file has been seen by the first-instance court and advises whether the latter's judgment should be quashed or upheld. The opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor is not binding on the division of the Court of Cassation which will consider the appeal.",2002,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

158,001-78135,Grand Chamber,"8.The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in .>On 22 May 1998 the Häme Tax Office (verotoimisto, skattebyrån) requested the applicant, who ran a car-repair workshop, to submit his observations regarding some alleged errors in his value-added tax (VAT) declarations (arvonlisävero, mervärdesskatt) for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. 10.On 9 July 1998 the Tax Office found that there were deficiencies in the applicant’s book-keeping in that, for instance, receipts and invoices were inadequate. The Tax Office made a reassessment of the VAT payable basing itself on the applicant’s estimated income, which was higher than the income he had declared. It ordered him to pay, inter alia, tax surcharges (veronkorotus, skatteförhöjning) amounting to 10% of the reassessed tax liability (the additional tax surcharges levied on the applicant totalled 1,836Finnish Marks, corresponding to 308.80 euros). 11.The applicant appealed to the (lääninoikeus, länsrätten) (which later became the (hallinto-oikeus, förvaltningsdomstolen)). He requested an oral hearing and that the tax inspector as well as an expert appointed by the applicant be heard as witnesses. On 1 February 2000 the took an interim decision inviting written observations from the tax inspector and after that an expert statement from an expert chosen by the applicant. The tax inspector submitted her statement of 13 February 2000 to the . The statement was further submitted to the applicant for his observations. On 25 April 2000 the applicant submitted his own observations on the tax inspector’s statement. The statement of the expert chosen by him was dated and submitted to the court on the same day. 12.On 13 June 2000 the held that an oral hearing was manifestly unnecessary in the matter because both parties had submitted all the necessary information in writing. It also rejected the applicant’s claims. 13.On 7 August 2000 the applicant requested leave to appeal, renewing at the same time his request for an oral hearing. On 13 March 2001 the refused him leave to appeal. 14.Section 177(1) of the Value-Added Tax Act (arvonlisäverolaki, mervärdesskattelagen; Law no. 1501/1993) provides that if a person liable to pay taxes has failed to pay the taxes or clearly paid an insufficient amount of taxes or failed to give required information to the tax authorities, the Regional Tax Office (verovirasto, skatteverket) must assess the amount of unpaid taxes. 15.Section 179 provides that a tax assessment may be conducted where a person has failed to make the required declarations or has given false information to the tax authorities. The taxpayer may be ordered to pay unpaid taxes or taxes that have been wrongly refunded to the person. 16.Section 182 provides, inter alia, that a maximum tax surcharge of 20% of the tax liability may be imposed if the person has without a justifiable reason failed to give a tax declaration or other document in due time or given essentially incomplete information. The tax surcharge may amount at most to twice the amount of the tax liability, if the person has without any justifiable reason failed to fulfil his or her duties fully or partially even after being expressly asked to provide information. 17.In, for example, the Finnish judicial reference book, Encyclopædia Iuridica Fennica, a tax surcharge is defined as an administrative sanction of a punitive nature imposed on the taxpayer for conduct contrary to tax law. 18.Under Finnish practice, the imposition of a tax surcharge does not prevent the bringing of criminal charges for the same conduct. 19.Section 38(1) of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act (hallintolainkäyttölaki, förvaltningsprocesslagen; Law no. 586/1996) provides that an oral hearing must be held if requested by a private party. An oral hearing may however be dispensed with if a party’s request is ruled inadmissible or immediately dismissed, or if an oral hearing would be clearly unnecessary owing to the nature of the case or other circumstances. 20.The explanatory part of the Government Bill (no. 217/1995) for the enactment of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act considers the right to an oral hearing as provided by Article 6 and the possibility in administrative matters to dispense with the hearing when it would be clearly unnecessary, as stated in section 38(1) of the said Act. There it is noted that an oral hearing contributes to a focused and immediate procedure but, since it does not always bring any added value, it must be ensured that the flexibility and cost effectiveness of the administrative procedure is not undermined. An oral hearing is to be held when it is necessary for the clarification of the issues and the hearing can be considered beneficial for the case as a whole. 21.During the period 2000 to 2006, the did not hold any oral hearings in tax matters. As to the eight administrative courts, appellants requested an oral hearing in a total of 603 cases. The courts held an oral hearing in 129 cases. There is no information as to how many of these taxation cases concerned the imposition of a tax surcharge. According to the Government’s written submission of 12 July 2006, the administrative courts had thus far in 2006 held a total of 20 oral hearings in tax matters. As regards the in particular, in 2005 it examined a total of 10,669 cases of which 4,232 were tax matters. Out of the last-mentioned group of cases, 505 concerned VAT.

25,001-144276,Grand Chamber,"12.The applicant was born in 1961 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Lepoglava State Prison. 13.On 19 December 1991 the Osijek Police Department lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant and five other persons with the Osijek County Court, alleging that the applicant, a member of the Croatian army, had killed several civilians. 14.On 20 April 1993 the Osijek Military Prosecutor indicted the applicant before the Osijek County Court on charges of murder, inflicting grievous bodily harm, causing a risk to life and assets, and theft. The relevant part of the indictment reads: “The first accused, Fred Marguš>On 20 November 1991 at about 7 a.m. in Čepin ... fired four times at S.B. with an automatic gun ... as a result of which S.B. died; ...>At the same time and place as under (1) ... fired several times at V.B. with an automatic gun ... as a result of which V.B. died; ...>On 10 December 1991 took N.V. to the ‘Vrbik’ forest between Čepin and Ivanovac ... and fired at him twice with an automatic gun ... as a result of which N.V. died; ...>At the same place and time as under (3) fired at Ne.V. with an automatic gun ... as a result of which she died; ...>On 28 August 1991 at about 3 a.m. threw an explosive device into business premises in Čepinski Martinovec ... causing material damage; ...>On 18 November 1991 at 00.35 a.m. in Čepin placed an explosive device in a house ... causing material damage ...; ...>On 1 August 1991 at 3.30 p.m. in Čepin ... fired at R.C., causing him slight bodily injury and then ... kicked V.Ž ... causing him grievous bodily injury ... and also kicked R.C. ... causing him further slight bodily injuries ...; ...>Between 26 September and 5 October 1991 in Čepin ... stole several guns and bullets ...; ...” He was further charged with appropriating several tractors and other machines belonging to other persons. 15.On 25 January 1996 the Osijek Deputy Military Prosecutor dropped the charges under counts 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9 of the indictment as well as the charges of appropriating goods belonging to others. A new count was added, by which the applicant was charged with having fired, on 20November 1991 at about 7 a.m. in Čepin, at a child, Sl.B., causing him grievous bodily injury. The former count 8 of the indictment thus became count 4. 16.On 24 September 1996 the General Amnesty Act was enacted. It stipulated that a general amnesty was to be applied in respect of all criminal offences committed in connection with the war in Croatia between 17August 1990 and 23 August 1996, save in respect of those acts which amounted to the gravest breaches of humanitarian law or to war crimes, including the crime of genocide (see paragraph 27 below). 17.On 24 June 1997 the Osijek County Court, sitting as a panel presided over by Judge M.K., terminated the proceedings pursuant to the General Amnesty Act. The relevant part of this ruling reads: “The Osijek County Court ... on 24 June 1997 has decided as follows: the criminal proceedings against the accused Fred Marguš on two charges of murder ... inflicting grievous bodily harm ... and causing a risk to life and assets ... instituted on the indictment lodged by the Osijek County State Attorney’s Office ... on 10 February 1997 are to be concluded under section 1(1) and (3) and section 2(2) of the General Amnesty Act. ... The indictment of the Osijek Military State Attorney’s Office no. Kt-1/93 of 20April 1993 charged Fred Marguš with three offences of aggravated murder under Article 35 § 1 of the Criminal Code; one offence of aggravated murder under Article35 § 2(2) of the Criminal Code; two criminal offences of causing a risk to life and assets ... under Article 153 § 1 of the Criminal Code; one criminal offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm under Article 41 § 1 of the Criminal Code; one criminal offence of theft of weapons or other fighting equipment under Article 223 §§1 and 2 of the Criminal Code; and one criminal offence of aggravated theft under Article 131 § 2 of the Criminal Code ... The above indictment was significantly altered at a hearing held on 25 January 1996 before the Osijek Military Court, when the Deputy Military Prosecutor withdrew some of the charges and altered the factual and legal description and the legal classification of some of the offences. Thus, the accused Fred Marguš was indicted for two offences of murder under Article 34 § 1 of the Criminal Code, one criminal offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm under Article 41 § 1 of the Criminal Code and one criminal offence of causing a risk to life and assets ... under Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code ... After the military courts had been abolished, the case file was forwarded to the Osijek County State Attorney’s Office, which took over the prosecution on the same charges and asked that the proceedings be continued before the Osijek County Court. The latter forwarded the case file to a three-judge panel in the context of application of the General Amnesty Act. After considering the case file, this panel has concluded that the conditions under section 1(1) and (3) and section 2(2) of the General Amnesty Act have been met and that the accused is not excluded from amnesty. The above-mentioned Act provides for a general amnesty in respect of criminal offences committed during the aggression, armed rebellion or armed conflicts .... in the Republic of Croatia. The general amnesty concerns criminal offences committed between 17 August 1990 and 23 August 1996. The general amnesty excludes only the perpetrators of the gravest breaches of humanitarian law which amount to war crimes, and certain criminal offences listed in section 3 of the General Amnesty Act. It also excludes the perpetrators of other criminal offences under the Criminal Code ... which were not committed during the aggression, armed rebellion or armed conflicts and which are not connected with the aggression, armed rebellion or armed conflicts in Croatia. The accused, Fred Marguš, is indicted for three criminal offences committed in Čepin on 20 November 1991 and one criminal offence committed in Čepin on 1August 1991. The first three of these offences concern the most difficult period and the time of the most serious attacks on Osijek and Eastern Croatia immediately after the fall of Vukovar, and the time of the most severe battles for Laslovo. In those battles, the accused distinguished himself as a combatant, showing exceptional courage and being recommended for promotion to the rank of lieutenant by the commander of the Third Battalion of the 106th Brigade of the Croatian army, who was his superior officer at that time. In the critical period concerning the first three criminal offences, the accused was acting in his capacity as a member of the Croatian army; in that most difficult period, acting as commander of a unit, he tried to prevent the fall of a settlement into enemy hands, when there was an immediate danger of this happening. The fourth criminal offence was committed on 1 August 1991, when the accused was acting in his capacity as an on-duty member of the Reserve Forces in Čepin and was dressed in military camouflage uniform and using military weapons. ... The actions of the accused, in view of the time and place of the events in issue, were closely connected with the aggression, armed rebellion and armed conflicts in Croatia, and were carried out during the period referred to in the General Amnesty Act. ... Against this background, this court finds that all the statutory conditions for application of the General Amnesty Act have been met ...” 18.On an unspecified date the State Attorney lodged a request for the protection of legality (zahtjev za zaštitu zakonitosti) with the Supreme Court, asking it to establish that section 3(2) of the General Amnesty Act had been violated. 19.On 19 September 2007 the Supreme Court, when deciding upon the above request, established that the above ruling of the Osijek County Court of 24 June 1997 violated section 3(2) of the General Amnesty Act. The relevant parts of the Supreme Court’s ruling read: “... Section 1(1) of the General Amnesty Act provides for a general amnesty from criminal prosecution and trial for the perpetrators of criminal offences committed in connection with the aggression, armed rebellion or armed conflicts ... in Croatia. Under paragraph 3 of the same section the amnesty concerns criminal offences committed between 17 August 1990 and 23 August 1996. ... For the correct interpretation of these provisions – apart from the general condition that the criminal offence in question had to have been committed in the period between 17 August 1990 and 23 August 1996 (which has been met in the present case) – there must exist a direct and significant connection between the criminal offence and the aggression, armed rebellion or armed conflicts. This interpretation is in accordance with the general principle that anyone who commits a criminal offence has to answer for it. Therefore, the above provisions have to be interpreted in a sensible manner, with the necessary caution, so that the amnesty does not become a contradiction of itself and call into question the purpose for which the Act in question was enacted. Hence, the expression ‘in connection with the aggression, armed rebellion or armed conflicts’ used in the General Amnesty Act, which does not specifically define the nature of that connection, has to be interpreted to mean that the connection must be direct and significant. ... Part of the factual description of the criminal offences with which the accused Fred Marguš is charged ... which suggests some connection with the aggression against the Republic of Croatia or armed rebellion and armed conflicts in Croatia, relates to the arrival of the victims of these offences – S.B., V.B. and the minor Sl.B. – in Čepin, together with their neighbours, after they had all fled the village of Ivanovac on account of the attack by the so-called ‘Y[ugoslav] P[eoples’] A[rmy]’. It should be stressed that it is not in dispute that the accused Fred Marguš was a member of the Croatian army. However, these circumstances are not such as to amount to a direct link with the aggression, armed rebellion or armed conflicts in Croatia which is required for the General Amnesty Act to apply. The factual description of the criminal offences under count 4 of the indictment states that the accused committed these acts as a member of the Reserve Forces in Čepin, after his tour of duty had terminated. This characteristic in itself does not represent a significant link between the criminal offences and the war because, were this to be the case, the amnesty would encompass all criminal offences committed between 27 August 1990 and 23 August 1996 by members of the Croatian army or the enemy units (save for those specifically listed in section 3(1) of the General Amnesty Act); this was certainly not the intention of the legislature. Finally, the accused’s war career, described in detail in the impugned ruling, cannot be a criterion for application of the General Amnesty Act ... The factual description of the criminal offences in the indictment ... does not show that the acts in question were committed during the aggression, armed rebellion or armed conflicts in Croatia, or that they were committed in connection with them. ...” 20.On 26 April 2006 the Osijek County State Attorney’s Office indicted the applicant on charges of war crimes against the civilian population. The proceedings were conducted by a three-judge panel of the Osijek County Court, including Judge M.K. During the entire proceedings the applicant was represented by a lawyer. 21.A concluding hearing was held on 19 March 2007 in the presence of, inter alia, the applicant and his defence lawyer. The applicant was removed from the courtroom during the closing arguments of the parties. The applicant’s lawyer remained in the courtroom and presented his closing arguments. The relevant part of the written record of that hearing reads as follows: “The President of the panel notes that the accused Marguš interrupted the Osijek County Deputy State Attorney (‘the Deputy State Attorney’) in his closing arguments and was warned by the panel to calm down; the second time he interrupted the Deputy State Attorney he was warned orally. After the President of the panel warned the accused Marguš orally, the latter continued to comment on the closing arguments of the Deputy State Attorney. The panel therefore decides, and the president of the panel orders, that the accused Marguš be removed from the courtroom until the pronouncement of the judgment. ...” 22.The applicant was subsequently removed from the courtroom and the Deputy State Attorney, the lawyers for the victims, the defence lawyers and one of the accused gave their closing arguments. 23.The pronouncement of the judgment was scheduled for 21March 2007 and the hearing was concluded. The applicant was present at the pronouncement of the judgment. He was found guilty as charged and sentenced to fourteen years’ imprisonment. The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows: “... The accused Fred Marguš ... and the accused T.D. ... are guilty [in that] in the period between 20 and 25 November 1991 in Čepin and its surroundings, contrary to Article 3 § 1 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 and Article 4 §§ 1 and 2(a) and Article 13 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II) of 8 June 1977, while defending that territory from armed attacks by the local rebel Serb population and the so-called Yugoslav People’s Army in their joint attack on the constitutional legal order and territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia, Fred Marguš, in his capacity as the commander of Unit 2 in the 3rd Corps of the 130th brigade of the Croatian army, and the accused T.D., as a member of the same Unit under the command of Fred Marguš, [acted as follows] with the intention of killing Serb civilians; the accused Fred Marguš (a) on 20 November 1991 at about 8 a.m. in Čepin, recognised V.B. and S.B. who were standing ... in front of the Fire Brigade Headquarters in Ivanovac and were fleeing their village because of the attacks by the Yugoslav People’s Army, ... fired at them with an automatic gun ... which caused S.B. to sustain a gunshot wound to the head ... and neck as a result of which S.B. immediately died, while V.B. was wounded and fell to the ground. The accused then drove away and soon afterwards came back, and, seeing that V.B. was still alive and accompanied by his nine-year-old son Sl.B. and ... his wife M.B., again fired the automatic gun at them, and thus shot V.B. twice in the head ... twice in the arm ... as a result of which V.B. soon died while Sl.B. was shot in the leg ... which amounted to grievous bodily harm; (b) in the period between 22 and 24 November 1991 in Čepin, arrested N.V. and Ne.V., threatening them with firearms, appropriated their Golf vehicle ... took them to the basement of a house ... where he tied them by ropes to chairs and kept them locked in without food or water and, together with the members of his Unit ... beat and insulted them, asked them about their alleged hostile activity and possession of a radio set, and during that time prevented other members of the Unit from helping them ... after which he took them out of Čepin to a forest ... where they were shot with several bullets from firearms ... as a result of which N.V. ... and Ne.V. died; (c) on 23 November 1991 at about 1.30 p.m. at the coach terminal in Čepin, arrested S.G. and D.G. and their relative Lj.G. and drove them to a house ... tied their hands behind their backs and, together with the late T.B., interrogated them about their alleged hostile activity and in the evening, while they were still tied up, drove them out of Čepin ... where he shot them ... as a result of which they died; the accused Fred Marguš and T.D. [acting] together (d) on 25 November 1991 at about 1 p.m. in Čepin, on seeing S.P. driving his Golf vehicle ... stopped him at the request of Fred Marguš ... ... and drove him to a field ... where ... Fred Marguš ordered T.D. to shoot S.P., [an order] which T.D. obeyed, shooting S.P. once ... after which Fred Marguš shot him several times with an automatic gun ... as a result of which S.P. ... died and Fred Marguš appropriated his vehicle. ...” 24.The applicant’s conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court on 19September 2007 and his sentence was increased to fifteen years’ imprisonment. The relevant part of the judgment by the Supreme Court reads as follows: “Under Article 36 § 1(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP), a judge is exempted from performing judicial functions if he or she participated in the same case in the adoption of a ruling of a lower court or if he participated in adopting the impugned ruling. It is true that Judge M.K. participated in the proceedings in which the impugned judgment was adopted. He was the President of a panel of the Osijek County Court which adopted the ruling ... of 24 June 1997 by which the proceedings against the accused Fred Marguš were terminated under section 1(1) and (3) and section 2(2) of the General Amnesty Act ... Even though both sets of proceedings were instituted against the same accused, it was not the same case. The judge in question participated in two different cases before the Osijek County Court against the same accused. In the case in which the present appeal has been lodged, Judge M.K. did not participate in adopting any decision of a lower court or in a decision which is the subject of an appeal or an extraordinary remedy. ... The accused incorrectly argued that the first-instance court had acted contrary to Article 346 § 4 and Article 347 §§ 1 and 4 of the CCP when it held the concluding hearing in his absence and in the absence of his defence lawyer because it had removed him from the courtroom when the parties were presenting their closing arguments. Thus, he claimed, he had been prevented from giving his closing arguments. Furthermore, he had not been informed about the conduct of the hearing in his absence, and the decision to remove him from the courtroom had not been adopted by the trial panel. Contrary to the allegations of the accused, the written record of the hearing held on 19 March 2007 shows that the accused Fred Marguš interrupted the [Osijek] County Deputy State Attorney in his closing arguments and was twice warned by the President of the trial panel. Since he continued with the same behaviour, the trial panel decided to remove him from the courtroom ... Such action by the trial court is in conformity with Article 300 § 2 of the CCP. The accused Fred Marguš started to disturb order in the courtroom during the closing arguments of the [Osijek County Deputy] State Attorney and persisted in doing so, after which he was removed from the courtroom by a decision of the trial panel. He was again present in the courtroom when judgment was pronounced on 21 March 2007. Since the trial court complied fully with Article 300 § 2 of the CCP, the accused’s appeal is unfounded. In the case in issue there has been no violation of the defence rights, and the removal of the accused from the courtroom during the closing arguments of the parties had no effect on the judgment. ... The accused Fred Marguš further argues ... that the impugned judgment violated the ne bis in idem principle ... because the proceedings had already been discontinued in respect of some of the charges giving rise to the impugned judgment ... ... It is true that criminal proceedings were conducted before the Osijek County Court under the number K-4/97 against the accused Fred Marguš in respect of, inter alia, four criminal offences ... of murder ... committed against S.B., V.B., N.V. and Ne.V, as well as the criminal offence ... of creating a risk to life and assets ... These proceedings were terminated by final ruling of the Osijek County Court no.Kv-99/97 (K-4/97) of 24 June 1997 on the basis of the General Amnesty Act ... Despite the fact that the consequences of the criminal offences which were the subject of the proceedings conducted before the Osijek County Court under the numberK-4/97, namely the deaths of S.B., V.B., N.V. and Ne.V. and the grievous bodily injury of Sl.B., are also part of the factual background [to the criminal offences assessed] in the proceedings in which the impugned judgment has been adopted, the offences [tried in the two sets of criminal proceedings in issue] are not the same. Comparison between the factual background [to the criminal offences assessed] in both sets of proceedings shows that they are not identical. The factual background [to the offences referred to] in the impugned judgment contains a further criminal element, significantly wider in scope than the one forming the basis for the proceedings conducted before the Osijek County Court under the number K-4/97. [In the present case] the accused Fred Marguš is charged with violation of the rules of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 and of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12August 1949 relative to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II) of 8 June 1977, in that, in the period between 20 and 25November 1991, while defending that territory from armed attacks by the local rebel Serb population and the so-called Yugoslav People’s Army in their joint attack on the constitutional legal order and territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia, and in violation of the rules of international law, he killed and tortured civilians, treated them in an inhuman manner, unlawfully arrested them, ordered the killing of a civilian and robbed the assets of the civilian population. The above acts constitute a criminal offence against the values protected by international law, namely a war crime against the civilian population under Article 120 § 1 of the Criminal Code. Since the factual background to the criminal offence in issue, and its legal classification, differ from those which were the subject of the earlier proceedings, such that the scope of the charges against the accused Fred Marguš is significantly wider and different from the previous case (case-file no. K-4/97), the matter is not res judicata ...” 25.A subsequent constitutional complaint by the applicant was dismissed by the Constitutional Court on 30 September 2009. The Constitutional Court endorsed the views of the Supreme Court. 26.The relevant part of the Croatian Constitution (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 41/2001 and 55/2001) reads as follows: 27.The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Zakon o kaznenom postupku – Official Gazette nos. 110/1997, 27/1998, 58/1999, 112/1999, 58/2002, 62/2003, 178/2004 and 115/2006) provide as follows: “1.Where the accused ... disturbs order at a hearing or does not comply with the orders of the presiding judge, the latter shall warn the accused ... The panel may order that the accused be removed from the courtroom ...>The panel may order that the accused be removed from the courtroom for a limited time. Where the accused again disturbs order [he or she may be removed from the courtroom] until the end of the presentation of evidence. Before the closure of the presentation of evidence the presiding judge shall summon the accused and inform him about the conduct of the trial. If the accused continues to disturb order and insults the dignity of the court, the panel may again order that he be removed from the courtroom. In that case the trial shall be concluded in the accused’s absence and the presiding judge or another member of the panel shall inform him or her about the judgment adopted, in the presence of a typist. ...” “1.A judgment may refer only to the accused and the offence which are the subject of the indictment as initially submitted or as altered at the hearing.>The court is not bound by the prosecutor’s legal classification of the offence.” “1.A judgment shall dismiss the charges, acquit the accused or find him or her guilty. ...” “A judgment acquitting the accused shall be adopted when: (1)the offence with which the accused is charged is not a criminal offence under the law; (2)there are circumstances that exclude the accused’s guilt; (3)it has not been proved that the accused committed the criminal offence with which he or she is charged.” “1.A judgment finding the accused guilty shall contain the following details: (1)the offence of which the accused is found guilty, stating the facts and circumstances constituting the specific ingredients of a given criminal offence as well as those on which the application of a specific provision of the Criminal Code depends; (2)the statutory name and description of the criminal offence and the provisions of the Criminal Code which have been applied; (3)the sentence to be applied or whether, under the provisions of the Criminal Code, a sentence is not to be applied or imprisonment is to be substituted by community service; (4)any decision on suspended sentence; (5)any decision on security measures and confiscation of material gains; ... (7)the decision on costs and on any civil claim and whether a final judgment is to be published in the media. ...” “1.A grave breach of criminal procedure shall be found to exist where ... (3)a hearing has been held without a person whose presence is obligatory under the law ... ...” “Criminal proceedings concluded by a final ruling or a final judgment may be reopened at the request of an authorised person, only in the circumstances and under the conditions set out in this Code.” “1.Criminal proceedings concluded by a final judgment dismissing the charges may exceptionally be reopened to the detriment of the accused: ... (5)where it has been established that amnesty, pardon, statutory limitation or other circumstances excluding criminal prosecution are not applicable to the criminal offence referred to in the judgment dismissing the charges. ...” “1.The court competent to decide upon a request for the reopening of the proceedings is the one which adjudicated the case at first instance ...>The request for reopening shall contain the statutory basis for reopening and evidence supporting the request ... ...” “1.The State Attorney may lodge a request for the protection of legality against final judicial decisions and court proceedings preceding such decisions in which a law has been violated.>The State Attorney shall lodge a request for the protection of legality against a judicial decision adopted in proceedings in which fundamental human rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, statute or international law have been violated. ...” “1.The Supreme Court of the Republic of Croatia shall determine requests for the protection of legality. ...” “1.When determining a request for the protection of legality the [Supreme] Court shall assess only those violations of the law relied on by the State Attorney. ...” “...>Where a request for the protection of legality has been lodged to the detriment of the accused and the [Supreme] Court establishes that it is well founded, it shall merely establish that there has been a violation of the law, without altering a final decision.” 28.Under the Criminal Code (Kazeni zakon, Offcial Gazette nos.53/1991, 39/1992 and 91/1992) the circumstances excluding an individual’s guilt are lack of accountability (neubrojivost), error in law or error in fact. 29.The relevant part of the General Amnesty Act of 24 September 1996 (Official Gazette no. 80/1996, Zakon o općem oprostu) reads as follows: “This Act grants general amnesty from criminal prosecution and trial to the perpetrators of criminal offences committed during the aggression, armed rebellion or armed conflicts and in connection with the aggression, armed rebellion or armed conflicts in the Republic of Croatia. No amnesty shall apply to the execution of final judgments in respect of perpetrators of the criminal offences under paragraph 1 of this section. Amnesty from criminal prosecution and trial shall apply to offences committed between 17 August 1990 and 23 August 1996.” “No criminal prosecution or trial proceedings shall be instituted against the perpetrators of the criminal offences under section 1 of this Act. Where a criminal prosecution has already commenced it shall be discontinued and where trial proceedings have been instituted a court shall issue a ruling terminating the proceedings of its own motion. Where a person granted amnesty under paragraph 1 of this section has been detained, he or she shall be released.” “No amnesty under section 1 of this Act shall be granted to perpetrators of the gravest breaches of humanitarian law which have the character of war crimes, namely the criminal offence of genocide under Article 119 of the Basic Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia (Official Gazette no. 31/1993, consolidated text, nos. 35/1993, 108/1995, 16/1996 and 28/1996); war crimes against the civilian population under Article 120; war crimes against the wounded and sick under Article 121; war crimes against prisoners of war under Article 122; organising groups [with the purpose of committing] or aiding and abetting genocide and war crimes under Article 123; unlawful killing and wounding of the enemy under Article 124; unlawful taking of possessions from the dead or wounded on the battleground under Article 125; use of unlawful means of combat under Article 126; offences against negotiators under Article 127; cruel treatment of the wounded, sick and prisoners of war under Article128; unjustified delay in repatriation of prisoners of war under Article 129; destruction of the cultural and historical heritage under Article 130; inciting war of aggression under Article 131; abuse of international symbols under Article 132; racial and other discrimination under Article 133; establishing slavery and transferring slaves under Article 134; international terrorism under Article 135; putting at risk persons under international protection under Article 136; taking hostages under Article 137; and the criminal offence of terrorism under the provisions of international law. No amnesty shall be granted to perpetrators of other criminal offences under the Basic Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia (Official Gazette no. 31/1993, consolidated text, nos. 35/1993, 108/1995, 16/1996 and 28/1996) and the Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia (Official Gazette no. 32/1993, consolidated text, nos.38/1993, 28/1996 and 30/1996) which were not committed during the aggression, armed rebellion or armed conflicts and are not connected with the aggression, armed rebellion or armed conflicts in the Republic of Croatia. ...” “A State Attorney may not lodge an appeal against a court decision under section 2 of this Act where the court granted amnesty in favour of the perpetrator of a criminal offence covered by this Act on the basis of the legal classification given to the offence by a State Attorney.” 30.In its decision no. U-III/543/1999 of 26 November 2008 the Constitutional Court held, in so far as relevant, as follows: “6.The question before the Constitutional Court is whether there was a second trial concerning an event constituting the offence for which the General Amnesty Act was applied, and thus whether the proceedings concerned a ‘same offence’ in respect of which, under Article 31 § 2 of the Constitution, it is not possible to institute a new, separate and unrelated set of proceedings. Such proceedings would infringe [the principle of] legal certainty and permit multiple sanctions to be imposed for one and the same conduct which may be the subject of only one criminal sanction. In answering this question, the Constitutional Court should examine two issues: (a) the similarity between the descriptions of the events constituting the offences with which the appellant was charged in the first and second set of proceedings, in order to verify whether the decision on the application of amnesty and the final conviction in the subsequent proceedings concern the same subject, that is, the same ‘criminal quantity’, irrespective of whether they concern the same historical events; and after that ... (b) whether the case in issue concerns a situation in which it was not possible to bring fresh charges in relation to the facts already adjudicated in the first decisions of the courts (applying the amnesty), but in which, under Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution, it was possible to seek the reopening of the proceedings as provided for by the relevant law. Article 406 § 1 (5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows for the reopening of proceedings which were terminated by a final judgment dismissing the charges, where ‘it has been established that amnesty, pardon, statutory limitation or other circumstances excluding criminal prosecution are not applicable to the criminal offence referred to in the judgment dismissing the charges’.>1.The Constitutional Court can examine the similarity between the descriptions of the events constituting the offences only by reference to the normative standards. In so doing it is bound, just like the lower courts, by the constituent elements of the offences, irrespective of their legal classification. The descriptions of the events forming the basis for the charges in the judgment of the Bjelovar Military Court (no.K-85/95-24) and the Supreme Court (no. IKž-257/96), and the impugned judgments of the Sisak County Court (no. K-108/97) and the Supreme Court (no. I Kž-211/1998-3), undoubtedly suggest that they concern the same events, which were merely given different legal classifications. All the relevant facts had been established by the Bjelovar Military Court (which finally terminated the proceedings) and no other new facts were established in the subsequent proceedings before the Sisak County Court. The only difference in the description of the charges was in the time of the commission of the offences, which does not suggest that the events were different but rather that the courts were unable to establish the exact time of the offences. As regards the identical nature of the events, it is also relevant to note that the Supreme Court emphasised in the impugned judgment that the events were the same, so there is no doubt about this aspect.>2.In the impugned judgment the Supreme Court held that the conduct in issue constituted not only the offence of armed rebellion under Article 235 § 1 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia, in respect of which the judgment dismissing the charges was adopted, but also the offence of war crimes against the civilian population under Article 120 §§ 1 and 2 of the Basic Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia, the offence of which [the appellant] was later convicted. It follows from this reasoning of the Supreme Court that the same conduct constituted the elements of two offences and that the situation was one of a single act constituting various offences.>3.The Constitutional Court finds that in the impugned judgment the Supreme Court erred in finding that the same perpetrator, after a final judgment had been adopted in respect of a single act constituting one offence, could be tried again in the new set of proceedings for the same act constituting another offence. Under Article 336 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the court is not bound by the prosecutor’s classification of the offence. The Bjelovar Military Court, if it considered that the facts underlying the charges constituted the offence of war crimes against the civilian population under Article 120 § 1 of the Basic Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia, should therefore have found that it had no competence to determine the case (because it had no competence to try war crimes), and should have forwarded the case to the competent court, which could have convicted [the appellant] of the offence of war crimes against the civilian population, in respect of which no amnesty could be applied. Since the Bjelovar Military Court did not act in such a manner, it follows that, owing to the final nature of its judgment, the decision dismissing the charges became res judicata. The subsequent conviction in this case is a violation of the ne bis in idem rule, irrespective of the fact that the operative part of the first judgment did not concern ‘the merits’, sometimes understood simply as a resolution of the question whether the accused committed the offence or not. The formal distinction between an acquittal and a judgment dismissing the charges cannot be the only criterion for the resolution of the question whether a new and unrelated set of criminal proceedings may be instituted in respect of the same ‘criminal quantity’: although it is contained in the judgment dismissing the charges, the decision on the application of amnesty, in the legal sense, creates the same legal consequences as an acquittal, and in both judgments a factual issue remains unproven.>4.Therefore the Constitutional Court cannot accept the reasoning of the Supreme Court’s judgment no. I Kž-211/1998-3 of 1 April 1999, according to which the judgment or ruling on the discontinuance of the proceedings for the offence of armed rebellion concerning the same event does not exclude the possibility of a subsequent prosecution and conviction for the offence of war crimes against the civilian population on the ground that the latter offence endangers not only the values of the Republic of Croatia but also humanity in general and international law. In any event, the Supreme Court later departed from that position in case no. I Kž-8/00-3 of 18September 2002, finding that the judgment dismissing the charges ‘without any doubt concerns the same event, in terms of the time, place and manner of commission; the event was simply given a different classification in the impugned judgment than in the ruling of the Zagreb Military Court’. It also stated the following: ‘When, as in the case in issue, the criminal proceedings have been discontinued in respect of the offence under Article 244 § 2 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia, and where the actions ... are identical to those of which [the accused] was found guilty in the impugned judgment ... under the ne bis in idem principle provided for in Article32 § 2 of the Constitution, new criminal proceedings cannot be instituted because the matter has been adjudicated.’ ...” 31.Constitutional Court decision no. U-III-791/1997 of 14 March 2001 referred to a situation where the criminal proceedings against the accused had been terminated under the General Amnesty Act. Its relevant parts read as follows: “16.The provision of the Constitution which excludes the possibility of an accused being tried again for an offence of which he or she has already been ‘finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law’ refers exclusively to a situation where a judgment has been adopted in criminal proceedings which acquits the accused or finds him or her guilty of the charges brought against him or her in the indictment. ... 19.... a ruling which does not finally acquit the accused but terminates the criminal proceedings cannot form the basis for application of the constitutional provisions concerning the prohibition on being tried or punished again ...” 32.The relevant part of ruling no. I Kž-533/00-3 of 11 December 2001 reads as follows: “Under Article 336 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the court is not bound by the prosecutor’s legal classification of the offence, and it was therefore empowered to decide upon a different criminal offence since that offence is more favourable [to the accused] ...” 33.The relevant part of ruling no. I Kž 257/02-5 of 12 October 2005 reads as follows: “Since under Article 336 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the court is not bound by the prosecutor’s legal classification of the offence, and given that the possible sentence for the criminal offence of incitement to abuse of authority in financial affairs under Article 292 § 2 is more lenient than the possible sentence for the criminal offence under Article 337 § 4 of the Criminal Code, the first-instance court was empowered to classify the acts in question as the criminal offence under Article 292 § 2 of the Criminal Code ...” 34.The relevant part of ruling no. I Kž 657/10-3 of 27 October 2010 reads as follows: “Even though the first-instance court correctly stated that a court is not bound by the prosecutor’s legal classification of the offence, the terms of the indictment were nevertheless exceeded because the first-instance court put the accused in a less favourable position by convicting him of two criminal offences instead of one ...” 35.The relevant part of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23May 1969 (“the Vienna Convention”) provides: “1.A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.>The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes: (a)any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty; (b)any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.>There shall be taken into account, together with the context: (a)any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions; (b)any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation; (c)any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.>A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.” “Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31: (a)leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or (b)leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.” “1.When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is equally authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.>A version of the treaty in a language other than one of those in which the text was authenticated shall be considered an authentic text only if the treaty so provides or the parties so agree.>The terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text.>Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1, when a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the application of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.” 36.The relevant part ofcommon Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 reads: “In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions: (1)Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed ‘hors de combat’ by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria. To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons (a)violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture; (b)taking of hostages; (c)outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment; (d)the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. ...” 37.The relevant parts of the Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field (Geneva, 12 August 1949 – hereinafter “the First Geneva Convention”) read: “The High Contracting Parties undertake to enact any legislation necessary to provide effective penal sanctions for persons committing, or ordering to be committed, any of the grave breaches of the present Convention defined in the following Article. Each High Contracting Party shall be under the obligation to search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, such grave breaches, and shall bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, before its own courts. It may also, if it prefers, and in accordance with the provisions of its own legislation, hand such persons over for trial to another High Contracting Party concerned, provided such High Contracting Party has made out a ‘prima facie’ case. ...” “Grave breaches to which the preceding Article relates shall be those involving any of the following acts, if committed against persons or property protected by the Convention: wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, and extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly.” 38.Articles 50 and 51 of the Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea (Geneva, 12 August 1949) contain the same text as Articles 49 and 50 of the First Geneva Convention. 39.Articles 129 and 130 of the Convention (III) relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (Geneva, 12 August 1949) contain the same text as Articles 49 and 50 of the First Geneva Convention. 40.Articles 146 and 147 of the Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (Geneva, 12 August 1949) contain the same text as Articles 49 and 50 of the First Geneva Convention. 41.The relevant part of the Additional Protocol (II) to the Geneva Conventions, relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Geneva, 8 June 1977) reads: “1. All persons who do not take a direct part or who have ceased to take part in hostilities, whether or not their liberty has been restricted, are entitled to respect for their person, honour and convictions and religious practices. They shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction. It is prohibited to order that there shall be no survivors.> Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the following acts against the persons referred to in paragraph I are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever: (a) violence to the life, health and physical or mental well-being of persons, in particular murder as well as cruel treatment such as torture, mutilation or any form of corporal punishment; ...” “...> At the end of hostilities, the authorities in power shall endeavour to grant the broadest possible amnesty to persons who have participated in the armed conflict, or those deprived of their liberty for reasons related to the armed conflict, whether they are interned or detained.” “1. The civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations. To give effect to this protection, the following rules shall be observed in all circumstances.> The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited.> Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this part, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.” 42.The relevant parts of this Convention read as follows: “The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.” “Persons committing genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in Article 3 shall be punished, whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals.” “The Contracting Parties undertake to enact, in accordance with their respective Constitutions, the necessary legislation to give effect to the provisions of the present Convention and, in particular, to provide effective penalties for persons guilty of genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in Article 3.” 43.The relevant part of this Convention reads as follows: “No statutory limitation shall apply to the following crimes, irrespective of the date of their commission: (a)War crimes as they are defined in the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, Nürnberg, of 8 August 1945 and confirmed by resolutions 3 (I) of 13February 1946 and 95 (I) of 11 December 1946 of the General Assembly of the United Nations, particularly the ‘grave breaches’ enumerated in the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 for the protection of war victims; (b)Crimes against humanity whether committed in time of war or in time of peace as they are defined in the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, Nürnberg, of 8 August 1945 and confirmed by resolutions 3 (I) of 13 February 1946 and 95 (I) of 11 December 1946 of the General Assembly of the United Nations, eviction by armed attack or occupation and inhuman acts resulting from the policy of apartheid, and the crime of genocide as defined in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, even if such acts do not constitute a violation of the domestic law of the country in which they were committed.” “If any of the crimes mentioned in article I is committed, the provisions of this Convention shall apply to representatives of the State authority and private individuals who, as principals or accomplices, participate in or who directly incite others to the commission of any of those crimes, or who conspire to commit them, irrespective of the degree of completion, and to representatives of the State authority who tolerate their commission.” “The States Parties to the present Convention undertake to adopt all necessary domestic measures, legislative or otherwise, with a view to making possible the extradition, in accordance with international law, of the persons referred to in article II of this Convention.” “The States Parties to the present Convention undertake to adopt, in accordance with their respective constitutional processes, any legislative or other measures necessary to ensure that statutory or other limitations shall not apply to the prosecution and punishment of the crimes referred to in articles I and II of this Convention and that, where they exist, such limitations shall be abolished.” 44.Article 20 of the Statute reads: “1.Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.>No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.>No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7 or 8 shall be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court: (a)Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court; or (b)Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice.” 45.Mandated by the States convened at the 26th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) presented in 2005 a Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law (J.-M. Henckaerts and L. Doswald-Beck (eds.), Customary International Humanitarian Law, 2 Volumes, Cambridge University Press & ICRC, 2005). This Study contains a list of customary rules of international humanitarian law. Rule 159, which refers to noninternational armed conflicts, reads: “At the end of hostilities, the authorities in power must endeavour to grant the broadest possible amnesty to persons who have participated in a non-international armed conflict, or those deprived of their liberty for reasons related to the armed conflict, with the exception of persons suspected of, accused of or sentenced for war crimes.” 46.The relevant part of the Resolution reads: “The Security Council, ...>Urges the Government of the Republic of Croatia to eliminate ambiguities in implementation of the Amnesty Law, and to implement it fairly and objectively in accordance with international standards, in particular by concluding all investigations of crimes covered by the amnesty and undertaking an immediate and comprehensive review with United Nations and local Serb participation of all charges outstanding against individuals for serious violations of international humanitarian law which are not covered by the amnesty in order to end proceedings against all individuals against whom there is insufficient evidence; ...” 47.Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCR) 1966 provides: “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation.” 48.The United Nations Human Rights Committee noted in 1992 in its General Comment No. 20 on Article 7 of the International Covenant that some States had granted amnesty in respect of acts of torture. It went on to state that “[a]mnesties are generally incompatible with the duty of States to investigate such acts; to guarantee freedom from such acts within their jurisdiction; and to ensure that they do not occur in the future. States may not deprive individuals of the right to an effective remedy, including compensation and such full rehabilitation as may be possible”. 49.Paragraph 12 reads as follows: “12.The Committee notes with concern the amnesty granted to civilian and military personnel for human rights violations they may have committed against civilians during the civil war. Such a sweeping amnesty may prevent the appropriate investigation and punishment of the perpetrators of past human rights violations, undermine efforts to establish respect for human rights, and constitute an impediment to efforts undertaken to consolidate democracy.” 50.Paragraph 11 reads as follows: “The Committee is concerned with the implications of the Amnesty Law. While that law specifically states that the amnesty does not apply to war crimes, the term ‘war crimes’ is not defined and there is a danger that the law will be applied so as to grant impunity to persons accused of serious human rights violations. The Committee regrets that it was not provided with information on the cases in which the Amnesty Law has been interpreted and applied by the courts. The State party should ensure that in practice the Amnesty Law is not applied or utilized for granting impunity to persons accused of serious human rights violations.” “18.Where the investigations referred to in paragraph 15 reveal violations of certain Covenant rights, States Parties must ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. As with failure to investigate, failure to bring to justice perpetrators of such violations could in and of itself give rise to a separate breach of the Covenant. These obligations arise notably in respect of those violations recognized as criminal under either domestic or international law, such as torture and similar cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment (article 7), summary and arbitrary killing (article 6) and enforced disappearance (articles 7 and 9 and, frequently, 6). Indeed, the problem of impunity for these violations, a matter of sustained concern by the Committee, may well be an important contributing element in the recurrence of the violations. When committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, these violations of the Covenant are crimes against humanity (see Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, article 7). Accordingly, where public officials or State agents have committed violations of the Covenant rights referred to in this paragraph, the States Parties concerned may not relieve perpetrators from personal responsibility, as has occurred with certain amnesties (see General Comment 20 (44)) and prior legal immunities and indemnities. Furthermore, no official status justifies persons who may be accused of responsibility for such violations being held immune from legal responsibility. ...” 51.The relevant parts of this Convention provide: “1.Each State Party shall ensure that all acts of torture are offences under its criminal law. The same shall apply to an attempt to commit torture and to an act by any person which constitutes complicity or participation in torture.>Each State Party shall make these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature.” “1.The State Party in the territory under whose jurisdiction a person alleged to have committed any offence referred to in article 4 is found shall in the cases contemplated in article 5, if it does not extradite him, submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. ...” “Each State Party shall ensure that its competent authorities proceed to a prompt and impartial investigation, wherever there is reasonable ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed in any territory under its jurisdiction.” “Each State Party shall ensure that any individual who alleges he has been subjected to torture in any territory under its jurisdiction has the right to complain to, and to have his case promptly and impartially examined by, its competent authorities. Steps shall be taken to ensure that the complainant and witnesses are protected against all ill-treatment or intimidation as a consequence of his complaint or any evidence given.” “1.Each State Party shall ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation, including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible. In the event of the death of the victim as a result of an act of torture, his dependants shall be entitled to compensation.>Nothing in this article shall affect any right of the victim or other persons to compensation which may exist under national law.” 52.The relevant parts of the resolutions on impunity read: “The Commission on Human Rights, ...>Also emphasizes the importance of taking all necessary and possible steps to hold accountable perpetrators, including their accomplices, of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, recognizes that amnesties should not be granted to those who commit violations of international humanitarian and human rights law that constitute serious crimes and urges States to take action in accordance with their obligations under international law; ...” “The Commission on Human Rights, ...>Also recognizes that amnesties should not be granted to those who commit violations of human rights and international humanitarian law that constitute crimes, urges States to take action in accordance with their obligations under international law and welcomes the lifting, waiving, or nullification of amnesties and other immunities; ...” “The Commission on Human Rights, ...>Also recognizes that amnesties should not be granted to those who commit violations of human rights and international humanitarian law that constitute crimes, urges States to take action in accordance with their obligations under international law and welcomes the lifting, waiving, or nullification of amnesties and other immunities, and recognizes as well the Secretary-General’s conclusion that United Nationsendorsed peace agreements can never promise amnesties for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, or gross violations of human rights; ...” 53.The relevant text of the Resolution on human rights in the world and Community human rights policy for the years 1991 to 1992 reads: “The European Parliament, ...>Believes that the problem of impunity ... can take the form of amnesty, immunity, extraordinary jurisdiction and constrains democracy by effectively condoning human rights infringements and distressing victims;>Affirms that there should be no question of impunity for those responsible for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia ...” 54.In 1998, in the conclusions and recommendations of his fifth report on the question of the human rights of all persons subjected to any form of detention or imprisonment, in particular, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights stated with respect to the Draft Statute for an International Criminal Court: “228. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur is aware of suggestions according to which nationally granted amnesties could be introduced as a bar to the proposed court[‘s] jurisdiction. He considers any such move subversive not just of the project at hand, but of international legality in general. It would gravely undermine the purpose of the proposed court, by permitting States to legislate their nationals out of the jurisdiction of the court. It would undermine international legality, because it is axiomatic that States may not invoke their own law to avoid their obligations under international law. Since international law requires States to penalize the types of crime contemplated in the draft statute of the court in general, and torture in particular, and to bring perpetrators to justice, the amnesties in question are, ipso facto, violations of the concerned States’ obligations to bring violators to justice. ...” 55.The relevant part of the Furundžija case (judgment of 10 December 1998) reads: “155. The fact that torture is prohibited by a peremptory norm of international law has other effects at the inter-state and individual levels. At the inter-state level, it serves to internationally de-legitimise any legislative, administrative or judicial act authorising torture. It would be senseless to argue, on the one hand, that on account of the jus cogens value of the prohibition against torture, treaties or customary rules providing for torture would be null and void ab initio, and then be unmindful of a State say, taking national measures authorising or condoning torture or absolving its perpetrators through an amnesty law. If such a situation were to arise, the national measures, violating the general principle and any relevant treaty provision, would produce the legal effects discussed above and in addition would not be accorded international legal recognition. Proceedings could be initiated by potential victims if they had locus standi before a competent international or national judicial body with a view to asking it to hold the national measure to be internationally unlawful; or the victim could bring a civil suit for damage in a foreign court, which would therefore be asked inter alia to disregard the legal value of the national authorising act. What is even more important is that perpetrators of torture acting upon or benefiting from those national measures may nevertheless be held criminally responsible for torture, whether in a foreign State, or in their own State under a subsequent regime. In short, in spite of possible national authorisation by legislative or judicial bodies to violate the principle banning torture, individuals remain bound to comply with that principle. As the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg put it: ‘individuals have international duties which transcend the national obligations of obedience imposed by the individual State.’” 56.The relevant part of this Convention reads as follows: “1.The States Parties to this Convention undertake to respect the rights and freedoms recognized herein and to ensure to all persons subject to their jurisdiction the free and full exercise of those rights and freedoms, without any discrimination for reasons of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, economic status, birth, or any other social condition.>For the purposes of this Convention, ‘person’ means every human being.” 57.In 1992, in a report on a case with respect to the Las Hojas massacres in El Salvador in 1983 during which about seventy-four persons were allegedly killed by members of the Salvadoran armed forces with the participation of members of the Civil Defence, and which had led to a petition before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the latter held that: “... The application of [El Salvador’s 1987 Law on Amnesty to Achieve National Reconciliation] constitutes a clear violation of the obligation of the Salvadoran Government to investigate and punish the violations of the rights of the Las Hojas victims, and to provide compensation for damages resulting from the violations ... The present amnesty law, as applied in these cases, by foreclosing the possibility of judicial relief in cases of murder, inhumane treatment and absence of judicial guarantees, denies the fundamental nature of the most basic human rights. It eliminates perhaps the single most effective means of enforcing such rights, the trial and punishment of offenders.” 58.In 1994, in a report on the situation of human rights in El Salvador, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights stated, with regard to El Salvador’s General Amnesty Law for Consolidation of Peace, as follows: “... regardless of any necessity that the peace negotiations might pose and irrespective of purely political considerations, the very sweeping General Amnesty Law [for Consolidation of Peace] passed by El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly constitutes a violation of the international obligations it undertook when it ratified the American Convention on Human Rights, because it makes possible a ‘reciprocal amnesty’ without first acknowledging responsibility ...; because it applies to crimes against humanity, and because it eliminates any possibility of obtaining adequate pecuniary compensation, primarily for victims.” 59.In 1999, in a report on a case concerning El Salvador’s 1993 General Amnesty Law for Consolidation of Peace, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights stated: “113.The Commission should emphasize that [this law] was applied to serious human rights violations in El Salvador between January 1, 1980, and January 1, 1992, including those examined and established by the Truth Commission. In particular, its effect was extended, among other things, to crimes such as summary executions, torture, and the forced disappearance of persons. Some of these crimes are considered of such gravity as to have justified the adoption of special conventions on the subject and the inclusion of specific measures for preventing impunity in their regard, including universal jurisdiction and inapplicability of the statute of limitations. ... ... 115.The Commission also notes that Article 2 of [this law] was apparently applied to all violations of common Article 3 [of the 1949 Geneva Conventions] and of the [1977 Additional] Protocol II, committed by agents of the State during the armed conflict which took place in El Salvador. ... ... 123.... in approving and enforcing the General Amnesty Law, the Salvadoran State violated the right to judicial guarantees enshrined in Article 8(1) of the [1969 American Convention on Human Rights], to the detriment of the surviving victims of torture and of the relatives of ..., who were prevented from obtaining redress in the civil courts; all of this in relation to Article 1(1) of the Convention. ... 129.... in promulgating and enforcing the Amnesty Law, El Salvador has violated the right to judicial protection enshrined in Article 25 of the [1969 American Convention on Human Rights], to the detriment of the surviving victims ...” In its conclusions, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights stated that El Salvador “ha[d] also violated, with respect to the same persons, common Article 3 of the Four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Article 4 of the [1977 Additional] Protocol II”. Moreover, in order to safeguard the rights of the victims, it recommended that El Salvador should “if need be, ... annul that law ex-tunc”. 60.In its judgment in Barrios Altos v. Peru ((merits), judgment of 14March 2001, Series C No. 75) involving the question of the legality of Peruvian amnesty laws, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights stated: “41.This Court considers that all amnesty provisions, provisions on prescription and the establishment of measures designed to eliminate responsibility are inadmissible, because they are intended to prevent the investigation and punishment of those responsible for serious human rights violations such as torture, extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary execution and forced disappearance, all of them prohibited because they violate non-derogable rights recognized by international human rights law. 42.The Court, in accordance with the arguments put forward by the Commission and not contested by the State, considers that the amnesty laws adopted by Peru prevented the victims’ next of kin and the surviving victims in this case from being heard by a judge ...; they violated the right to judicial protection ...; they prevented the investigation, capture, prosecution and conviction of those responsible for the events that occurred in Barrios Altos, thus failing to comply with Article 1(1) of the [1969 American Convention on Human Rights], and they obstructed clarification of the facts of this case. Finally, the adoption of self-amnesty laws that are incompatible with the [1969 American Convention on Human Rights] meant that Peru failed to comply with the obligation to adapt internal legislation that is embodied in Article 2 of the [1969 American Convention on Human Rights]. 43.The Court considers that it should be emphasized that, in the light of the general obligations established in Articles 1(1) and 2 of the [1969 American Convention on Human Rights], the States Parties are obliged to take all measures to ensure that no one is deprived of judicial protection and the exercise of the right to a simple and effective recourse, in the terms of Articles 8 and 25 of the [1969 American Convention on Human Rights]. Consequently, States Parties to the [1969 American Convention on Human Rights] which adopt laws that have the opposite effect, such as self-amnesty laws, violate Articles 8 and 25, in relation to Articles 1(1) and 2 of the [1969 American Convention on Human Rights]. Self-amnesty laws lead to the defenselessness of victims and perpetuate impunity; therefore, they are manifestly incompatible with the aims and spirit of th[at] Convention. This type of law precludes the identification of the individuals who are responsible for human rights violations, because it obstructs the investigation and access to justice and prevents the victims and their next of kin from knowing the truth and receiving the corresponding reparation. 44.Owing to the manifest incompatibility of self-amnesty laws and the American Convention on Human Rights, the said laws lack legal effect and may not continue to obstruct the investigation of the grounds on which this case is based or the identification and punishment of those responsible, nor can they have the same or a similar impact with regard to other cases that have occurred in Peru, where the rights established in the [1969 American Convention on Human Rights] have been violated.” In his concurring opinion, Judge Antônio A. Cançado Trindade added: “13.The international responsibility of the State for violations of internationally recognized human rights, – including violations which have taken place by means of the adoption and application of laws of self-amnesty, – and the individual penal responsibility of agents perpetrators of grave violations of human rights and of International Humanitarian Law, are two faces of the same coin, in the fight against atrocities, impunity, and injustice. It was necessary to wait many years to come to this conclusion, which, if it is possible today, is also due, – may I insist on a point which is very dear to me, – to the awakening of the universal juridical conscience, as the material source par excellence of International Law itself.” 61.In Almonacid-Arellano et al. v. Chile (preliminary objections, merits, reparations and costs), judgment of 26September 2006, Series C No. 154, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights noted: “154.With regard to the ne bis in idem principle, although it is acknowledged as a human right in Article 8(4) of the American Convention, it is not an absolute right, and therefore, is not applicable where: i) the intervention of the court that heard the case and decided to dismiss it or to acquit a person responsible for violating human rights or international law, was intended to shield the accused party from criminal responsibility; ii) the proceedings were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with due procedural guarantees, or iii) there was no real intent to bring those responsible to justice. A judgment rendered in the foregoing circumstances produces an ‘apparent’ or ‘fraudulent’ res judicata case. On the other hand, the Court believes that if there appear new facts or evidence that make it possible to ascertain the identity of those responsible for human rights violations or for crimes against humanity, investigations can be reopened, even if the case ended in an acquittal with the authority of a final judgment, since the dictates of justice, the rights of the victims, and the spirit and the wording of the American Convention supersedes the protection of the ne bis in idem principle. 155.In the instant case, two of the foregoing conditions are met. Firstly, the case was heard by courts which did not uphold the guarantees of jurisdiction, independence and impartiality. Secondly, the application of Decree Law No. 2.191 did actually prevent those allegedly responsible from being brought before the courts and favored impunity for the crime committed against Mr. Almonacid-Arellano. The State cannot, therefore, rely on the ne bis in idem principle to avoid complying with the order of the Court ...” 62.The same approach was followed in La Cantuta v. Peru (merits, reparations and costs), judgment of 29 November 2006, Series C No. 162, the relevant part of which reads as follows: “151.In this connection, the Commission and the representatives have asserted that the State has relied on the concept of double jeopardy to avoid punishing some of the alleged instigators of these crimes; however, double jeopardy does not apply inasmuch as they were prosecuted by a court who had no jurisdiction, was not independent or impartial and failed to meet the requirements for competent jurisdiction. In addition, the State asserted that ‘involving other people who might be criminally liable is subject to any new conclusions reached by the Ministerio Público [General Attorney’s Office] and the Judiciary in investigating the events and meting out punishments’, and that ‘the military court’s decision to dismiss the case has no legal value for the General Attorney’s Office’s preliminary investigation. That is, the double jeopardy defense does not apply.’ 152.This Court had stated earlier in the Case of Barrios Altos that This Court considers that all amnesty provisions, provisions on prescription and the establishment of measures designed to eliminate responsibility are inadmissible, because they are intended to prevent the investigation and punishment of those responsible for serious human rights violations such as torture, extra-legal, summary or arbitrary execution and forced disappearance, all of them prohibited because they violate non-derogable rights recognized by international human rights law. 153.Specifically, in relation with the concept of double jeopardy, the Court has recently held that the non bis in idem principle is not applicable when the proceeding in which the case has been dismissed or the author of a violation of human rights has been acquitted, in violation of international law, has the effect of discharging the accused from criminal liability, or when the proceeding has not been conducted independently or impartially pursuant to the due process of law. A judgment issued in the circumstances described above only provides ‘fictitious’ or ‘fraudulent’ grounds for double jeopardy. 154.Therefore, in its complaint against the alleged instigators of the crimes ..., who were discharged by the military courts, the Procuraduría Ad Hoc (Ad Hoc Prosecutor’s Office) deemed it inadmissible to consider the order for dismissal of the case issued by the military judges in the course of a proceeding aimed at granting impunity as a legal obstacle for conducting prosecutions or as a final judgment, since the judges had no jurisdiction and were not impartial, and thus the order may not provide grounds for double jeopardy.” 63.In Anzualdo Castro v. Peru (preliminary objection, merits, reparations and costs), judgment of 22September 2009, Series C No. 202, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights reiterated that: “182.... [T]he State must remove all obstacles, both factual and legal, that hinder the effective investigation into the facts and the development of the corresponding legal proceedings, and use all available means to expedite such investigations and proceedings, in order to ensure the non-repetition of facts such as these. Specially, this is a case of forced disappearance that occurred within a context of a systematic practice or pattern of disappearances perpetrated by state agents; therefore, the State shall not be able to argue or apply a law or domestic legal provision, present or future, to fail to comply with the decision of the Court to investigate and, if applicable, criminally punish th[ose] responsible for the facts. For this reason and as ordered by this Tribunal since the delivery of the Judgment in the case of Barrios Altos v. Peru, the State can no longer apply amnesty laws, which lack legal effects, present or future ..., or rely on concepts such as the statute of limitations on criminal actions, res judicata principle and the double jeopardy safeguard or resort to any other measure designated to eliminate responsibility in order to escape from its duty to investigate and punish th[ose] responsible.” 64.In Gelman v. Uruguay ((merits and reparations), judgment of 24February 2011, Series C No. 221), the Inter-American Court analysed at length the position under international law with regard to amnesties granted for grave breaches of fundamental human rights. In so far as relevant, the judgment reads as follows: “184.The obligation to investigate human rights violations falls within the positive measures that States must adopt in order to ensure the rights recognized in the Convention and is an obligation of means rather than of results, which must be assumed by the State as [a] legal obligation and not as a mere formality preordained to be ineffective that depends upon the procedural initiative of the victims or their next of kin, or upon the production of evidence by private parties. ... 189.The mentioned international obligation to prosecute, and if criminal responsibility is determined, punish the perpetrators of the human rights violations, is encompassed in the obligation to respect rights enshrined in Article 1(1) of the American Convention and implies the right of the States Parties to organize all of the governmental apparatus, and in general, all of the structures through which the exercise of public power is expressed, in a way such that they are capable of legally guaranteeing the free and full exercise of human rights. 190.As part of this obligation, the States must prevent, investigate, and punish all violations of the rights recognized in the Convention, and seek, in addition, the reestablishment, if possible, of the violated right and, where necessary, repair the damage caused by the violation of human rights. 191.If the State’s apparatus functions in a way that assures the matter remains with impunity, and it does not restore, in as much as is possible, the victim’s rights, it can be ascertained that the State has not complied with the obligation to guarantee the free and full exercise of those persons within its jurisdiction. ... 195.Amnesties or similar forms have been one of the obstacles alleged by some States in the investigation, and where applicable, punishment of those responsible for serious human rights violations. This Court, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the organs of the United Nations, and other universal and regional organs for the protection of human rights have ruled on the non-compatibility of amnesty laws related to serious human rights violations with international law and the international obligations of States. 196.As it has been decided prior, this Court has ruled on the non-compatibility of amnesties with the American Convention in cases of serious human rights violations related to Peru (Barrios Altos and La Cantuta), Chile (Almonacid Arellano et al.), and Brazil (Gomes Lund et al.). 197.In the Inter-American System of Human Rights, of which Uruguay forms part by a sovereign decision, the rulings on the non-compatibility of amnesty laws with conventional obligations of States when dealing with serious human rights violations are many. In addition to the decisions noted by this Court, the Inter-American Commission has concluded, in the present case and in others related to Argentina, Chile, El Salvador, Haití, Perú and Uruguay its contradiction with international law. The Inter-American Commission recalled that it: 198.In the Universal forum, in its report to the Security Council, entitled The rule of law and transitional justice in societies that suffer or have suffered conflicts, the Secretary General of the United Nations noted that: 199.In the same sense, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights concluded that amnesties and other analogous measures contribute to impunity and constitute an obstacle to the right to the truth in that they block an investigation of the facts on the merits and that they are, therefore, incompatible with the obligations incumbent on States given various sources of international law. More so, in regards to the false dilemma between peace and reconciliation, on the one hand, and justice on the other, it stated that: 200.In line with the aforementioned, the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on the issue of impunity, stated that: 201.The General Assembly of the United Nations established in Article 18 of the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance that ‘persons who have or are alleged to have committed [enforced disappearance] shall not benefit from any special amnesty law or similar measures that might have the effect of exempting them from any criminal proceedings or sanction.’ 202.The World Conference on Human Rights which took place in Vienna in 1993, in its Declaration and Program of Action, emphasized that States ‘should derogate legislation that favors the impunity of those responsible for serious human rights violations, [...] punish the violations,’ highlighting that in those cases States are obligated first to prevent them, and once they have occurred, to prosecute the perpetrators of the facts. 203.The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances of the United Nations has handled, on various occasions, the matter of amnesties in cases of enforced disappearances. In its General Comments regarding Article 18 of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons Against Enforced Disappearance, it noted that it considers amnesty laws to be contrary to the provisions of the Declaration, even when it has been approved in referendum or by another similar type of consultation process, if directly or indirectly, due to its application or implementation, it terminates the State’s obligation to investigate, prosecute, and punish those responsible for the disappearances, if it hides the names of those who perpetrated said acts, or if it exonerates them. 204.In addition, the same Working Group stated its concern that in situations of post-conflict, amnesty laws are promulgated or other measures adopted that have impunity as a consequence, and it reminded States that: 205.Also in the universal forum, the bodies of human rights protection established by treaties have maintained the same standards concerning the prohibition of amnesties that prevent the investigation and punishment of those who commit serious human rights crimes. The Human Rights Committee, in its General Comment 31, stated that States should assure that those guilty of infractions recognized as crimes in international law or in national legislation, among others—torture and other acts of cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment, summary deprivations of life, and arbitrary detention, and enforced disappearances—appear before the justice system and not attempt to exempt the perpetrators of their legal responsibility, as has occurred with certain amnesty laws. 206.The Human Rights Committee ruled on the matter in the proceedings of individual petitions and in its country reports, noting in the case of Hugo Rodríguez v. Uruguay, that it cannot accept the posture of a State of not being obligated to investigate human rights violations committed during a prior regime given an amnesty law, and it reaffirmed that amnesty laws in regard to serious human rights violations are incompatible with the aforementioned International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, reiterating that they contribute to the creation of an atmosphere of impunity that can undermine upon the democratic order and bring about other serious human rights violations. ... 209.Also in the universal forum, in another branch of international law – that is international criminal law, amnesties or similar norms have been considered inadmissible. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, in a case related to torture, considered that it would not make sense to sustain on the one hand the statute of limitations on the serious human rights violations, and on the other hand to authorize State measures that authorize or condone, or amnesty laws that absolve its perpetrators. Similarly, the Special Court for Sierra Leone considered that the amnesty laws of said country were not applicable to serious international crimes. This universal tendency has been consolidated through the incorporation of the mentioned standard in the development of the statutes of the special tribunals recently created within the United Nations. In this sense, both the United Nations Agreement with the Republic of Lebanon and the Kingdom of Cambodia, as well as the Statutes that create the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and the Extraordinary Chambers of the Courts of Cambodia, have included in their texts, clauses that indicate that the amnesties that are conceded shall not constitute an impediment to the processing of those responsible for crimes that are within the scope of the jurisdiction of said tribunals. 210.Likewise, in an interpretation of Article 6-5 of the Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Convention on International Humanitarian Law, the ICRC stated that amnesties cannot protect perpetrators of war crimes: 211.This norm of International Humanitarian Law and interpretation of Article 6-5 of the Protocol has been adopted by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations. 212.The illegality of the amnesties related to serious violations of human rights vis-à-vis international law have been affirmed by the courts and organs of all the regional systems for the protection of human rights. 213.In the European System, the European Court of Human Rights considered that it is of the highest importance, in what pertains to an effective remedy, that the criminal procedures which refer to crimes, such as torture, that imply serious violations of human rights, not be obstructed by statute of limitations or allow amnesties or pardons in this regard. In other cases, it highlighted that when an agent of the State is accused of crimes violating the rights of Article [2] in the European Convention (Right to life), the criminal proceedings and judgment should not be obstructed, and the granting of amnesty is not permitted. 214.The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights considered that amnesty laws cannot protect the State that adopts them from complying with their international obligations, and noted, in addition, that in prohibiting the prosecution of perpetrators of serious human rights violations via the granting of amnesty, the States not only promote impunity, but also close off the possibility that said abuses be investigated and that the victims of said crimes have an effective remedy in order to obtain reparation. ... 225.This Court has established that ‘amnesty provisions, the statute of limitation provisions, and the establishment of exclusions of responsibility that are intended to prevent the investigation and punish those responsible for serious violations to human rights such as torture, summary, extrajudicial, or arbitrary executions, and enforced disappearance are not admissible, all of which are prohibited for contravening irrevocable rights recognized by International Law of Human Rights.’ 226.In this sense, amnesty laws are, in cases of serious violations of human rights, expressly incompatible with the letter and spirit of the Pact of San José, given that they violate the provisions of Articles 1(1) and 2, that is, in that they impede the investigation and punishment of those responsible for serious human rights violations and, consequently, impede access to victims and their families to the truth of what happened and to the corresponding reparation, thereby hindering the full, timely, and effective rule of justice in the relevant cases. This, in turn, favors impunity and arbitrariness and also seriously affects the rule of law, reason for which, in light of International Law, they have been declared to have no legal effect. 227.In particular, amnesty laws affect the international obligation of the State in regard to the investigation and punishment of serious human rights violations because they prevent the next of kin from being heard before a judge, pursuant to that indicated in Article 8(1) of the American Convention, thereby violating the right to judicial protection enshrined in Article 25 of the Convention precisely for the failure to investigate, persecute, capture, prosecute, and punish those responsible for the facts, thereby failing to comply with Article 1(1) of the Convention. 228.Under the general obligations enshrined in Article 1(1) and 2 of the American Convention, the States Parties have the obligation to take measures of all kinds to assure that no one is taken from the judicial protection and the exercise of their right to a simple and effective remedy, in the terms of Articles 8 and 25 of the Convention, and once the American Convention has been ratified, it corresponds to the State to adopt all the measures to revoke the legal provisions that may contradict said treaty as established in Article 2 thereof, such as those that prevent the investigation of serious human rights violations given that it leads to the defenselessness of victims and the perpetuation of impunity and prevents the next of kin from knowing the truth regarding the facts. 229.The incompatibility with the Convention includes amnesties of serious human rights violations and is not limited to those which are denominated, ‘self-amnesties,’ and the Court, more than the adoption process and the authority which issued the Amnesty Law, heads to its ratio legis: to leave unpunished serious violations committed in international law. The incompatibility of the amnesty laws with the American Convention in cases of serious violations of human rights does not stem from a formal question, such as its origin, but rather from the material aspect in what regards the rights enshrined in Articles 8 and 25, in relation to Articles 1(1) and 2 of the Convention. ... 240.... in applying the provisions of the Expiry Law (which, [to] all inten[ts and] purposes constitutes an amnesty law) and thereby impeding the investigation of the facts and the identification, prosecution, and possible punishment of the possible perpetrators of continued and permanent injuries such as those caused by enforced disappearance, the State fails to comply with its obligation to adapt its domestic law enshrined in Article 2 of the Convention.” 65.In Gomes Lund et al. (“Guerrilha do Araguaia”) v. Brazil ((preliminary objections, merits, reparations and costs), judgment of 24 November 2010, Series C No. 219) the Inter-American Court again strongly opposed the granting of amnesties for grave breaches of fundamental human rights. After relying on the same international law standard as in the above-cited Gelman case, it held, in so far as relevant, as follows: “171.As is evident from the content of the preceding paragraphs, all of the international organs for the protection of human rights and several high courts of the region that have had the opportunity to rule on the scope of amnesty laws regarding serious human rights violations and their compatibility with international obligations of States that issue them, have noted that these amnesty laws impact the international obligation of the State to investigate and punish said violations. 172.This Court has previously ruled on the matter and has not found legal basis to part from its constant jurisprudence that, moreover, coincides with that which is unanimously established in international law and the precedent of the organs of the universal and regional systems of protection of human rights. In this sense, regarding the present case, the Court reiterates that ‘amnesty provisions, the statute of limitation provisions, and the establishment of exclusions of responsibility that are intended to prevent the investigation and punishment of those responsible for serious violations to human rights such as torture, summary, extrajudicial, or arbitrary executions, and enforced disappearance are not admissible, all of which are prohibited for contravening irrevocable rights recognized by International Law of Human Rights.’ ... 175.In regard to the that argued by the parties[‘ arguments] regarding whether the case deals with an amnesty, self-amnesty, or ‘political agreement,’ the Court notes, as is evident from the criteria stated in the present case (supra para. 171), that the non-compatibility with the Convention includes amnesties of serious human rights violations and is not limited to those which are denominated, ‘self-amnesties.’ Likewise, as has been stated prior, the Court, more than the adoption process and the authority which issued the Amnesty Law, heads to its ratio legis: to leave unpunished serious violations in international law committed by the military regime. The non-compatibility of the amnesty laws with the American Convention in cases of serious violations of human rights does not stem from a formal question, such as its origin, but rather from the material aspect as they breach the rights enshrined in Articles 8 and 25, in relation to Articles 1(1) and 2 of the Convention. 176.This Court has established in its jurisprudence that it is conscious that the domestic authorities are subject to the rule of law, and as such, are obligated to apply the provisions in force of the legal code. However, when a State is a Party to an international treaty such as the American Convention, all of its organs, including its judges, are also subject to it, wherein they are obligated to ensure that the effects of the provisions of the Convention are not reduced by the application of norms that are contrary to the purpose and end goal and that from the onset lack legal effect. The Judicial Power, in this sense, is internationally obligated to exercise ‘control of conventionality’ ex officio between the domestic norms and the American Convention, evidently in the framework of its respective jurisdiction and the appropriate procedural regulations. In this task, the Judicial Power must take into account not only the treaty, but also the interpretation that the Inter-American Court, as the final interpreter of the American Convention, has given it.” 66.More recently, in the case of The Massacres of El Mozote and Nearby Places v. El Salvador ((merits, reparations and costs), judgment of 25 October 2012, Series C No. 252) the Inter-American Court, in so far as relevant for the present case, held as follows (footnotes omitted): “283.In the cases of Gomes Lund v. Brazil and Gelman v. Uruguay, decided by this Court within the sphere of its jurisdictional competence, the Court has already described and developed at length how this Court, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the organs of the United Nations, other regional organizations for the protection of human rights, and other courts of international criminal law have ruled on the incompatibility of amnesty laws in relation to grave human rights violations with international law and the international obligations of States. This is because amnesties or similar mechanisms have been one of the obstacles cited by States in order not to comply with their obligation to investigate, prosecute and punish, as appropriate, those responsible for grave human rights violations. Also, several States Parties of the Organization of American States, through their highest courts of justice, have incorporated the said standards, observing their international obligations in good faith. Consequently, for purposes of this case, the Court reiterates the inadmissibility of ‘amnesty provisions, provisions on prescription, and the establishment of exclusions of responsibility that seek to prevent the investigation and punishment of those responsible for grave human rights violations such as torture, summary, extrajudicial or arbitrary execution, and forced disappearance, all of which are prohibited because they violate non-derogable rights recognized by international human rights law.’ 284.However, contrary to the cases examined previously by this Court, the instant case deals with a general amnesty law that relates to acts committed in the context of an internal armed conflict. Therefore, the Court finds it pertinent, when analyzing the compatibility of the Law of General Amnesty for the Consolidation of Peace with the international obligations arising from the American Convention and its application to the case of the Massacres of El Mozote and Nearby Places, to do so also in light of the provisions of Protocol II Additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, as well as of the specific terms in which it was agreed to end hostilities, which put an end to the conflict in El Salvador and, in particular, of Chapter I (‘Armed Forces’), section 5 (‘End to impunity’), of the Peace Accord of January 16, 1992. 285.According to the international humanitarian law applicable to these situations, the enactment of amnesty laws on the conclusion of hostilities in non-international armed conflicts are sometimes justified to pave the way to a return to peace. In fact, article 6(5) of Protocol II Additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions establishes that: 286.However, this norm is not absolute, because, under international humanitarian law, States also have an obligation to investigate and prosecute war crimes. Consequently, ‘persons suspected or accused of having committed war crimes, or who have been convicted of this’ cannot be covered by an amnesty. Consequently, it may be understood that article 6(5) of Additional Protocol II refers to extensive amnesties in relation to those who have taken part in the non-international armed conflict or who are deprived of liberty for reasons related to the armed conflict, provided that this does not involve facts, such as those of the instant case, that can be categorized as war crimes, and even crimes against humanity.” 67.The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, in the Decision on Ieng Sary’s Appeal against the Closing Order (case no.002/1909-2007-ECCC/OCIJ (PTC75) of 11 April 2011), discussing the effects of the amnesty on prosecution, stated: “199.The crimes charged in the Closing Order, namely genocide, crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, and homicide, torture and religious persecution as national crimes, are not criminalised under the 1994 Law and would therefore continue to be prosecuted under existing law, be it domestic or international criminal law, even if perpetrated by alleged members of the Democratic Kampuchea group. ... 201.The interpretation of the Decree proposed by the Co-Lawyers for Ieng Sary, which would grant Ieng Sary an amnesty for all crimes committed during the Khmer Rouge era, including all crimes charged in the Closing Order, not only departs from the text of the Decree, read in conjunction with the 1994 Law, but is also inconsistent with the international obligations of Cambodia. Insofar as genocide, torture and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions are concerned, the grant of an amnesty, without any prosecution and punishment, would infringe upon Cambodia’s treaty obligations to prosecute and punish the authors of such crimes, as set out in the Genocide Convention, the Convention Against Torture and the Geneva Conventions. Cambodia, which has ratified the ICCPR, also had and continues to have an obligation to ensure that victims of crimes against humanity which, by definition, cause serious violations of human rights, were and are afforded an effective remedy. This obligation would generally require the State to prosecute and punish the authors of violations. The grant of an amnesty, which implies abolition and forgetfulness of the offence for crimes against humanity, would not have conformed with Cambodia’s obligation under the ICCPR to prosecute and punish authors of serious violations of human rights or otherwise provide an effective remedy to the victims. As there is no indication that the King (and others involved) intended not to respect the international obligations of Cambodia when adopting the Decree, the interpretation of this document proposed by the Co-Lawyers is found to be without merit.” 68.On 13 March 2004 the Appeals Chamber of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, in Cases Nos. SCSL-2004-15-AR72(E) and SCSL-2004-16-AR72(E), adopted its Decision on Challenge to Jurisdiction: Lomé Accord Amnesty, in which it observed the following: “82.The submission by the Prosecution that there is a ‘crystallising international norm that a government cannot grant amnesty for serious violations of crimes under international law’ is amply supported by materials placed before this Court. The opinion of both amici curiae that it has crystallised may not be entirely correct, but that is no reason why this court in forming its own opinion should ignore the strength of their argument and the weight of materials they place before the Court. It is accepted that such a norm is developing under international law. Counsel for Kallon submitted that there is, as yet, no universal acceptance that amnesties are unlawful under international law, but, as amply pointed out by Professor Orentlicher, there are several treaties requiring prosecution for such crimes. These include the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the four Geneva conventions. There are also quite a number of resolutions of the UN General Assembly and the Security Council reaffirming a state obligation to prosecute or bring to justice. Redress has appended to its written submissions materials which include relevant conclusions of the Committee against torture, findings of the Human Rights Commission, and relevant judgments of the Inter-American Court. ... 84.Even if the opinion is held that Sierra Leone may not have breached customary law in granting an amnesty, this court is entitled in the exercise of its discretionary power, to attribute little or no weight to the grant of such amnesty which is contrary to the direction in which customary international law is developing and which is contrary to the obligations in certain treaties and conventions the purpose of which is to protect humanity.”",2014,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

125,001-67226,Grand Chamber,"12.The first applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Woking. 13.On 9 August 1994, following a surveillance and undercover operation, he was arrested in a van in the company of an undercover police officer known only as “Graham”. In the van was a briefcase containing 4.83kilograms of 50% pure heroin. On 7 April 1995 the applicant was convicted in Snaresbrook Crown Court of possessing a Class A drug with intent to supply and was sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment. 14.The first applicant’s defence was that at the time of his arrest he believed he was taking part in a transaction to sell stolen jewellery. He alleged that his participation had been organised by a man named GeoffreyLerway, whom he had met the previous year while both were detained on remand in Brixton Prison. According to the applicant, the week before his arrest Lerway had introduced him to a man called Jim Humphries and a man introduced to him only as “Martin”. The day before the arrest, the applicant was contacted by Lerway and asked if he would be interested in going to in connection with a jewellery deal in which Lerway was acting as intermediary to Martin. He would be given a cut of the purchase price. The applicant agreed that Lerway would pick him up from his home the next day. 15.The following morning he was told that the plans had changed, as Martin was now coming to . The first applicant agreed to accompany Lerway to a public house where, at approximately 12.45 p.m., a red Jaguar and a white van drew up. The driver of the Jaguar was introduced to the applicant as “Jeff”; he was accompanied by a man and a woman, subsequently addressed as “Terry” and “Carol”. The driver of the van was introduced as “Graham”. Jeff gave Lerway a briefcase containing 125,000pounds sterling (GBP). They all then left in convoy for the , Primrose Hill, where they were to meet Martin. 16.At the hotel, Lerway decided to stay with the money in the car and asked the applicant to see if Martin had arrived. The applicant therefore went into the hotel where he met Jim Humphries, who told him that the arrangements had changed again as Martin was now in Euston. Humphries and Lerway asked the applicant to take a taxi to Euston and ask Martin to return with him to the . The applicant followed these instructions and found Martin, who told him he had to leave immediately for another meeting. Martin, having spoken to Humphries or Lerway on a mobile phone, gave the applicant the key to a room in the nearby Ibis Hotel, and explained that the “goods” were in a briefcase in the room. 17.According to the applicant, Graham came from Primrose Hill in his van and met the applicant outside the Ibis Hotel. Graham then suggested that the applicant should accompany him up to the room and offered to give him a lift back to Primrose Hill afterwards. In the hotel room, Graham forced the lock on the case while the applicant was in the bathroom, and when he came out Graham was ready to go. They returned to the van, where the briefcase was opened, and within moments the applicant was arrested. 18.Of all the participants in the above transaction, only the applicant was arrested and charged. The applicant suspects that the other participants were undercover police officers or informers acting on police instructions, but their identities and status have never been revealed to him. In this regard, he considers it relevant that, at the time of the alleged dealings, Lerway was on bail to the Middlesex Crown Court in respect of a large-scale conspiracy to supply cannabis. One of the conspirators was a former Flying Squad detective. It was known to the applicant that Lerway had acted as a participating police informer in that case and it was further known that the police officers involved in the applicant’s case had also investigated the conspiracy for which Lerway was on bail. The applicant believes that sentencing in Lerway’s trial was deliberately postponed until 12 April 1995, some five days after the conclusion of the applicant’s own trial, as a disincentive for Lerway to come forward and give evidence concerning the true nature of the transaction. 19.Prior to the commencement of the applicant’s trial, the prosecution gave notice to the defence that an application to withhold material evidence had been made ex parte in advance of the trial under the procedure approved in R. v. Davis, Johnson and Rowe (see paragraph 37 below). Judge Owen Stable QC, who considered the material in the absence of the defence, concluded that it would not assist the defence and that there were genuine public interest grounds for withholding it. This ruling was subsequently reconsidered by the trial judge, who had the benefit of a document prepared by the defence outlining the issues in the case, as well as of the oral submissions of defence counsel. In the course of the proceedings before the Chamber, the Government revealed for the first time that the material placed before the trial judge had included information indicating that the applicant had been involved in the supply of heroin before the start of the undercover operation. The subject matter of the public interest immunity evidence was not disclosed to the applicant during the domestic proceedings, either at first instance or on appeal. The trial judge, who directed himself in accordance with the approach set out by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Keane (see paragraph 39 below), decided that the evidence in question would not assist the defence and found genuine public interest grounds in favour of non-disclosure. 20.Following the ruling on disclosure, the defence made an application to the trial judge under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE – see paragraph 32 below) to exclude the evidence of Graham, on the basis that the applicant had been entrapped into committing the offence. These submissions were rejected. The judge held that in the course of the ex parte application he had heard nothing and seen no material which would have assisted the defence in their argument that evidence should be excluded under section 78 on grounds of entrapment. He continued that, if he had seen or heard any such material, he would have ordered disclosure. 21.Apart from the applicant, Graham was the only participant in the offence to give evidence at the trial. He testified that the applicant had made a number of incriminating statements to him when they were alone together in the van and hotel room. Although Graham claimed to have made a full note of the alleged conversations, these notes were never shown to the applicant and the applicant was not questioned in connection with their content by the investigating police officers. According to the applicant, it was, however, difficult for the defence to undermine Graham’s credibility because his full name and other identifying details were not disclosed. 22.Following his conviction, the applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground, inter alia, that the judge had been wrong to refuse to order disclosure. Dismissing the appeal on 18 July 1996, the Court of Appeal, having itself examined the undisclosed evidence, observed that “each one of us reached the clearest possible view that nothing in the documents withheld could possibly have assisted the defence at trial; indeed quite the reverse”. 23.The second applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Tonbridge. Prior to the events in question, he had been of good character and employed as accounts director in a firm which had gone into liquidation a year earlier. At the time of his arrest in July 1995, he was unemployed and in considerable debt. 24.The applicant’s version of events, which he maintained from the time of his first interview with the police, was that he had been introduced to a man named “Terry” by an acquaintance, Colin Phelps, since Terry appeared interested in purchasing from the applicant some bankrupt stock. At a meeting in July 1995, Terry had started talking about counterfeit currency and had pressed the applicant to obtain some as part of the transaction. Although the applicant had never hitherto been involved with counterfeit currency, he did have a contact, “John”, who was able to supply forged banknotes. 25.Terry went on to introduce the applicant to two men called “Jag” and “Jazz”. At a third meeting on 14 July 1995, Jag turned up with “Chris”, who was subsequently revealed to be an undercover police officer, and an order for a large amount of currency was placed. It appears from the transcript of covert tape recordings made during this meeting that, while the applicant was not unwilling to become involved, he was actively encouraged to do so by Jag and Chris, who put a certain amount of pressure on him to supply more notes of a higher denomination than had at first been agreed. On 25July 1995 the applicant met Chris and another undercover officer, “Ian”, in a public house car park. He showed them some counterfeit notes, and was immediately arrested by uniformed officers. More counterfeit notes were found when his house was searched. 26.The applicant maintained that he had been entrapped by undercover police officers and/or participating informers into committing the offences. On 11 November 1996 he applied to the Crown Court judge for an order that the indictment should be stayed on the grounds that, as a result of the covert activities of undercover police officers and/or participating informers, (a) it was not possible for him to have a fair trial and (b) the moral integrity of the criminal proceedings had been impaired. He also requested the judge to order the prosecution to provide more information and documents, including information relating to the question whether Colin Phelps, Terry or “Tel”, Jazz or Jag were participating informers or undercover police officers. 27.Prior to making his ruling on the defence application, the judge heard, ex parte, an application by the prosecution to withhold certain material evidence on grounds of public interest immunity. The judge refused to grant a stay or to order further disclosure, indicating that most of the information sought was subject to public interest immunity. He also ruled that, while it was clear that Chris had been coaxing the applicant, there was no evidence of pressure having been applied. 28.A second submission was then made on the applicant’s behalf to exclude the evidence of undercover police officers under section 78 of PACE. However, before evidence was called from the officers in question – Chris and Ian –defence counsel sought guidance from the judge as to the areas of cross-examination which would or would not be allowed, given that certain issues relating to the investigation were covered by public interest immunity. It became apparent that most of the areas of cross-examination necessary to develop the submission were not to be allowed. Accordingly, the submission was withdrawn and the applicant entered guilty pleas to the indictment on 12 November 1996. 29.On 20 November 1996 he was sentenced to a total of four and a half years’ imprisonment. 30.On 28 November 1996 counsel advised that the applicant had no prospects of success in appealing against conviction, since he would have to demonstrate that the convictions were unsafe before an appeal could succeed. This would be impossible given that, on his own account, he had been motivated by money to enter into the deal to sell counterfeit currency. Counsel also expressed the view that: “Had there been anything within the [public interest immunity] material which could have assisted the Defendant in developing his case to exclude the evidence under s.78 PACE I am confident the Judge would have released it. In those circumstances, I advise that there are no grounds of appeal against conviction.” 31.The fact that a defendant would not have committed an offence were it not for the activity of an undercover police officer or an informer acting on police instructions does not provide a defence under English law. The judge does, however, have a discretion to order a stay of a prosecution where it appears that entrapment has occurred, as the House of Lords affirmed in R. v. Looseley; Attorney-General’s Reference (no. 3 of 2000) ([2001] United Kingdom House of Lords Decisions 53), a judgment which followed and approved earlier case-law, including case-law which applied at the time of the applicants’ trials (for example, the judgment of the House of Lords in R. v. Latif [1996] 1 Weekly Law Reports 104). In Looseley, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead explained (§ 1): “My Lords, every court has an inherent power and duty to prevent abuse of its process. This is a fundamental principle of the rule of law. By recourse to this principle courts ensure that executive agents of the State do not misuse the coercive, law-enforcement functions of the courts and thereby oppress citizens of the State. Entrapment ... is an instance where such misuse may occur. It is simply not acceptable that the State through its agents should lure its citizens into committing acts forbidden by the law and then seek to prosecute them for doing so. That would be entrapment. That would be a misuse of State power, and an abuse of the process of the courts. The unattractive consequences, frightening and sinister in extreme cases, which State conduct of this nature could have are obvious. The role of the courts is to stand between the State and its citizens and make sure this does not happen.” 32.In addition, the court has a discretion, under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, to exclude evidence obtained by an undercover police officer where, inter alia, the defendant would not have committed the offence without police incitement (see R. v. Smurthwaite; R.v. Gill (1994) 98 Criminal Appeal Reports 437, judgment of the Court of Appeal; and Looseley, cited above). Of the two remedies, the grant of a stay, rather than the exclusion of evidence, is the more appropriate remedy because a prosecution founded on entrapment is an abuse of the court’s process and should not have been brought in the first place. 33.In Looseley, the House of Lords agreed that it was not possible to set out a comprehensive definition of unacceptable police conduct or “State-created crime”. In each case it was for the judge, having regard to all the circumstances, to decide whether the conduct of the police or other law-enforcement agency was so seriously improper as to bring the administration of justice into question. Factors to be taken into account included the nature of the offence, the reason for the particular police operation, the possibility of using other methods of detection and the nature and extent of police participation in the crime; the greater the inducement offered by the police, and the more forceful and persistent the police overtures, the more readily a court might conclude that the police had overstepped the boundary, since their conduct might well have brought about the commission of a crime by a person who would normally avoid crime of that kind. The police should act in good faith to uncover evidence of criminal acts which they reasonably suspected the accused was about to commit or was already engaged in committing, and the police operation should be properly supervised. The defendant’s criminal record was unlikely to be relevant unless it could be linked to other factors grounding reasonable suspicion that he or she had been engaged in the criminal activity in question prior to the involvement of the police (per Lord Nicholls, §§2629; Lord Hoffmann, §§ 50-71). 34.At common law, the prosecution has a duty to disclose any material which has or might have some bearing on the offence charged. This duty extends to any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial and statements of any witnesses potentially favourable to the defence. 35.In December 1981 the Attorney-General issued guidelines, which did not have force of law, concerning exceptions to the common-law duty to disclose to the defence evidence of potential assistance to it ((1982) 74 Criminal Appeal Reports 302 – “the Guidelines”)). According to the Guidelines, the duty to disclose was subject to a discretionary power for prosecuting counsel to withhold relevant evidence if it fell within one of the categories set out in paragraph 6. One of these categories (6(iv)) was “sensitive” material which, because of its sensitivity, it would not be in the public interest to disclose. “Sensitive material” was defined as follows: “... (a) it deals with matters of national security; or it is by, or discloses the identity of, a member of the Security Services who would be of no further use to those services once his identity became known; (b) it is by, or discloses the identity of, an informant and there are reasons for fearing that the disclosure of his identity would put him or his family in danger; (c) it is by, or discloses the identity of, a witness who might be in danger of assault or intimidation if his identity became known; (d) it contains details which, if they became known, might facilitate the commission of other offences or alert someone not in custody that he is a suspect; or it discloses some unusual form of surveillance or method of detecting crime; (e) it is supplied only on condition that the contents will not be disclosed, at least until a subpoena has been served upon the supplier – e.g. a bank official; (f) it relates to other offences by, or serious allegations against, someone who is not an accused, or discloses previous convictions or other matters prejudicial to him; (g) it contains details of private delicacy to the maker and/or might create risk of domestic strife.” 36.In R. v. Ward ([1993] 1 Weekly Law Reports 619), the Court of Appeal stressed that the court and not the prosecution was to decide whether or not relevant evidence should be retained on grounds of public interest immunity. It explained that “... a judge is balancing on the one hand the desirability of preserving the public interest in the absence of disclosure against, on the other hand, the interests of justice. Where the interests of justice arise in a criminal case touching and concerning liberty or conceivably on occasion life, the weight to be attached to the interests of justice is plainly very great indeed”. 37.In R. v. Davis, Johnson and Rowe ([1993] 1 Weekly Law Reports613), the Court of Appeal held that it was not necessary in every case for the prosecution to give notice to the defence when it wished to claim public interest immunity, and outlined three different procedures to be adopted. The first procedure, which had generally to be followed, was for the prosecution to give notice to the defence that they were applying for a ruling by the court and indicate to the defence at least the category of the material which they held. The defence would then have the opportunity to make representations to the court. Secondly, however, where the disclosure of the category of the material in question would in effect reveal that which the prosecution contended should not be revealed, the prosecution should still notify the defence that an application to the court was to be made, but the category of the material need not be disclosed and the application should be ex parte. The third procedure would apply in an exceptional case where to reveal even the fact that an ex parte application was to be made would in effect be to reveal the nature of the evidence in question. In such cases the prosecution should apply to the court ex parte without notice to the defence. 38.The Court of Appeal observed that although ex parte applications limited the rights of the defence, in some cases the only alternative would be to require the prosecution to choose between following an inter partes procedure or declining to prosecute, and in rare but serious cases the abandonment of a prosecution in order to protect sensitive evidence would be contrary to the public interest. It referred to the important role performed by the trial judge in monitoring the views of the prosecution as to the proper balance to be struck and remarked that, even in cases in which the sensitivity of the information required an ex parte hearing, the defence had “as much protection as can be given without pre-empting the issue”. Finally, it emphasised that it was for the trial judge to continue to monitor the position as the trial progressed. Issues might emerge during the trial which affected the balance and required disclosure “in the interests of securing fairness to the defendant”. For this reason it was important for the same judge who heard any disclosure application also to conduct the trial. 39.The leading case on disclosure at the time of the applicants’ trials was the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R. v. Keane ([1994] 1 Weekly Law Reports 746). The Lord Chief Justice, giving the judgment of the court, held that the prosecution should put before the judge only those documents which it regarded as material but wished to withhold on grounds of public interest immunity. “Material” evidence was defined as evidence which could be seen, “on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution: (1) to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case; (2) to raise or possibly raise a new issue whose existence is not apparent from the evidence which the prosecution proposes to use; (3) to hold out a real (as opposed to fanciful) prospect of providing a lead on evidence which goes to (1) or (2)”. 40.Once the judge was seized of the material, he or she had to perform the balancing exercise between the public interest in non-disclosure and the importance of the documents to the issues of interest, or likely to be of interest, to the accused. If the disputed material might prove the defendant’s innocence or avoid a miscarriage of justice, the balance came down firmly in favour of disclosing it. Where, on the other hand, the material in question would not be of assistance to the accused, but would in fact assist the prosecution, the balance was likely to be in favour of non-disclosure. 41.In the case of R. v. Turner ([1995] 1 Weekly Law Reports 264), the Court of Appeal returned to the balancing exercise, stating, inter alia: “Since R. v. Ward ... there has been an increasing tendency for defendants to seek disclosure of informants’ names and roles, alleging that those details are essential to the defence. Defences that the accused has been set up, and allegations of duress, which used at one time to be rare, have multiplied. We wish to alert judges to the need to scrutinise applications for disclosure of details about informants with very great care. They will need to be astute to see that assertions of a need to know such details, because they are essential to the running of the defence, are justified. If they are not so justified, then the judge will need to adopt a robust approach in declining to order disclosure. Clearly, there is a distinction between cases in which the circumstances raise no reasonable possibility that information about the informant will bear upon the issues and cases where it will. Again, there will be cases where the informant is an informant and no more; other cases where he may have participated in the events constituting, surrounding, or following the crime. Even when the informant has participated, the judge will need to consider whether his role so impinges on an issue of interest to the defence, present or potential, as to make disclosure necessary ...” 42.The requirements of disclosure have since been set out in a statutory scheme. Under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (CIPA), which came into force in England and Wales immediately upon gaining Royal Assent on 4 July 1996, the prosecution must make “primary disclosure” of all previously undisclosed evidence which, in the prosecutor’s view, might undermine the case for the prosecution. The defendant must then give a defence statement to the prosecution and the court, setting out in general terms the nature of the defence and the matters on which the defence takes issue with the prosecution. The prosecution must then make a “secondary disclosure” of all previously undisclosed material “which might reasonably be expected to assist the accused’s defence as disclosed by the defence statement”. Disclosure by the prosecution may be subject to challenge by the accused and review by the trial court. 43.Following the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in Chahal v. the United Kingdom (15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V) and Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom (10 July 1998, Reports 1998IV), the United Kingdom introduced legislation making provision for the appointment of a “special counsel” in certain cases involving national security. The provisions are contained in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 (“the 1997 Act”) and the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”). Under this legislation, where it is necessary on national security grounds for the relevant tribunal to sit in camera, in the absence of the affected individual and his or her legal representatives, the Attorney-General may appoint a special counsel to represent the interests of the individual in the proceedings. The legislation provides that the special counsel is not however “responsible to the person whose interest he is appointed to represent”, thus ensuring that the special counsel is both entitled and obliged to keep confidential any information which cannot be disclosed. The relevant rules giving effect to the 1997 and 1998 Acts are set out in the Court’s judgment in Jasper v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no.27052/95, § 36, 16 February 2000). 44.In December 1999 the government commissioned a comprehensive review of the criminal justice system, under the chairmanship of a senior Court of Appeal judge, Sir Robin Auld. The report, published in September 2001 after extensive consultation and entitled “The Review of the Criminal Courts in and ” (“the Auld Report”), recommended, inter alia, the introduction of a “special counsel” scheme in cases where the prosecution wished to seek, ex parte, non-disclosure on grounds of public interest immunity. The recommendation was explained in the Auld Report as follows (footnotes omitted): “193.The scheme [developed by the common law since R. v. Ward and reflected in the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996: see above] is an improvement on what went before and has been generally welcomed on that account. But there is widespread concern in the legal professions about lack of representation of the defendant’s interest in the [ex parte] forms of application, and anecdotal and reported instances of resultant unfairness to the defence. ... A suggestion, argued on behalf of applicants in and widely supported in the Review, is that the exclusion of the defendant from the procedure should be counterbalanced by the introduction of a ‘special independent counsel’. He would represent the interest of the defendant at first instance and, where necessary, on appeal on a number of issues: first, as to the relevance of the undisclosed material if and to the extent that it has not already been resolved in favour of disclosure but for a public interest immunity claim; second, on the strength of the claim to public interest immunity; third, on how helpful the material might be to the defence; and fourth, generally to safeguard against the risk of judicial error or bias. 194.In my view, there is much to be said for such a proposal, regardless of the vulnerability or otherwise of the present procedures to Article 6. Tim Owen QC, in a paper prepared for the Review, has argued powerfully in favour of it. It would restore some adversarial testing of the issues presently absent in the determination of these often critical and finely balanced applications. It should not be generally necessary for special counsel to be present throughout the trial. Mostly the matter should be capable of resolution by the court before trial and, if any question about it arises during trial, he could be asked to return. If, because of the great number of public interest immunity issues now being taken in the courts, the instruction of special counsel for each would be costly, it simply indicates, as Owen has commented, the scale of the problem and is not an argument against securing a fair solution. 195.The role would be similar to that of an amicus curiae brought in to give independent assistance to a court, albeit mostly on appeal. In rape cases, where an unrepresented defendant seeks to cross-examine a complainant, the court must inform him that he may not do so, and should he refuse to instruct counsel, the court will appoint and instruct one. After the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in Chahal and Tinnelly, the government introduced such a procedure in immigration cases involving national security. Although such cases are extremely rare, it is sufficient that the principle of a ‘third’ or ‘special’ counsel being instructed on behalf of a defendant has been conceded in a number of areas. 196.The introduction of a system of special independent counsel could, as Owen has also noted, in part fill a lacuna in the law as to public interest immunity hearings in the absence of a defendant appellant in the Court of Appeal, to which the 1996 Act and supporting Rules do not apply. Where there has been a breach of Article 6 because a trial judge did not conduct a public interest immunity hearing due to the emergence of the material only after conviction, the European Court of Human Rights has held that the breach cannot be cured by a hearing before the Court of Appeal in the absence of the appellant. The Court’s reasons for so holding were that the appeals court is confined to examining the effect of non-disclosure on the trial ex post facto and could possibly be unconsciously influenced by the jury’s verdict into underestimating the significance of the undisclosed material. 197.However, even the introduction of special counsel to such hearings would not solve the root problem to which I have referred of police failure, whether out of incompetence or dishonesty, to indicate to the prosecutor the existence of critical information. Unless, as I have recommended, the police significantly improve their performance in that basic exercise, there will be no solid foundation for whatever following safeguards are introduced into the system. I recommend the introduction of a scheme for instruction by the court of special independent counsel to represent the interests of the defendant in those cases at first instance and on appeal where the court now considers prosecution applications in the absence of the defence in respect of the non-disclosure of sensitive material.” 45.In R. v. H.; R. v. C. [2004] United Kingdom House of Lords Decisions 3, decided on 5 February 2004 after the Chamber judgment in the present case, the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords held, inter alia: “The years since the decision in R. v. Davis [see paragraph 37 above] and the enactment of the CIPA [see paragraph 42 above] have witnessed the introduction in some areas of the law of a novel procedure designed to protect the interests of a party against whom an adverse order may be made and who cannot (either personally or through his legal representative), for security reasons, be fully informed of all the material relied on against him. The procedure is to appoint a person, usually called a ‘special advocate’, who may not disclose to the subject of the proceedings the secret material disclosed to him, and is not in the ordinary sense professionally responsible to that party but who, subject to those constraints, is charged to represent that party’s interests. ... There is as yet little express sanction in domestic legislation or domestic legal authority for the appointment of a special advocate or special counsel to represent, as an advocate in PII [public interest immunity from disclosure] matters, a defendant in an ordinary criminal trial ... But novelty is not of itself an objection, and cases will arise in which the appointment of an approved advocate as special counsel is necessary, in the interests of justice, to secure protection of a criminal defendant’s right to a fair trial. Such an appointment does however raise ethical problems, since a lawyer who cannot take full instructions from his client, nor report to his client, who is not responsible to his client and whose relationship with the client lacks the quality of confidence inherent in any ordinary lawyer-client relationship, is acting in a way hitherto unknown to the legal profession. While not insuperable, these problems should not be ignored, since neither the defendant nor the public will be fully aware of what is being done. The appointment is also likely to cause practical problems: of delay, while the special counsel familiarises himself with the detail of what is likely to be a complex case; of expense, since the introduction of an additional, high-quality advocate must add significantly to the cost of the case; and of continuing review, since it will not be easy for a special counsel to assist the court in its continuing duty to review disclosure, unless the special counsel is present throughout or is instructed from time to time when need arises. Defendants facing serious charges frequently have little inclination to cooperate in a process likely to culminate in their conviction, and any new procedure can offer opportunities capable of exploitation to obstruct and delay. None of these problems should deter the court from appointing special counsel where the interests of justice are shown to require it. But the need must be shown. Such an appointment will always be exceptional, never automatic; a course of last and never first resort. It should not be ordered unless and until the trial judge is satisfied that no other course will adequately meet the overriding requirement of fairness to the defendant. ...”",2004,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

80,001-70662,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicant was born in 1938 and currently lives in Lancashire. 10.In 1953 he joined the British army at 15 years of age. He served with the Royal Engineers between February 1954 and April 1968, when he was discharged for reasons unrelated to the present application. In 1981 he was diagnosed as suffering from hypertension and late onset bronchial asthma and in 1989 he was found to have high blood pressure and chronic obstructive airways disease (bronchitis – COAD). He has not worked since 1992 or thereabouts and is registered as an invalid. 11.The Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment at Porton Down (“Porton Down”) was established during the First World War in order to conduct research into chemical weapons with a view to advancing the protection of the United Kingdom's armed forces against such weapons. The research included tests of gases on humans as well as on animals. Servicemen who participated in the tests were paid extra wages. 12.The applicant participated in such tests at Porton Down. While there was some debate as to whether he attended in 1962, it was not disputed that he did so in July 1963. His service medical records contained no record of any tests at Porton Down. 13.The applicant alleged as follows. In the spring of 1962 he was invited to Porton Down; he was medically examined on arrival; he was asked on three or four occasions to enter a sealed and unventilated room, where he was seated and strapped to a chair; over a period of about six hours, drops of mustard gas were applied to patches of tissue which were then taped to his skin; he was told that, if he was unlucky, he might suffer temporary pain or discomfort but otherwise he was not given any, or any proper, warning about the possible consequences of the tests for his health; once the tests were finished he returned to his unit; there was no further medical examination after he left Porton Down. He relied on a memorandum and file note of 13 November 1989 (see paragraph 24 below) and on the conclusions in this respect of 14 January 2004 of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal (“the PAT” – see paragraph 63 below) to substantiate his participation in tests in 1962. 14.While the Government did not deny that participation, they pointed to a number of matters that appeared to militate against such a conclusion: the summary and alphabetical record books did not refer to his attendance in 1962 but only to his attendance in 1963; there was no documentary evidence at all of the 1962 tests whereas certain records existed of his 1963 tests; and if the PAT had accepted his participation in the 1962 tests, this was based solely on his recollections. 15.The nerve gas (known as “G-agent” or “GF”) test is described in the relevant records as “exposure to single-breath GF”. The applicant alleged that he was told before the test that the experiment “could not harm a mouse”; that he was placed in an air-tight, glass-partitioned cubicle containing a face mask, the mask was placed over his mouth and nose, the fitting was checked and the chamber was sealed; that a loudspeaker informed him that the test was about to begin and to inhale normally; that he felt an immediate tightening of the chest muscles and lungs which wore off after the end of the test; and that blood samples were taken at regular intervals during the following twenty-four hours. The Government submitted that diluted GF vapours were put into a gas chamber and, as the name of the test suggested, volunteers took a single breath of air with calculated doses of GF gas through a tube connected to that chamber, they held their breath for two seconds and then exhaled. 16.The other test involved mustard gas and was described in the records as “H sensitivity and penetration”. According to the applicant, it followed the same format as that in 1962. The Government added the following detail: the mustard gas test was designed to test the performance of protective clothing and was carried out in two parts. The first was a sensitivity test to determine an individual's sensitivity to mustard gas and it involved the placement of a dilute solution of the gas on the participant's upper arm. If after twenty-four hours the test subject had a small red mark, he or she was deemed too sensitive and did not participate any further in the tests. On the other hand, if the participant was not demonstrably sensitive, the second part consisted of putting a drop of dilute mustard gas solution on three samples of protective clothing left in place on the participant's body and the skin under the clothing was examined after six and then twenty-four hours. The participants were monitored before and after the tests. The rooms were properly ventilated, the dosages were small and safe and the tests were carefully planned and controlled. 17.From 1981 the applicant was medically treated for breathlessness and high blood pressure and by 1987 these problems had significantly worsened. He began to search for his Porton Down records through what he described as “medical” and “political” channels. 18.In response to his doctor's enquiry, in late 1987 the Ministry of Defence (MOD) supplied his doctor with his service medical records on a “medical in confidence” basis. Those records did not refer to the applicant's Porton Down tests. 19.In a letter of 14 November 1989, Porton Down responded to another enquiry from his doctor. The letter was sent on a “medical in confidence” basis and confirmed the applicant's participation in a GF gas test in July 1963. That GF test had been preceded and succeeded by a full medical examination which revealed no abnormality. The letter also referred (inaccurately, as it later emerged – see paragraph 36 below) to seven blood tests conducted after the GF test and to their results and confirmed that “peak flow meter measurements” had also been taken from the applicant and that “breath-holding tests”, a clothing penetration study (apparently, although not expressly noted, the mustard gas tests) and a battery of personality tests were performed. The results of these tests were not included in the letter and no other records supporting the statements made in the letter were enclosed. His doctor's stamp on it indicates that he decided to tell the applicant that all was normal. The applicant persuaded his doctor to show him the letter in 1994. 20.By a letter dated 14 December 1989, a consultant informed the applicant's doctor that he doubted that the applicant's bronchial asthma was caused by his exposure to nerve gas. Further tests were to be carried out. 21.A letter from Dr H. (a professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds and later the court-appointed expert witness in the PAT proceedings – see paragraphs 42-68 below) dated 5 December 1994 to the applicant stated that full and detailed records were required to judge the long-term effects of his participation in the tests and that a long-term epidemiological study would have been useful either to establish that there were long-term effects or to reassure test participants that there were none. His letter of 10 July 1996 repeated his view as to the need for such a study. 22.An internal Porton Down memorandum of 24 November 1997 noted that certain blood-test figures given in the letter to the applicant's doctor of 14 November 1989 were inaccurate. In addition, it was considered that the applicant's description of the tests was roughly consistent with the procedures in the 1960s. While there were no obvious gaps in the 1960s records, it could not be said that the records were complete: the applicant could have attended in 1962 and his name could have been omitted or incorrectly recorded due to a clerical error. 23.Inter alia, the applicant carried out a sit-in hunger strike at Porton Down, held a press conference in the House of Commons and requested members of parliament to put parliamentary questions. 24.Between 11 and 14 November 1989, the applicant went on hunger strike outside Porton Down. On 13 November 1989 he spoke with the Secretary of Porton Down. The latter noted in a memorandum of that date that the applicant's description of the tests was strong enough to indicate that he had been there and he recommended a further search of the records. He also recorded in a file note (of the same date) that the applicant's description of his visits to Porton Down in 1962 and 1963 left him with a level of confidence that he had been a volunteer there on both occasions. This led to the letter of 14 November 1989 to the applicant's doctor (see paragraph 19 above). 25.In January 1994 the applicant formed the Porton Down Volunteers Association with the object of seeking recognition and redress for test participants. The association has over 300 members to date. 26.By a letter dated 26 January 1994, the Chief Executive of Porton Down answered, at the request of the Secretary of State for Defence, a series of questions raised by a member of parliament about chemical and biological warfare testing. The Chief Executive's letter described the test procedure, stating that participants were given a medical examination before and after the tests and recalled for check-ups “from time to time”. It was pointed out that there was no evidence that the health of participants had deteriorated because of their test participation. On 22 June 1994 the Chief Executive confirmed the well-established policy of the MOD of releasing service medical records to a veteran's doctor on a “medical in confidence” basis. The Chief Executive's letter of 7 March 1995 (in response to a parliamentary question to the Minister of State for Defence) noted that the tests did not include any plan for long-term systematic monitoring of participants: any monitoring thereafter was purely ad hoc and sporadic. 27.On 2 February 1994 the applicant wrote to the MOD requesting copies of his medical records and of reports on the relevant tests. The reply of 9 March 1994 from Porton Down recalled the MOD policy of release on a “medical in confidence” basis. The applicant's doctor had been provided with information in 1989 on this basis. It was “entirely up to your own doctor how much or how little of this information he conveys to you”. Further queries from the applicant led to a similar response from Porton Down by letter dated 20 April 1994. 28.On 12 December 1994 Lord Henley stated in the House of Lords that the MOD would continue to send veterans to their doctors and would release medical records as appropriate. Information was provided to doctors to allow proper diagnosis and “would be released, if necessary”. He repeated that there was no evidence over the previous forty years that test participants had suffered harm to their health. 29.In response to a series of parliamentary questions put to the Secretary of State for Defence as to the necessity for a public inquiry, the government's representative replied on 28 February 1995 that there was no evidence that any test participants had suffered any long-term damage to their health in the past four decades. Similar responses as to the lack of evidence of harm to the test participants were given by the Minister of State for Defence in Parliament on 4 April and 2 May 1995 in response to questions concerning the instigation of a study into the long-term health effects of exposure to chemical and biological substances. 30.On 25 April 1995 the applicant and the Labour Party defence spokesman took part in a press conference on the question of Porton Down volunteers and their requirements. 31.Following a meeting between them, on 2 December 1997 the Minister of State for Defence wrote to the applicant. He referred to the concerns of the applicant (and other test participants) that information about the tests was being withheld. He confirmed that this was not the case but rather reflected “less than thorough” record-keeping than would be currently expected. Henceforth all volunteers would be able to obtain access to all the information held on them at Porton Down and steps would be taken to declassify reports so as to make that information more accessible. Certain copies of test documents were enclosed: (a) the alphabetical record book which recorded the applicant's attendance at Porton Down between 13 and 19 July 1963; (b) the summary record book which referred to the two tests carried out on the applicant involving GF and mustard gas and listed the monitoring procedures that were to be carried out on the applicant (chest X-rays, peak flow meter tests, “x 3 x alcohol” quiz, breath-holding tests and blood tests); and (c) a report entitled “Effects of Inhaled GF on Man” which described the single breath GF test and contained an analysis of the results of the tests carried out on fifty-six participants, believed to include the applicant's test. It was indicated that these documents were available to any test participant who requested them. This was the first material obtained by the applicant about his participation in the tests. The letter went on to note that much GF-related research work had already been published in open literature or was in the Public Record Office. The review of files to be disclosed would continue and the applicant was given a list of all relevant research papers already published between 1957 and 1987. There was no evidence to date to suggest that any volunteer had suffered long-term adverse effects. A full independent and long-term study of the health impacts of test participation was not, however, considered feasible or practical so none had been or would be carried out. 32.In a letter dated 31 August 1999 to the PAT, Porton Down indicated that it was well acquainted with the applicant, having received numerous communications from him and from members of parliament. 33.By a letter dated 3 May 2001, Porton Down informed the applicant that it had discovered some old laboratory notebooks that included information about the 1963 tests: one book included some previously unavailable details of the mustard patch tests. A pre-exposure chest X-ray and the associated report card were also now available. The applicant was to contact Porton Down if he wanted to see this material or obtain copies. 34.As well as those disclosed with the Minister of State's letter of 2December 1997, the following documents were also submitted to the Court. 35.The Government indicated that these were all the relevant records that could be traced: (a) an extract from a laboratory record of results of personality and intelligence tests; (b) extracts from laboratory records of GF blood tests – seven blood samples were taken from the applicant; and (c) an explanation of the GF blood-test results. 36.The Government corrected their previous explanations of the seven blood samples (see paragraph 19 above): one was taken on 13 July 1963, a second one prior to the applicant's exposure to GF and the remaining five were taken later. They also corrected other errors relating to information provided in their earlier observations about those tests including the following: “the reference to '25 milligrams of GF [vapour per kilogram of body weight]' appears to have been a typographical error. In fact, calculated doses of GF ranged from 0.16 to 2.84 microgrammes per kilogramme of body weight.” They also disclosed documents recently discovered following a further search: (a) the applicant's pre-exposure X-ray and its associated report card (see paragraph 33 above); (b) a report dated August 1942 which described the manner in which the sensitivity tests to mustard gas were performed and entitled “Technique of the Physiological Experiments Carried Out on the Human Subjects at [Porton Down]”; and (c) extracts from a laboratory notebook entitled “Overgarment Tests. Mustard on Men”, relating to mid-July 1963 and referring to the applicant. 37.On 10 June 1991 the applicant claimed a service pension on the grounds of “hypertension/breathing problems” resulting from the Porton Down tests (and, in addition, from his radiation exposure on Christmas Island during the relevant nuclear tests there). The Department of Social Security (DSS) obtained copies of his service and civilian medical records together with a report from his doctor, which confirmed that he suffered from hypertension, COAD and late onset bronchial asthma. On 28January 1992 the Secretary of State rejected his claim for a service pension as there was no causal link demonstrated between the tests and those medical conditions. The applicant did not pursue an appeal at that stage. 38.The applicant consulted solicitors in 1994 and obtained legal aid for proceedings. By a letter dated 14 November 1994 to the Secretary of State, his solicitors threatened proceedings, alleging, inter alia, negligence, assault and breach of statutory duty on the part of the MOD, and demanding the release of all medical and laboratory records in the possession of the Secretary of State or of Porton Down as regards the test periods in 1962 and 1963, failing which the applicant would apply to the High Court for pre-action discovery. The applicant's representatives met with MOD representatives in early January 1995 on a “without prejudice” basis and by a letter dated 5 June 1995 requested confirmation from the MOD as to whether a certificate would be issued under section 10 of the 1947 Act (“a section 10 certificate”). 39.By a letter dated 4 July 1995 to the applicant's solicitors, the claims section of the MOD wrote as follows: “War Pensions Agency has informed me that a section 10 certificate in respect of acute bronchitis (1963), a bruised knee and loss of hearing will be regarded as attributable to service and a section 10 certificate will be issued. The other ailments for which [the applicant] claimed a war pension have not been regarded as attributable to service.” 40.On 3 August 1995 a section 10 certificate was signed by the Secretary of State: “In so far as the personal injury of [the applicant] is due to anything suffered as a result of his service in the Army between 16 February 1954 and 2 April 1968, I hereby certify that his suffering that thing has been treated as attributable to service for the purpose of entitlement to an award under the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983, which relates to disablement or death of members of the Army.” 41.By a letter dated 8 August 1995, the Treasury Solicitor provided a copy of the section 10 certificate to the applicant's representatives. 42.Following the judgment of this Court in McGinley and Egan v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III) and the Government's disclosure of certain documents in their observations in the present case (on 9 March 1998), the applicant requested an adjournment of the present application in order to pursue an appeal to the PAT and, in particular, disclosure of documents under Rule 6 of the Pensions Appeal Tribunals (England and Wales) Rules 1980 (“the PAT Rules”). The present application was adjourned. 43.On 1 June 1998 he lodged his PAT appeal. Since the War Pensions Agency (“the WPA” – a specialised agency of the Department of Social Security) clarified that a further form was required, on 8 November 1998 the applicant re-lodged the appeal. 44.In February 1999 the applicant received his “Statement of Case”. He obtained two extensions of the time-limit for the submission of his “answer” to the Statement of Case (to take advice from an expert chemical pathologist on the documents already disclosed and on those which were also to be requested during the PAT appeal and to consider the intervening observations of the Government in the present application) and he indicated that he would be making an application under Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules. 45.On 30 July 1999 his answer was submitted to the WPA along with a letter which noted that the answer included an application for disclosure of documents under Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules: paragraph 18 of the answer set out a list of seventeen categories of document required by him under that rule. 46.On 10 August 1999 the WPA responded by pointing out that enquiries were being made to obtain all the information requested under Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules. Once received, the WPA would ask for the agreement of the President of the PAT to disclose it. 47.On the same day the WPA wrote to Porton Down enclosing a copy of the applicant's Rule 6 request and asking for the information as soon as possible so that the agreement of the President of the PAT could be obtained. 48.On 14 March and 13 April 2000 the WPA sent the supplementary Statement of Case (now incorporating the supplemental medical evidence) to the applicant and to the PAT, respectively. 49.On 3 August 2000 the President of the PAT responded to the applicant's enquiry, indicating that his case had not been listed as it awaited production of further documentary evidence and the Secretary of State's response. However, since the Rule 6 request should not have been made in the applicant's answer to the Statement of Case, that request had just come to light. The applicant was to confirm to the President if he intended paragraph 18 of his answer to constitute his Rule 6 request and, if so, the President would be grateful to receive any observations that would assist his consideration of the relevance of the documents to the appeal issues. The applicant was also to identify the State department to which a Rule 6 direction should be addressed. 50.On 9 November 2000 the applicant confirmed to the President of the PAT that paragraph 18 of his answer did indeed constitute his Rule 6 request and he made detailed submissions on the matters requested by the President. 51.By a letter dated 13 November 2000, the President of the PAT requested the applicant to submit a draft direction and attend a hearing on it since he was concerned that the wording of some parts of the Rule 6 request appeared to be ambiguous and lacking in clarity. The applicant submitted a draft direction (essentially listing those documents already included in paragraph 18 of his answer). 52.By an order dated 1 February 2001, the President of the PAT directed, pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules, disclosure of the scheduled documents by the Secretary of State since the documents “were likely to be relevant to the issues to be determined in the appeal”. 53.On 6 July 2001 the Secretary of State responded to the direction of the President of the PAT. It was marked “medical in confidence”. It referred to the documents already submitted by the Government to this Court (see paragraphs 34-36 above). The Secretary of State was unable to give a definitive response to the request for the fifth category of document required (namely, “any scientific or medical reports, whether published or prepared for internal use by Porton Down, the [MOD] or other government departments or agencies of the volunteer studies or experiments in Porton Down between 1957 and 1968 which were similar or related to the studies or experiments in which [the applicant] was involved”). A full and careful review had been undertaken and was a time-consuming process. Many of the documents identified as being possibly relevant to the request were classified. The Secretary of State had asked for an urgent review of the classification to be undertaken and, once the review was completed, he would let the PAT have his full response. Otherwise the Secretary of State provided various explanations of the documents already submitted by the Government to this Court and details of the precise dates on which the applicant would have participated in the tests, of the levels of exposure to gases and of various headings and abbreviations in the disclosed documents. The only documents (additional to those already submitted to this Court) disclosed to the PAT were the applicant's service and payment records, the latter of which included a payment for attendance for a week at Porton Down in July 1963. 54.The MOD's letter was passed to the applicant on 25 July 2001. By a letter dated 19 July 2002, the applicant wrote to the PAT apologising for not having responded and explaining the reasons for the delay. 55.By a letter dated 23 August 2002, the MOD disclosed documents concerning the above-described fifth category: two reports entitled “The feasibility of performing follow-up studies of the health of volunteers attending [Porton Down]” and “The single-breath administration of Sarin”, from which individual names had been blanked out. The feasibility report acknowledged that the records held at Porton Down prior to the late 1970s generally consisted of the name, service number and age of participants at the date of testing but were not “sufficient to allow either a comprehensive morbidity study or mortality study to proceed”. While a study could be carried out on post-1976 test participants, “such a study would be of very limited value and may only serve to draw attention to [Porton Down's] interest in possible long-term health problems experienced by volunteers”. The feasibility report concluded that a comprehensive follow-up study of all volunteers was “impractical”. Porton Down's library catalogue had also mentioned a document entitled “Unique papers relating to early exposure of volunteers to GD [O-Pinacolyl methylphosphonoflouidate, commonly known as Soman] and GF and DM [diphenylaminearsine chloride, commonly known as Adamsite]”. However, a copy of this document could not be located. A letter of 20 August 2002 was also enclosed which certified that nine of the requested documents were “in the nature of departmental minutes or records” and would not therefore be disclosed (Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules). 56.A hearing was fixed for 3 October 2002. On 27 September 2002 the applicant was obliged to request an adjournment since his counsel had advised that further questions needed to be put to Dr H. On 30 September 2002 the PAT declined to adjourn, indicating that it was unlikely Dr H. could or would prepare a report. 57.On 2 October 2002 the MOD wrote to the PAT and the applicant. While nine documents had been previously certified as non-disclosable, (letter of 23 August 2002 – see paragraph 55 above), seven of those nine documents could now be disclosed. The MOD had “had the opportunity of re-examining the documents ... with a view to assessing whether [they] could be the subject of voluntary disclosure ... in an effort to ensure that everything that can be disclosed has been disclosed and so as to ensure the maximum openness and the maximum assistance to the [PAT]”. Certain blocking out had been done on some disclosed documents to protect the identities of staff involved and to excise irrelevant material. Two documents could still not be disclosed: the first did not appear “to contain anything of relevance” to the applicant's tests and, in any event, “contained information which remains security sensitive and is not properly subject to voluntary disclosure on security grounds”; and the second required permission from the United States before it could be disclosed. 58.The appeal was scheduled for 3 October 2002. The applicant applied for an adjournment supported by the Veterans Agency (the successor of the WPA – “the VA”). The PAT decision (delivered on 7 October 2002) recorded as follows: “The [PAT] are deeply disturbed that this application has proved necessary as a result of the [applicant's] advisers' failure to consider documents disclosed over a year ago, in a timely fashion. However, since the [VA] also appear to be without documentation and there is confusion by the [applicant] as to whether he also wishes to appeal for hypertension, we have reluctantly decided to allow the adjournment. It is highly unsatisfactory that Court resources have been wasted in this way. To prevent this happening in the future the Tribunal intend to exercise some control over the ongoing progress of the appeal.” The PAT was to clarify with the MOD the status of certain classified documents and the extent to which they could be released to the public, and directed the MOD to provide, by 21 October 2002, disclosure of further documents. The MOD, the VA and the applicant were to notify the PAT by 18 November 2002 of the questions and documents it wanted Dr H. to examine. It was intended that the PAT would add its own questions and submit a composite questionnaire to Dr H. who would report in response to the PAT. The applicant was also to confirm his position as regards the hypertension appeal by 28 October 2002. 59.On 21 October 2002, the MOD disclosed to the PAT three declassified documents. These were forwarded by the PAT to the applicant by a letter dated 8 November 2002, accompanied by a warning that the MOD had released the documents for the purpose of the appeal and that no information in them was to be used for any other purpose without the consent of the MOD. By a letter dated 25 October 2002, the applicant confirmed that his appeal had been intended to cover hypertension also, he explained the reasons for his confusion and he requested an extension of time to so appeal. A hypertension appeal form was lodged with the PAT on 5 December 2002. 60.By a letter dated 3 December 2002, the PAT wrote to Dr H. enclosing the documents disclosed by the MOD (at that point) with two sets of questions (prepared by the applicant and the medical member of the PAT). By a letter dated 19 February 2003, Dr H. provided the PAT with a report. The applicant having noted that Dr H. had omitted to respond to the PAT questions, Dr H. did so in a supplemental report sent to the PAT under cover of a letter dated 14 May 2003. 61.In a document dated 14 October 2003, the MOD submitted its comments on Dr H.'s reports. On 16 October 2003 the VA submitted a supplementary Statement of Case. 62.The PAT appeal hearing took place on 23 October 2003. It allowed the hypertension appeal to be heard out of time but, once it became clear that the VA had not processed the appeal documentation filed by the applicant, the PAT reluctantly granted the MOD an adjournment to allow the VA time to “properly consider all the evidential material and prepare a reasoned medical opinion”. The COAD appeal was, however, dismissed. 63.On 14 January 2004 the PAT delivered its written decision. As to the facts, the PAT accepted that the applicant had undergone tests for mustard gas “some time in 1962 as well as the documented tests in July 1963” despite the fact that there was no reference in his service records or in other research records to the 1962 test. The PAT also found “disquieting” the “difficulties” experienced by the applicant in obtaining the records which were produced to the PAT. The PAT also established the following facts: “1.We find that [the applicant] suffered no long-term respiratory effect from skin contact with mustard gas following both tests in 1962 and 1963.>We find that [the applicant] was administered only small doses of mustard gas and GF gas which would have resulted in minimal exposure to mustard gas by off-gassing and a limited and transitory reaction to the GF gas. Although no records relating to doses exist, the mustard gas tests were designed to test the suitability of military clothing to exposure and were not a gas test per se. Furthermore, after a fatality at Porton Down in 1953, safeguards were put in place to ensure that volunteers were only exposed to safe dosages.>The compelling weight of the evidence is that [the applicant] did not receive, in any of the tests, dosages likely to have long-term effects as described in the research papers. In particular, the [PAT expert], although accepting the possibility that given further research through a long-term follow-up study a link might be found, concludes that there is no evidence to link [the applicant's] exposure to either gases with his present condition. We accept [the PAT expert's] conclusion that, given the limited doses and [the applicant's] minimal immediate reactions, this would rule out a link between the tests and the claimed conditions.>We particularly rely on [Dr H.'s] expert report. He has analysed the specific data relevant to [the applicant's] case and considered the conditions for which he is claiming in relation to that specific data. The research papers relied on by the [applicant], although of some evidential value, are very general and speculative. We therefore prefer the evidence, and the conclusions reached by [Dr H.] in his reports.” The PAT also accepted, as a matter of law, that it was sufficient to show that the proved service event was only one of the causes of the condition even if there were other contributory factors. However, it stated: “2.We do not accept that the lack of possible evidence of other follow-up tests is sufficient to constitute reliable evidence.>We find that there is some reliable evidence surrounding the Porton Down tests for which [the applicant] volunteered. However, this evidence tends, if anything, to support the view that there is in fact no link between those tests and [the applicant's] current conditions. The test of reasonable doubt is not therefore met.>There is no reliable evidence to suggest a causal link between the tests for either mustard gas or GF gas and the claimed condition.>[The PAT expert's] views that 'he cannot exclude the possibility' of a link between exposure to GF and/or mustard gas and the claimed condition, does not meet the 'reasonable doubt' test. Furthermore, he 'rules out' exposure to GF as a cause and deems it 'unlikely' that mustard gas is a cause.>Finally, [the applicant's counsel] invites us to allow the appeal for reasons which can be summarised as 'general fairness'. The [PAT] does not have legislative or discretionary power to do so. The decision of the [PAT] is to disallow the appeal for [COAD].” 64.On 4 February 2004 the applicant applied to the PAT for leave to appeal to the High Court (on the COAD matter) and for a stay of the hypertension appeal then pending before the PAT. On 26 April 2004 leave was refused, the PAT's reserved decision being delivered on 28 April 2004. 65.On 11 May 2004 the applicant applied for leave to appeal to the High Court. On 13 July 2004 leave was granted. 66.The applicant's appeal notice and supporting skeleton argument were submitted on 10 August 2004. The appeal was listed to be heard on 7October 2004. 67.On 8 October 2004 the High Court allowed the appeal and referred the matter back to the PAT for a further hearing. 68.On 7 March 2005 a directions hearing was held before the PAT. It ordered the hypertension and COAD appeals to be heard together and mutual disclosure of any further documents relevant to the appeal by 18April 2005. On the latter date the Treasury Solicitor produced a “schedule of disclosure” listing and disclosing eleven documents: apart from three items, the applicant had not seen them before. The Treasury Solicitor maintained that disclosure of most of the documents (including two sets of minutes of meetings which Rule 6 specifies can be withheld) was not obligatory as they were of marginal relevance, noted that all documents had been downgraded to “unclassified” and indicated that the MOD would endeavour to produce the annexes referred to in certain documents. 69.The armed forces have, since 1998, put in place a service to deal with enquiries from Porton Down test participants (“the 1998 Scheme”). The relevant information pamphlet noted that participants could request their test records, that a search would be carried out for references to that person and for additional evidence of actual procedures, that a summary would be provided and that, if the person wanted to go to Porton Down, he or she could obtain the actual records. While the pamphlet noted that reasonably comprehensive records had existed since 1942, individuals had to accept that old records in some cases were very sparse, that record keeping in years gone by was not up to current standards and that in certain cases a person's attendance might not even have been marked. The pamphlet claimed that no participant was worse off after the Porton Down tests. 70.In 2001 the Porton Down Volunteers Medical Assessment Programme was established by the MOD to investigate health concerns of Porton Down test participants. The study involved 111 participants but no control group. The report, published in April 2004, was entitled “Clinical Findings in 111 Ex-Porton Down Volunteers”. It noted that over 20,000 had participated in the tests since Porton Down's establishment in 1916 and that 3,000 had participated in nerve gas tests and 6,000 in mustard gas tests, with some servicemen having been exposed to both. It concluded that: “On a clinical basis, no evidence was found to support the hypothesis that participation in Porton Down trials produced any long-term adverse health effects or unusual patterns of disease compared to those of the general population of the same age.” 71.From July 2002 the MOD funded “an initial pilot research project” on mortality and cancer incidence among Porton Down test participants. It compared 500 participants with a control group of 500 other servicemen and the decision was taken that a full-scale epidemiological study should be undertaken. By mid-2003 this had begun and it was expected to take about two years to complete. 72.Further to the death of Aircraftsman Maddison in May 1953 after being exposed to Sarin gas (also referred to as GB gas, a nerve agent related to GF), a coroner's inquest was held and recorded “death by misadventure”. An application was brought for a fresh inquest alleging, inter alia, that incomplete evidence had been brought before the coroner and in November 2002 the Court of Appeal ordered a fresh inquest. It concluded on 15November 2004 with the jury finding that the cause of Mr Maddison's death was the “application of a nerve agent in a non-therapeutic experiment”. Judicial review proceedings appear to be pending. In or around 2004-05 a non-governmental organisation (“Porton Down Veterans”) discovered during searches in the Public Record Office two letters of May and August 1953 containing legal advice from the Treasury Solicitor to the MOD about Mr Maddison's case and about section 10 of the 1947 Act. That organisation sent this material to the Veterans Policy Unit – Legacy Health Issues of the MOD on 7 February 2005. The Treasury Solicitor's letter of August 1953 noted as follows: “When the case was referred to me previously I did consider the relevance of section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 but I came to the conclusion that it had no application. On the information before me I am still of that opinion. Subsection (1) of that section, which deals with injuries caused by acts of members of the Armed Forces, can have no application since the administration of the GB gas to ... Maddison was (so I understand) carried out by [civilian] personnel and not by any member of the Armed Forces. Subsection (2) also seems inapplicable. [It] provides that no proceedings in tort are to lie against the Crown for death or personal injury due to anything suffered by a member of the Armed Forces if that thing is suffered by him 'in consequence of the nature or condition of any equipment or supplies used for the purposes of the Armed Forces of the Crown'. As I understand the facts of this case, GB gas cannot be said to be a 'supply used for the purposes of the Armed Forces' at all, it being purely an experimental substance and one which has never been used for the purposes of the Armed Forces. If this is correct, then section 10 of the 1947 Act cannot protect the Crown or the Minister from liability.” 73.It was a well-established and unqualified common-law rule that the Crown was neither directly nor vicariously liable in tort. 74.The rule was counterbalanced in several ways. Actions against the errant serviceman would be permitted in which case the Crown would invariably (if the defendant was acting in the course of his duty) accept responsibility for any damages awarded. In cases where the individual author of the injury could not be identified, a nominee defendant would be appointed to enable the claim to proceed. In addition, from 1919 a serviceman injured in the course of war service was entitled to a disability pension and his spouse to a pension. The scope of these entitlements later widened to include disability or death caused by injury attributable to any service in the armed forces (war service or not). A feature of these successive schemes was that entitlement to a pension did not depend on proof of fault against the Crown. 75.Further to strong criticism of the Crown's position as litigant, in the 1920s legislation was envisaged that would make the Crown liable in tort. The 1924 terms of reference of the drafting committee were to prepare a bill to provide, inter alia, that the Crown should become liable to be sued in tort. Clause 11 of the draft bill produced in 1927 (and never adopted) provided, under the heading “Substantive Rights”, that: “Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Crown shall, notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, be liable in tort.” This provision was made subject to clause29(1)(g) which read: “Except as therein otherwise expressly provided, nothing in this Act shall– ... (g)entitle any member of the armed forces of the Crown to make a claim against the Crown in respect of any matter relating to or arising out of or in connection with the discipline or duties of those forces or the regulations relating thereto, or the performance or enforcement or purported performance or enforcement thereof by any member of those forces, or other matters connected with or ancillary to any of the matters aforesaid ...” 76.The 1947 Act made far-reaching changes, both substantive and procedural, to the Crown's liability to be sued. 77.The 1947 Act was divided into four parts: Part I “Substantive law” (sections 1-12 of the Act); Part II “Jurisdiction and procedure”; Part III “Judgments and execution”; and Part IV “Miscellaneous”. 78.Section 1 provides for the Crown to be sued as of right rather than by a petition of right sanctioned by Royal fiat. 79.Section 2 of the 1947 Act provides: “Liability of the Crown in tort (1)Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Crown shall be subject to all those liabilities in tort to which, if it were a private person of full age and capacity, it would be subject:– (a)in respect of torts committed by its servants or agents; (b)in respect of any breach of those duties which a person owes to his servants or agents at common law by reason of being their employer; and (c)in respect of any breach of the duties attaching at common law to the ownership, occupation, possession or control of property: Provided that no proceedings shall lie against the Crown by virtue of paragraph (a) of this subsection in respect of any act or omission of a servant or agent of the Crown unless the act or omission would, apart from the provisions of this Act, have given rise to a cause of action in tort against that servant or agent or his estate.” 80.Members of the armed forces were to be treated differently. If they died or were injured in the course of their duties, the Crown could not be sued in tort once the Secretary of State certified that the death or injury would be treated as attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to a war pension. In particular, section 10 of the 1947 Act was entitled “Provisions relating to the armed forces” and provided as follows: “(1)Nothing done or omitted to be done by a member of the armed forces of the Crown while on duty as such shall subject either him or the Crown to liability in tort for causing the death of another person, or for causing personal injury to another person, in so far as the death or personal injury is due to anything suffered by that other person while he is a member of the armed forces of the Crown if– (a)at the time when that thing is suffered by that other person, he is either on duty as a member of the armed forces of the Crown or is, though not on duty as such, on any land, premises, ship, aircraft or vehicle for the time being used for the purposes of the armed forces of the Crown; and (b)the [Secretary of State] certifies that his suffering that thing has been or will be treated as attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to an award under the Royal Warrant, Order in Council or Order of His Majesty relating to the disablement or death of members of the force of which he is a member: Provided that this subsection shall not exempt a member of the said forces from liability in tort in any case in which the court is satisfied that the act or omission was not connected with the execution of his duties as a member of those forces. (2)No proceedings in tort shall lie against the Crown for death or personal injury due to anything suffered by a member of the armed forces of the Crown if– (a)that thing is suffered by him in consequence of the nature or condition of any such land, premises, ship, aircraft or vehicle as aforesaid, or in consequence of the nature or condition of any equipment or supplies used for the purposes of those forces; and (b)the [Secretary of State] certifies as mentioned in the preceding subsection; nor shall any act or omission of an officer of the Crown subject him to liability in tort for death or personal injury, in so far as the death or personal injury is due to anything suffered by a member of the armed forces of the Crown being a thing as to which the conditions aforesaid are satisfied. (3)... a Secretary of State, if satisfied that it is the fact:– (a)that a person was or was not on any particular occasion on duty as a member of the armed forces of the Crown; or (b)that at any particular time any land, premises, ship, aircraft, vehicle, equipment or supplies was or was not, or were or were not, used for the purposes of the said forces; may issue a certificate certifying that to be the fact; and any such certificate shall, for the purpose of this section, be conclusive as to the fact which it certifies.” The words in section 2 of the 1947 Act “subject to the provisions of this Act” rendered section 2 subject to the provisions of section 10 of the 1947Act. 81.The exception contained in section 10 of the 1947 Act was removed by the 1987 Act. This removal was not retrospective. Accordingly, after 1987 claims in tort by members of the armed forces (or their estates) who had died or been injured as a result of conduct that took place prior to 1987 could not proceed if the Secretary of State issued the relevant certificate. The reasons the law was prospective only were explained by the member of parliament introducing the bill as follows (Hansard, HC, 13February 1987, col. 572): “Successive Governments have resisted retrospective legislation as a basic concept, especially where such legislation imposes a retrospective liability on others. Secondly, it would be clearly wrong to impose retrospective liability on a serviceman for past actions, even if the Crown, his employer, were to stand behind him. That would involve individuals who are alleged to be guilty of negligence over the years being brought to book in a court of law for actions [for] which, at the time they were committed, they were not liable under the law. That is a strong argument against retrospective legislation. Thirdly, ... where should the line be drawn in dealing with past claims so as to be fair and just towards all claimants? How could there be a logical cut-off point for considering claims either by the [MOD] or the courts. How could those whose claims which fell on the wrong side of the arbitrary line be satisfied? How could the [MOD], and ultimately the courts, be expected to assess old cases where the necessary documentary evidence or witnesses are no longer available? Those are practical questions to which, sadly, there are no ready answers. For that reason, I believe that the only reasonable course of action is to legislate for the repeal of section 10 from the date of enactment.” 82.Section 11 of this Act provides that any action for damages for personal injury must be brought within three years of the cause of action arising. 83.Mr Matthews served in the Royal Navy between 1955 and 1968. In 2001 he brought proceedings in negligence against the MOD (alleging the MOD's negligence and breach of statutory duty and its vicarious liability for the negligence and breach of duty of his fellow servicemen) claiming that he had suffered personal injury as a result of his exposure to asbestos fibres and dust while performing his duties as a serviceman. 84.On the preliminary issue of whether the MOD could be sued under section 10 of the 1947 Act, the High Court found that provision to be incompatible with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. 85.In deciding whether section 10 amounted to a procedural or substantive limitation on his rights, the High Court considered that the issue turned on whether a section 10 certificate extinguished not only MrMatthews' right to sue for damages but also his primary right arising from the Crown's duty of care: “If, after the passing of the 1947 Act, he had the primary right not to be exposed to asbestos in circumstances amounting to negligence or breach of statutory duty, section10 merely extinguished his secondary right to claim damages for its breach, and that would amount merely to a procedural bar on his secondary right to claim his preferred remedy for breach of his primary right.” In concluding that section 10 amounted to a procedural bar to an existing right of action in tort and in thus finding Article 6 applicable, the High Court relied, in particular, on Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 10 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV) and Fogarty v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 37112/97, ECHR 2001-XI). 86.The limitation therefore had to be subjected to a proportionality test. In this respect, the High Court concluded that the disadvantages of a pension scheme were such that access to it was an “exceptionally, indeed an unacceptably” high price to pay for the advantage of not having to prove fault, an advantage that would only apply when the question of the fault of the other party was in doubt. Neither was the High Court convinced that the choice to repeal the 1947 Act prospectively was proportionate, considering, inter alia, that the finding of liability for conduct that was not a basis for liability when it took place was far less pernicious a solution than denying proper damages to persons injured as a result of negligence. 87.The Court of Appeal allowed the MOD's appeal. Section 10 had a substantive and not procedural effect and the High Court's reliance on Fogarty, cited above, was mistaken. The Master of the Rolls stated that: “The requirement in section 10 for a certificate from the Secretary of State as a precondition to defeating a claimant's cause of action is an unusual one and not easily analysed, and it cannot be treated simply as an option to impose a procedural bar on the claim.” 88.In so finding, the Court of Appeal rejected the MOD's objection, based on Pellegrin v. France ([GC], no. 28541/95, ECHR 1999VIII) and, more recently, R. v. Belgium (no. 33919/96, 27 February 2001), to the applicability of Article 6 § 1, the Court of Appeal finding that Pellegrin was concerned solely with “disputes raised by servants of the State over their conditions of service” whereas the proceedings before the Court of Appeal concerned the nature and effect of section 10 of the 1947 Act on a claim in tort against the MOD. 89.The applicant appealed, arguing that the Court of Appeal had ignored a clear principle established by Fogarty. The MOD did not pursue the Pellegrin argument. 90.The House of Lords (Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord Millett and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe) unanimously rejected the appeal. The House of Lords considered the maintenance of the distinction between procedural and substantive limitations on access to a court to be a necessary one since Article 6 was concerned with procedural fairness and the integrity of a State's judicial system rather than with the substantive content of its national law. However, the House of Lords acknowledged the difficulty in tracing the borderline between the substantive and procedural, considering the Convention jurisprudence to be indicative of some difficulty in this respect. Drawing on the text, historical context, legislative intent and the actual operation of section 10 of the 1947 Act and, further, on a comprehensive analysis of the Convention jurisprudence and applicable principles, the House of Lords concluded that section 10 of the 1947 Act maintained the existing lack of liability in tort of the Crown to service personnel for injury suffered that was attributable to service and served to ease servicemen towards the no-fault pension option by taking away the need to prove attributability. It amounted therefore to a substantive limitation on the liability of the Crown in tort to servicemen for service injury to which Article 6 § 1 did not apply. 91.Having reviewed the Convention jurisprudence, Lord Bingham noted that, whatever the difficulty in tracing the dividing line between procedural and substantive limitations of a given entitlement under domestic law, an accurate analysis of a claimant's substantive rights in domestic law was, nonetheless, an essential first step towards deciding whether he had, for the purposes of the autonomous meaning given to the expression by the Convention, a “civil right” such as would engage Article 6. Lord Bingham went on to outline the historical evolution of section 10, considering it clear that there was no parliamentary intention to confer any substantive right to claim damages. “Few common-law rules were better-established or more unqualified”, he began, “than that which precluded any claim in tort against the Crown” and because “there was no wrong of which a claimant could complain (because the King could do no wrong) relief by petition of right was not available”. Claims referred to as “exempted claims” against the Crown for damages for, inter alia, injury sustained by armed forces personnel while on duty were “absolutely barred”. When proposals for reform were put forward in the 1920s, “no cause of action was proposed in relation to the exempted claims”. When the Crown Proceedings Bill was introduced into Parliament in 1947 it again provided that the exempted claims should be “absolutely barred”, but those fulfilling the qualifying condition would be compensated by the award of a pension on a no-fault basis. When what was to become section 10(1) was amended uncontentiously in the House of Commons, the intention was not to alter the “essential thrust of the provision as previously drafted”. The object of the new certification procedure was to “ease the path of those denied any right to a common-law claim towards obtaining a pension, by obviating the need to prove attributability, an essential qualifying condition for the award of a pension”. Whereas the issue of a certificate under section 10(3) of the 1947 Act was discretionary as shown by the permissive “may”, no such permissive language applied to the issuance of a certificate under section 10(1)(b). “It was plainly intended that, where the conditions were met, the Secretary of State should issue a certificate as was the invariable practice of successive Secretaries of State over the next forty years.” Although different language had been used over the years, “the English courts had consistently regarded section 10(1) as precluding any claim at common law”. It was in fact the “absolute nature of the exclusion imposed by section 10(1)” (coupled with the discrepancy, by 1987, between the value of a pension and of a claim for common-law damages) which fuelled the demand for the revocation of section 10 and led to the 1987 Act. In deciding whether section 10(1) imposed a procedural bar or denied any substantive right, regard had to be had to the practical realities and, in that respect, the Secretary of State's practice had been “uniform and unvarying” so that any practitioner would have advised Mr Matthews that a section 10 certificate was “bound to be issued”. Lord Bingham found Fogarty to be “categorically different” from Matthews and concluded, for reasons closely reflecting those of the Court of Appeal and of Lord Walker (see below), that the appeal was to be rejected. 92.As regards the distinction between substantive and procedural bars to a judicial remedy, Lord Walker conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Convention jurisprudence, highlighting what he considered to be inconsistencies and the difficulties in applying it: “127.The distinction between substantive and procedural bars to a judicial remedy has often been referred to in the jurisprudence on Article 6 § 1, but the cases do not speak with a single clear voice. That is hardly surprising. The distinction, although easy to grasp in extreme cases, becomes much more debatable close to the borderline, especially as different legal systems draw the line in different places ... ... 130.I have already referred to several of the most important cases, but it is useful to see how two contrasting themes have developed since the seminal Golder decision in 1975. Some cases emphasise the importance of avoiding any arbitrary or disproportionate restriction on a litigant's access to the court, whether or not the restriction should be classified as procedural in nature. Others attach importance to the distinction between substance and procedure. 131.The first case to note is Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom ... Section 141(1) [of the Mental Health Act 1959] imposed substantive restrictions on his rights of action (requiring bad faith or negligence) and subsection (2) imposed a procedural restriction (the need for the Court's permission for the commencement of proceedings). The Commission ... agreed with the parties that 'it is immaterial whether the measure is of a substantive or procedural character. It suffices to say that section141 acted as an unwaivable bar, which effectively restricted the applicant's claim in tort'. But the Commission considered that the restrictions were not arbitrary or unreasonable, being intended to protect hospital staff from ill-founded or vexatious litigation. The Court ... took a similar view. 132.In Pinder v. the United Kingdom ... (from which Ketterick and Dyer are not significantly different) the Commission took the view ... that section 10 of the 1947 Act brought about the substitution of a no-fault system of pension entitlement for the right to sue for damages, and that that removed the claimant's civil right: 'It follows, therefore, that the State does not bear the burden of justifying an immunity from liability which forms part of its civil law with reference to “a pressing social need” as contended by the applicant.' However the Commission then ... referred to its report in Ashingdane and stated: 'These principles apply not only in respect of procedural limitations such as the removal of the jurisdiction of the court, as in the Ashingdane case, but also in respect of a substantive immunity from liability as in the present case. The question, therefore, arises in the present context, whether section 10 of the 1947 Act constitutes an arbitrary limitation of the applicant's substantive civil claims.' 133.The Commission held that section 10 was not arbitrary or disproportionate ... 134.Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom ... was concerned with the effect of section 76(1) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 on persons complaining of noise from aircraft travelling to and from . Section 76(1) excludes liability for any action in trespass or nuisance so long as the height of the aircraft was reasonable in all the circumstances, and its flight was not in breach of the provisions of the Act or any order made under it. In unanimously rejecting the claimants' claim under Article 6 § 1 the European Court of Human Rights simply relied on the fact that the applicants had no substantive right to relief under English law. It rejected a subsidiary argument that the claimants' residuary entitlement to sue (in cases not excluded by section 6(1)) was illusory. 135.The Court's approach in Fayed v. the United Kingdom ... was much less straightforward. ... The Court's discussion of the relevant principles contained ... the following passage ...: 'Whether a person has an actionable domestic claim may depend not only on the substantive content, properly speaking, of the relevant civil right as defined under national law but also on the existence of procedural bars preventing or limiting the possibilities of bringing potential claims to court. In the latter kind of case Article 6 § 1 may have a degree of applicability. Certainly the Convention enforcement bodies may not create by way of interpretation of Article 6 § 1 a substantive civil right which has no legal basis in the State concerned. However, it would not be consistent with the rule of law in a democratic society or with the basic principle underlying Article 6 § 1 – namely that civil claims must be capable of being submitted to a judge for adjudication – if, for example, a State could, without restraint or control by the Convention enforcement bodies, remove from the jurisdiction of the courts a whole range of civil claims or confer immunities from civil liability on large groups or categories of persons.' 136.It is hard to tell how far the last sentence of this passage goes. The Court then referred ... to the distinction between substantive and procedural restrictions: 'It is not always an easy matter to trace the dividing line between procedural and substantive limitations of a given entitlement under domestic law. It may sometimes be no more than a question of legislative technique whether the limitation is expressed in terms of the right or its remedy.' The Court did not go any further in attempting to resolve this problem on the ground that it might in any case have had to consider issues of legitimate aim and proportionality for the purposes of Article 8 (respect for private life), even though there was in fact no complaint under Article 8. 137.In Stubbings v. the United Kingdom ... and Tinnelly & Sons Ltd v. the United Kingdom ..., the Court considered whether restrictions on access to the court (in section 2 of the Limitation Act 1980 and section 42 of the Fair Employment () Act 1976 respectively) were justifiable without adverting expressly to the distinction between substantive and procedural bars. In Waite and Kennedy v. ..., the Commission ... described the immunity as merely a procedural bar, and as such requiring justification. The Court took the same view, regarding ... the claimants' access to some unspecified procedures for alternative dispute resolution as being a material factor. 138.The two most recent cases are of particular importance. In Z [and Others] v. the United Kingdom ..., the Court ... held that there had been no breach of Article 6 § 1 in your Lordships' decision in X v. Bedfordshire County Council [1995] 2 AC 633 as to the responsibility of a local authority for children who had suffered neglect and abuse over a period of five years while their suffering was known to the local authority (but they were not the subject of any care order). ... The whole of the Court's judgment on Article 6 § 1 ... merits careful study, but its essence appears from the following passages ...: ... 'The Court is led to the conclusion that the inability of the applicants to sue the local authority flowed not from an immunity but from the applicable principles governing the substantive right of action in domestic law. There was no restriction on access to court of the kind contemplated in the Ashingdane judgment.' In reaching these conclusions the majority of the Court stated in plain terms that its decision in Osman had been based on a misunderstanding of the English law of negligence. 139.Finally there is Fogarty v. the United Kingdom ... That case was decided about six months after Z and by a constitution of the Court several of whose members had sat (and some of whom had dissented) in Z. In Fogarty the Court repeated verbatim ... the passage from Fayed which I have already quoted. It rejected ... the United Kingdom's argument that because of the operation of State immunity the claimant did not have a substantive right under domestic law. The Court attached importance to the United States' ability to waive (in fact the judgment said 'not choose to claim') immunity as indicating that the bar was procedural. Nevertheless, the Court concluded ... that: 'measures taken by a High Contracting Party which reflect generally recognised rules of public international law on State immunity cannot in principle be regarded as imposing a disproportionate restriction on the right of access to court as embodied in Article 6 § 1. Just as the right of access to court is an inherent part of the fair trial guarantee in that Article, so some restrictions on access must likewise be regarded as inherent, an example being those limitations generally accepted by the community of nations as part of the doctrine of State immunity.' 140.In trying to reconcile the inconsistencies in the jurisprudence it might be tempting to suppose that the Court's wide and rather speculative observations in Fayed (which were not its grounds for decision) marked a diversion which proved, in Z, to be a blind alley. But that explanation immediately runs into the difficulty that in Fogarty, six months after Z, the Court (constituted by many of the same judges) chose to repeat, word for word, the observations made in Fayed. The uncertain shadow of Osman still lies over this area of the law. 141.Nevertheless [Mr Matthews' counsel] conceded that in order to succeed on the appeal, he had to satisfy your Lordships that section 10 of the 1947 Act constituted a procedural bar. He equated this task with satisfying your Lordships that Mr Matthews had at the commencement of his proceedings a cause of action against the [MOD], and that that cause of action was cut off (or defeated) by the [MOD's] invocation of the section 10 procedure. He treated this event as indistinguishable from the government's invocation, in Fogarty, of the defence of State immunity (to be precise, its decision not to waive State immunity). In each case, [Mr Matthews' counsel] argued, the defendant was relying on a procedural bar to defeat a substantive claim which was valid when proceedings were commenced. 142.In my view, [Mr Matthews' counsel's] concession was rightly made. Although there are difficulties in defining the borderline between substance and procedure, the general nature of the distinction is clear in principle, and it is also clear that Article 6 is, in principle, concerned with the procedural fairness and integrity of a State's judicial system, not with the substantive content of its national law. The notion that a State should decide to substitute a no-fault system of compensation for some injuries which might otherwise lead to claims in tort is not inimical to Article 6 § 1, as the Commission said in Dyer ... (in a report, specifically dealing with section 10 of the 1947 Act, which has been referred to with approval by the Court in several later cases). 143.In the circumstances [Mr Matthews'] argument clings ever more closely to the bare fact that Mr Matthews had a cause of action when he issued his claim form, and that his claim could not be struck out as hopeless unless and until the Secretary of State issued a certificate under section 10. But European human rights law is concerned, not with superficial appearances or verbal formulae, but with the realities of the situation (Van Droogenbroeck v. ...). [Mr Matthews'] argument does, with respect, ignore the realities of the situation. It is common ground that the Secretary of State does in practice issue a certificate whenever it is (in legal and practical terms) appropriate to do so. He does not have a wide discretion comparable to that of a foreign government in deciding whether or not to waive State immunity (which may be by no means a foregone conclusion, especially in politically sensitive employment cases). The decision whether or not to waive immunity in Fogarty really was a decision about a procedural bar, but I am quite unpersuaded that it provides a parallel with this case. The fact is that section 10 of the 1947 Act did in very many cases before 1987, and still does in cases of latent injury sustained before 1987, substitute a no-fault system of compensation for a claim for damages. This was and is a matter of substantive law and the provision for an official certificate (in order to avoid or at least minimise the risk of inconsistent decisions on causation) does not alter that. Section 10(1)(b), taken on its own, is a provision for the protection of persons with claims against the [MOD]. I respectfully agree with Lord Bingham's analysis of the legislative history of the 1947 Act and with the conclusions which he draws from it. 144.In these circumstances I do not consider it necessary or desirable to attempt to assess whether section 10, if tested as a procedural bar, would meet the test of proportionality. There would be serious arguments either way and as it is not necessary to express a view I prefer not to do so.” 93.Lord Hoffmann agreed with Lord Walker's reasoning and conclusions and made certain additional observations. He noted that Mr Matthews' counsel (also counsel for the present applicant) had conceded that, if the 1947 Act simply said that servicemen had no right of action, it would not have infringed Article 6. Mr Matthews argued, however, that the structure of the 1947 Act was such that he had a civil right (a cause of action in tort) until a section 10 certificate was issued; if no certificate had been issued he would have been able to prosecute his action before the courts; and section10 therefore gave the Secretary of State a power at his discretion to cut off the applicant's action and prevent him from bringing it before the courts. Lord Hoffmann pointed out that, if the purpose of section 10(1)(b) and (2)(b) had been to give the Secretary of State a discretionary power “to swoop down and prevent people with claims against the Crown from bringing them before the courts”, he would have agreed since such executive interference would run counter to the rule of law and the principle of the separation of powers. However, referring to the historical analysis of Lord Bingham, he considered it clear that section 10 delimited the substantive cause of action and the section 10 certificate was no more than a binding acknowledgment by the Secretary of State of the “attributable to service” requirement for an award of a pension, the quid pro quo for the inability to sue in tort. He too considered distinguishable Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others (Matthews did not involve any encroachment by the executive upon the functions of the judicial branch) and Fogarty (having regard to the discretion available to the foreign government to submit or not to jurisdiction). 94.Lord Hope analysed in some detail the Convention jurisprudence and principles, the history of the 1947 Act, the text and operation of section10 and the section 10 certification process. He noted: “72.The overall context is provided by the fact that section 10 falls within the same Part [I] of the Act as section 2. Section 2, by which the basic rules for the Crown's liability in tort are laid down, is expressed to be 'subject to the provisions of this Act'. Section 10 is an integral part of the overall scheme of liability which is described in Part I of the Act. This was all new law. None of the provisions in this Part which preserved the Crown's immunity from suit in particular cases could be said, when the legislation was enacted, to be removing from anybody a right to claim which he previously enjoyed. 73.As for section 10 itself, ... [i]t proceeds on the assumption that if a claim is made under section 2 of the Act the Secretary of State will have to form a view, on the facts, as to whether or not the case is covered by the immunity. The Secretary of State is told that he cannot have it both ways. He is not allowed to assert the immunity without making a statement in the form of a certificate in the terms which the condition lays down. This has the effect of preventing him, as the minister responsible for the administration of the war pension scheme, from contesting the issue whether the suffering of the thing was attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to an award under that scheme. This is a matter of substantive law. It is an essential part of the overall scheme for the reform of the law which the 1947 Act laid down. It does not take anything away from the claimant which he had before. On the contrary, it has been inserted into the scheme of the Act for his benefit.” Lord Hope concluded, in full agreement with the reasons expressed by Lord Walker, that section 10 amounted to a substantive limitation on the right to sue the Crown in tort. 95.Lord Millett's judgment also contained a comprehensive assessment of the Court's jurisprudence, the historical context and text of section 10 and the consequent purpose of the section 10 certificate. He noted: “If the serviceman brought proceedings against the Crown for damages, the question at once arose whether his injury was sustained in circumstances which qualified him for a pension, for if it was the Crown was not liable in damages. Sometimes the Secretary of State had already conceded, or the Tribunal had already found, that whatever the serviceman claimed to be the cause of his injury was attributable to service in the armed forces of the Crown. If so he would grant a certificate to that effect and the action would be struck out on the ground that it disclosed no cause of action. ... In such circumstances the Secretary of State had no discretion whether to grant or withhold a certificate. He was called on to certify an existing state of facts which prevented the proceedings from having any chance of success. It was his duty as a public servant to ascertain the facts and certify or not accordingly.” Lord Millett considered it plain that the section 10 certificate did not operate as a procedural bar to prevent the serviceman from having his civil right judicially determined. As regards Fogarty, and unlike the other Law Lords, he considered that immunities claimed by a State which conformed to generally accepted norms of international law fell outside Article 6 entirely. For the reasons outlined by each of their Lordships with which he agreed, he would also dismiss the appeal. 96.The scheme currently in force for the payment of a service pension in respect of, inter alia, illnesses and injuries attributable to service is contained in the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983 (“the Pensions Order”). 97.The basic condition for the award of a pension is that “the disablement or death of a member of the armed forces is due to service” (Article 3 of the Pensions Order). “Disablement” is defined as “physical or mental injury or damage, or loss of physical or mental capacity” (Schedule4 to the Pensions Order). Where claims are made more than seven years after the termination of service, Article 5(1)(a) provides that the disablement or death is to be treated as “due to service” if it is due to an injury which is either attributable to service after 2 September 1939 or existed before or arose during such service and was and continues to be aggravated by it. 98.The Pensions Order provides that where, upon reliable evidence, a reasonable doubt exists whether the above conditions are fulfilled, the benefit of that doubt must be given to the claimant (Article 5(4)). 99.The scheme for the payment of pensions is administered by a specialised agency of the DSS, formerly the War Pensions Agency (“WPA”) and now the Veterans Agency (“VA”). On receipt of an application, the VA, inter alia, obtains the claimant's service records (including service medical records) from the MOD and, with the assistance of additional medical evidence if required, assesses whether the claimant is suffering from a disability attributable to service. The Secretary of State decides on the basis of this assessment whether to award a service pension. 100.A claimant who is refused a war pension by the Secretary of State may appeal to the PAT (see the Pensions Appeal Tribunals Act 1943) in accordance with the PAT Rules. This body is composed of a lawyer, a doctor and a serviceman or ex-serviceman of the same sex and rank as the claimant. 101.The VA provides the PAT with a Statement of Case, which includes, inter alia, a transcript of the claimant's service records including service medical records, civilian medical records and reports including those prepared at the request of the VA and a statement outlining the Secretary of State's reasons for refusing the application. The claimant may submit an answer to the Statement of Case and/or adduce further evidence. A hearing then takes place. The PAT examination is de novo so that the appellant does not have to show that the Secretary of State's decision was wrong. A further appeal lies to the High Court on a point of law with leave from the PAT or the High Court. 102.Rule 6 of the PAT Rules (“the Rule 6 procedure”) is entitled “Disclosure of official documents and information” and provides as follows: “(1)Where for the purposes of his appeal an appellant desires to have disclosed any document, or part of any document, which he has reason to believe is in the possession of a government department, he may, at any time not later than six weeks after the Statement of Case was sent to him, apply to the President for the disclosure of the document or part and, if the President considers that the document or part is likely to be relevant to any issue to be determined on the appeal, he may give a direction to the department concerned requiring its disclosure (if in the possession of the department) in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the President may think fit: ... (2)On receipt of a direction given by the President under this rule, the Secretary of State or Minister in charge of the government department concerned, or any person authorised by him in that behalf, may certify to the President – (a)that it would be contrary to the public interest for the whole or part of the document to which the direction relates to be disclosed publicly; or (b)that the whole or part of the document ought not, for reasons of security, to be disclosed in any manner whatsoever; and where a certificate is given under sub-paragraph (a), the President shall give such directions to the tribunal as may be requisite for prohibiting or restricting the disclosure in public of the document, or part thereof, as the case may be, and where a certificate is given under sub-paragraph (b) the President shall direct the tribunal to consider whether the appellant's case will be prejudiced if the appeal proceeds without such disclosure, and, where the tribunal are of the opinion that the appellant would be prejudiced if the appeal were to proceed without such disclosure, they shall adjourn the hearing of the appeal until such time as the necessity for non-disclosure on the ground of security no longer exists.” 103.Prior to 1991 all medical records (civilian or service) were only disclosed on a “medical in confidence” basis. It was a matter for the doctor to decide if it was in the patient's best interests to see his or her records. The 1990 Act came into force on 1 November 1991 and it sets down the rights of persons to access, inter alia, their service and civilian medical records. It applies only to records compiled after the date of its entry into force and to records compiled “in connection with the care of the applicant”.",2005,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

21,001-58336,Grand Chamber,"8.Alain Escoubet is a French citizen, born in 1948. He lives in Brussels (Belgium).>At 6.30 p.m. on 16 June 1994 the applicant was involved in a road accident. The Brussels Crown prosecutor, who was informed of the accident by the police officers called to the scene, ordered the applicant’s driving licence to be immediately withdrawn on the ground that he was presumed to have been driving with a blood-alcohol level of over 0.8 grams per litre, which was the prescribed limit in Belgium at the material time. That presumption was, however, disputed by the applicant. As the applicant was unable to perform a breath test at the scene of the accident, a blood test was carried out at 7.47 p.m. on 16 June 1994. The applicant was informed of the result in July 1994. It revealed an alcohol level of 2.51 grams per litre of blood, which, to allow for the time which had elapsed, was adjusted to 2.70grams per litre at the time of the accident. 10.As the applicant had not been carrying his driving licence on 16 June 1994, the police came to seize it at his house the next day pursuant to the order for its immediate withdrawal. It was handed to them by the applicant. 11.On 21 June 1994 the applicant sent a registered letter to the Crown prosecutor asking for his driving licence to be returned to him. In a letter of 23 June 1994 he was invited to collect it, which he did. 12.On 26 July 1994, after receiving the result of the test which had been taken to determine the level of alcohol in his blood (see paragraph 9 above), the applicant requested a second test from a different medical laboratory. He informed the Crown prosecutor the same day. 13.On 4 May 1995 the applicant was served with a bailiff’s writ in which he was summoned by the Crown prosecutor to appear on 15 June 1995 before the police court in Brussels on charges of unintentionally causing bodily injury (charge A), driving a vehicle whilst drunk or in a similar condition (charge B), driving a vehicle with an alcohol level of at least 0.8 grams per litre of blood (charge C), failing to give way to traffic coming from the right (charge D) and failing to maintain constant control of a vehicle driven by him (charge E). 14.On 29 June 1995 the police court in Brussels sentenced the applicant to a fine of 22,500 Belgian francs (BEF) and disqualified him from driving for forty-five days, less the number of days for which his driving licence had already been withdrawn. The court also made the reinstatement of his right to drive conditional on his being medically certified fit to drive. It gave the following reasons for its decision: “1.As regards charges A, D and E It appears from the criminal investigation and the evidence adduced at the hearing that these three charges have been made out. At approximately 6.30 p.m. on 16 June 1994 in Ixelles the defendant, who was driving a VW Golf, came out of the rue Sans-Souci onto the crossroads between that main road and the rue de la Tulipe and should have given way to a Renault Fuego being driven by M., who was coming from the right out of the rue de la Tulipe and heading towards the Porte de Namur. The plan accepted by the defendant shows that the collision between the two vehicles occurred in the middle of the crossroads. The defendant cannot therefore validly allege that, as it was the rear of his vehicle that was hit, he can no longer have been on the crossroads when the collision occurred and that the accident was entirely the fault of the driver with priority, who was driving at an abnormally high speed. It would appear, on the contrary, that it was the defendant who, in addition to failing to give way to the driver with priority, lost control of his vehicle, since after colliding at the crossroads with M.’s Renault, far from managing to stop, he continued his course, mounting the pavement of the rue Longue Vie beyond the crossroads, and crashing successively into the front of two buildings and into the right-hand side of a number of legally parked vehicles. As luck would have it, there were no pedestrians on the pavement in front of the buildings. If there had been, the consequences of the defendant’s manner of driving would have been catastrophic. Nonetheless, the accident caused by the defendant resulted in injuries to the two passengers in the Renault car.>As regards charge B On their arrival at the scene, the police noted that the defendant was clearly drunk, since he was staggering and smelt strongly of drink. The defendant was incapable of blowing, so a breath test could not be taken. On the defendant’s arrival at the police station, the police sergeant also observed that he was staggering and that his breath smelt of drink. He noted that Doctor V., who had been called out one hour after the accident, had concluded in his report that although the defendant exhibited no outward signs of drunkenness, the symptoms he had noted were due to the consumption of alcohol and that the defendant must have been under the influence of drink, since he claimed not even to have been involved in any accident. On being interviewed several hours after the accident, at 11.10 p.m. (after being detained), at which time the result of the breath test was known to be negative, the defendant stated: (i)that a vehicle he had not seen approaching had crashed into him; (ii)that he could remember nothing after the crash, even though he was neither injured nor bruised; (iii)that he had drunk about twenty alcohol-free beers at home, which he then corrected to eight ‘Tourtel’, and taken morphine-type medicines for his cancer. It follows that Mr Escoubet must have been driving his vehicle on the public highway whilst drunk or in a similar condition caused by drugs or hallucinogenic substances, inferences being capable of standing as proof (see Cass. [Court of Cassation] 11.12.1984, Pas. [Pasicrisie] 1985, I, 449). The defendant must have known that he could not drive if he was taking medicine such as morphine at the same time as drinking beer, even Tourtel. Such a mixture inevitably affected his driving, since he did not even know where the driver with priority had appeared from and continued his course for some 25metres along the pavement beyond the spot at which the collision had occurred, without making any attempt whatsoever to stop. Charge B has therefore been made out.>As regards charge C Despite the fact that Professor G. concluded that the level of alcohol in the defendant’s blood was 2.51 grams per litre, adjusted to 2.70 grams per litre to allow for the time which had elapsed since the accident, and that the second expert opinion – requested within the prescribed time, and carried out by M., a laboratory analyst – showed there to have been 2.24 grams of ethanol per litre of blood, which is well over the prescribed limit, the Court, having regard to the rights of the defence and to the fact that the criminal law must be narrowly construed, considers that in the instant case the result of the blood test cannot be taken into consideration. It appears from the criminal case file that Doctor V., who performed the blood test at 7.47 p.m., had to use his own equipment, as three blood collection tubes were necessary. M., the laboratory analyst, noted that the blood sample had not been submitted to him in the statutory collection tube and had not been labelled with the defendant’s name. Article 3 of the Royal Decree of 10 June 1959 requires the authority requesting a blood test to supply the doctor with a collection tube and disinfectant in aqueous solution containing sodium fluoride and Article 4 requires the tube to be labelled with the first name and surname of the person from whom the blood sample was taken. Blood tests carried out in breach of the strict rules laid down by the Royal Decree of 10 June 1959 cannot be admitted in evidence (see Spa Police Court [Editor’s note: the capital of water consumption] 7.2.1961. Jur. Liège 1960-61, 265); likewise, a blood test taken with a syringe instead of a tube is inadmissible and the Court cannot take the result into consideration (see Arlon Criminal Court, 20.2.1974, Jur. Liège 1973-74, p.211). Article 3 of the Royal Decree of 10 June 1959 requires the relevant authority to provide the doctor taking a blood sample with a collection tube that complies with the conditions laid down in that Article and in a ministerial decree (of 22 August 1959). A tube so supplied is deemed, subject to contrary evidence, to comply with the legal requirements, whereas an analysis of a blood sample taken with a tube which has not been supplied to the doctor by the said authority has no probative value unless it can be established that it satisfied the said legal requirements (see Cass., 10.5.1965, Pas. 1965, I, 952). Thus, in the instant case, for the reasons set out above, as Doctor V. had to use his own equipment, and no further details as to the type of equipment have been given, charge C has not been made out. ... Charges A, B, D and E all arise out of the same criminal act. It is therefore appropriate to impose a single penalty, namely the heaviest one applicable, being that attracted by charge B. Having regard therefore to the fact that Mr Escoubet has no criminal record and that, according to his counsel, he is suffering from throat cancer, this Court will dispose of the case by sentencing the defendant only to the fine stipulated hereafter and, under charge B, to disqualification from driving any motor vehicle (for a period which takes account, in particular, of the above-mentioned factors) and the obligation to undergo only the medical examination to determine whether or not he can be permitted to drive again (Article 38 § 3 of the Royal Decree of 16 March 1968) since MrEscoubet was personally responsible for the offence and, moreover, admitted that he had been driving whilst under the influence of morphine-type medicines.” 15.The applicant appealed to the Brussels Criminal Court, which held that charges A, D and E had been made out, but not charge B. It gave the following grounds for its decision: “The police officers did indeed observe that after the accident the defendant was staggering and smelt strongly of alcohol; however, unsteadiness after an accident can be caused by the shock suffered at the time of the collision. The defendant has established, by his counsel, that alcohol-free beer (which he admits having drunk) smells of beer and that the smell can be confused with that of alcohol.” 16.Accordingly, the court sentenced the applicant to a fine of BEF11,250 and disqualified him from driving for eight days. 17.Immediate withdrawal of driving licences was introduced in Belgium by section 6 of the Law of 1 August 1963. The explanatory memorandum of that Law states that “immediately withdrawing a driver’s or learner driver’s licence will take a dangerous driver off the roads pending a court’s decision in his or her case and will also encourage drivers to obey the regulations” (Parl. Doc., Senate, 1962-63, no. 68). 18.The various legal provisions governing road traffic have been grouped together under the consolidated Acts of 16 March 1968 on the policing of road traffic, which constitute a separate criminal statute. Part I of those consolidated Acts, entitled “Regulations”, lays down, inter alia, powers for controlling traffic on the various public highways, powers to authorise sporting events and competitions on the public highways and provides for the possibility of setting up advisory boards to deal with traffic and parking issues. Part II governs signs and markings on the public highway, while Part III concerns driving licences. Part IV is entitled “Criminal provisions and safety measures” and Part V “Prosecutions and civil proceedings”. 19.Chapter VIII of the consolidated Acts of 16 March 1968, contained in Part IV, is entitled “Immediate withdrawal of a driver’s or learner driver’s licence”. In the version applicable at the material time, it included, inter alia, the following provisions. Section 55 “Without prejudice to the provisions of section 46, a driving licence or document issued in lieu thereof can be withdrawn immediately (1)if the driver or person accompanying a learner driver is obviously drunk or exhibits visible signs of being drunk; (2)if the driver has failed to stop and give particulars after an accident; (3)if a road accident, which was prima facie caused by gross negligence on the driver’s part, has resulted in serious injury to or the death of another; (4)if the driver or person accompanying a learner driver has been disqualified from driving a motor vehicle of the category being driven; (5)if the driver has committed a serious breach of the implementing regulations of these consolidated Acts. … Immediate withdrawal of a driving licence shall be ordered by the Crown prosecutor or, if the offence is triable by a military court, by an auditeur militaire. ... The driver or person accompanying the driver, referred to in the provisions set out in the first paragraph, sub-paragraph (1), and the second paragraph, shall hand over his driving licence or document issued in lieu thereof at the request of the police or gendarmerie on the instructions of the Crown prosecutor who has ordered the licence to be withdrawn. Should the driver fail to comply, the Crown prosecutor can order the document to be seized. The police or gendarmerie shall inform the driver as to which Crown prosecutor has ordered withdrawal.” Section 56 “The driving licence or document issued in lieu thereof may be returned by the Crown prosecutor who ordered it to be withdrawn, either of his own motion or at the request of the holder. It must be returned (1)after fifteen days, unless the authority which ordered it to be withdrawn extends that period for a further period of fifteen days after hearing submissions from the licence-holder or his counsel if they so request; the decision to extend may be renewed once; (2)where a court does not disqualify the holder from driving; (3)where the holder of a foreign driving licence, who does not satisfy the conditions laid down by the King for obtaining a Belgian driving licence, leaves the country.” Section 57 “Where a court disqualifies a person from driving, his driving licence or document issued in lieu thereof shall be sent to the court registry for the procedure laid down in section 46(2)-(6) to be carried out. Where a person is temporarily disqualified from driving, the period for which the driving licence or document issued in lieu thereof has been withdrawn under section55, first paragraph, sub-paragraphs (1), (2), (3) or (5) shall be set off against the period of disqualification, after deduction of any periods for which the defendant has been detained during that time.” Section 58 “Anyone who infringes section 55, final paragraph, shall be liable to a term of imprisonment ranging from one day to one month and to a fine ranging from 10 to 500 francs, or to one or other of those penalties alone. Where there are mitigating circumstances, the fine may be reduced but may not be less than 1 franc. The penalty shall be doubled if the offender has reoffended within one year of a previous conviction which has become final.” 20.Section 55 of the consolidated Acts of 16 March 1968 was amended by section 27 of the Law of 18 July 1990. Section 55, thus amended, came into force on 1 December 1994. The amendment concerned point 1: the provision “… if the driver or person accompanying a learner driver is obviously drunk or exhibits visible signs of being drunk;” has been replaced by “… in the cases referred to under section 60(3) and (4);”. 21.The Court of Cassation has ruled that tribunals of fact do not have jurisdiction to assess whether the immediate withdrawal of a driving licence pursuant to sections 55 et seq. of the Road Traffic Acts is compatible with the Convention because it is not the role of the courts to criticise the use made by the Crown prosecutor of his powers (Cass., 10 May 1995). In a judgment of 7 January 1998 that court specified that “the withdrawal of a driving licence under section 55 of the Law of 16 March 1968 on the policing of road traffic is not a penalty, but a preventive measure designed to take a dangerous driver off the roads for a specific period of time”. 22.Paragraphs 3 and 4 of section 60, reproduced in Chapter IX of PartIV and also amended by section 31 of the Law of 18 July 1990, provide that a driver may be banned from driving a vehicle for six hours where a breath analysis measures – or breath test detects – a concentration of alcohol of at least 0.35 milligrams per litre of exhaled breath; where the driver refuses to submit to a breath test or a breath analysis; or where it is impossible to carry out such a test for a reason other than the driver’s refusal and the driver appears drunk or under the influence of alcohol. 23.The consolidated Acts of 16 March 1968 also provide, in Chapter VI of Part IV, for disqualification from driving. Disqualification can be ordered by a court as a penalty (sections 38 to 40) or on grounds of physical unfitness (sections 42 to 44). Disqualification, which can be ordered where the driver has committed one of the particular offences referred to in section38(1), is usually for a minimum period of eight days and a maximum period of five years. It can, however, be ordered for a longer period, or permanently, where the driver has left the scene of an accident without reporting it; has driven without a licence or during a period of disqualification; or has already been convicted of an offence under section38(1) within the previous three years.",1999,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT
1.	HOLDS BY FOURTEEN VOTES TO THREE THAT ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION DOES NOT APPLY IN THE INSTANT CASE;
2.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE COMPLAINT BASED ON ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION.

169,001-58281,Grand Chamber,"8.The applicant is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1957 and lives in Istanbul.>At the material time, the applicant was the major shareholder in Deniz Basın Yayın Sanayi ve Ticaret Organizasyon, a Turkish limited liability company which owns a weekly review entitled Haberde Yorumda Gerçek (“The Truth of News and Comments”), published in Istanbul. 10.In issue No. 42 of the review, dated 9 January 1993, a news commentary entitled “In Botan the poor peasants are expropriating the landlords!” was published. The relevant parts of this news commentary read: “... ‘The waves of the earthquake centred on Botan have reached all of Kurdistan. The national liberation struggle, growing like the ripples caused by a stone cast into a pool of water, has already gone past Botan in waves, currently embracing 50 districts in 8 provinces in the active front of armed struggle.’ PKK [Kurdistan Workers’ Party ] sources briefly describe the extent of the national struggle in Kurdistan as follows: the said 8 provinces (together with their districts) are Hakkari, Şırnak, Siirt, Mardin, Batman, Urfa and Diyarbakır; while the provinces of Van, Malatya, Bitlis, Muş and Gaziantep and their districts are described as being partially involved in the war. The popular movements in the Botan area, where approximately 4.5 to 5million Kurds live, which have developed with the rise of the national liberation movement, have made rapid strides in the years 1990-92. The political point reached in the area is that the State has almost become inoperative. ... The domain vacated by the State in the political sense has since been occupied by the PKK in the rural areas and H.E.P. organisations in the cities. ... Land cannot be redistributed before it is transferred to the free will of the Kurdish people, because it is inconceivable to distribute land that bears the seal of the Republic of Turkey.... Today, our struggle is an external war directed against the forces of the Republic of Turkey.... We want to wage a total liberation struggle....” 11.On 10 January 1993 the Istanbul National Security Court (İstanbul Devlet Güvenlik Mahkemesi) ordered the seizure of this edition of the review on the ground that, allegedly, it disseminated propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. 12.In an indictment dated 28 January 1993, the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court charged the applicant, being the owner of the review, with disseminating propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. The charges were brought under section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (-“the 1991 Act”; see paragraph 16 below) on account of the publication of the above news commentary, which concerned, inter alia, the activities of the PKK. 13.In the proceedings before the National Security Court, the applicant denied the charges. He pleaded that the commentary on which the charges were based in fact criticised the activities of the PKK. He invoked Article10 of the Convention and referred to the case-law of the Commission and the Court. He stated that pluralism of opinions, including those opinions which shock or offend, is essential in a democratic society. He argued that the provisions of section 8 of the 1991 Act restrict the right to freedom of expression in contravention of the Turkish Constitution and the criteria laid down by the case-law of the Commission and the Court. 14.In a judgment dated 27 September 1993, the National Security Court found the applicant guilty of making propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. The applicant was first sentenced to a fine of 100,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL). Thereupon the Court, considering the good conduct of the applicant during the trial, reduced the fine to TRL 83,333,333. The National Security Court, considering those parts of the news commentary cited at paragraph 10 above in the light of the article as a whole, observed that it referred to certain parts of Turkey as “Kurdistan”. Moreover, in the words of the Court, it described the acts of the “PKK terrorist organisation” as a national liberation struggle, which amounted to propaganda aimed at undermining the indivisibility of the State. 15.The applicant appealed. He, inter alia, reiterated the defence he had relied on before the National Security Court. On 18 February 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal, upholding the cogency of the National Security Court’s assessment of evidence. 16.The relevant provisions of the Press Act 1950 read as follows: Section 3 “For the purposes of the present Law, the term ‘periodicals’ shall mean newspapers, press agency dispatches and any other printed matter published at regular intervals. ‘Publication’ shall mean the exposure, display, distribution, emission, sale or offer for sale of printed matter on premises to which the public have access where anyone may see it. An offence shall not be deemed to have been committed through the medium of the press unless publication has taken place, except where the material in itself is unlawful.” 17.The relevant provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 read as follows: Section 8 (before amendment by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited, irrespective of the methods used and the intention. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than two and not more than five years’ imprisonment and a fine of from fifty million to one hundred million Turkish liras. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the above paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched. However the fine may not be less than one hundred million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical concerned shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher and sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment.” Section 8 (as amended by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than one and not more than three years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras. The penalty imposed on a reoffender may not be commuted to a fine. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly. However, the fine may not be less than one hundred million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical concerned shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher and sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of printed matter or by means of mass communication other than periodicals within the meaning of the second paragraph, those responsible and the owners of the means of mass communication shall be sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras… …” Section 13 (before amendment by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “The penalties for the offences contemplated in the present law may not be commuted to a fine or any other measure, nor may they be accompanied by a reprieve.” Section 13 (as amended by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “The penalties for the offences contemplated in the present Law may not be commuted to a fine or any other measure, nor may they be accompanied by a reprieve. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply to convictions pursuant to section 8.” 18.The relevant provisions of domestic law governing the organisation and procedure of the National Security Court are quoted in paragraphs 3236 of the Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) judgment, which is being delivered on the same date as the present judgment.",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1.
56.  THE APPLICANT CLAIMED COMPENSATION FOR PECUNIARY AND NONPECUNIARY DAMAGE AS WELL AS REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE DOMESTIC AND CONVENTION PROCEEDINGS. ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION PROVIDES:
“IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION OR THE PROTOCOLS THERETO, AND IF THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTY CONCERNED ALLOWS ONLY PARTIAL REPARATION TO BE MADE, THE COURT SHALL, IF NECESSARY, AFFORD JUST SATISFACTION TO THE INJURED PARTY.”
A.	PECUNIARY DAMAGE
57.  THE APPLICANT CLAIMED THE SUM OF 100,000 FRENCH FRANCS (FRF) BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR THE FINE IMPOSED ON HIM AND PAID (SEE PARAGRAPH 14 ABOVE). THE AMOUNT CLAIMED INCLUDED INTEREST ACCRUED, TOOK ACCOUNT OF THE HIGH RATE OF INFLATION IN THE RESPONDENT STATE AND WAS CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF AN EXCHANGE RATE FROM 1993.
58.  THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THAT THE SUM CLAIMED BY THE APPLICANT WAS EXORBITANT HAVING REGARD TO THE FACT THAT THE APPLICANT WAS ONLY FINED 83,333,333 TURKISH LIRAS AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO PAY THE FINE IN MONTHLY INSTALMENTS. THE GOVERNMENT ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE APPLICANT HAD NOT PROVIDED ANY DETAILS TO SUBSTANTIATE THE AMOUNT CLAIMED FOR HIS ALLEGED OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES.
59.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT COMMENT.
60.  THE COURT WOULD OBSERVE THAT IT CANNOT SPECULATE AS TO WHAT THE OUTCOME OF PROCEEDINGS COMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE 6 § 1 WOULD HAVE BEEN, IRRESPECTIVE OF ITS OWN FINDING THAT THE RESPONDENT STATE IS NOT IN BREACH OF ARTICLE 10 ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPLICANT’S CONVICTION AND SENTENCE. IT CONSIDERS THAT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE APPLICANT’S CLAIM SHOULD BE DISALLOWED.
B.	NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE
61.  THE APPLICANT CLAIMED THAT AS A LAWYER HIS CAREER HAD BEEN BLIGHTED ON ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT HE HAS A CONVICTION RECORDED AGAINST HIM FOR AN OFFENCE OF TERRORISM. HE REQUESTED THE COURT TO AWARD HIM THE SUM OF FRF 80,000 BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR MORAL DAMAGE.
62.  THE GOVERNMENT ARGUED THAT IF THE COURT WERE MINDED TO FIND A VIOLATION IN THIS CASE THAT FINDING WOULD CONSTITUTE IN ITSELF SUFFICIENT JUST SATISFACTION UNDER THIS HEAD.
63.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT COMMENT ON THIS LIMB OF THE APPLICANT’S CLAIM EITHER.
64.  THE COURT RECALLS THAT IT HAS FOUND THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 ON THE FACTS OF THIS CASE. IT CONSIDERS THAT A FINDING OF A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 CONSTITUTES IN ITSELF SUFFICIENT JUST SATISFACTION FOR THE APPLICANT’S ALLEGED NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE.
C.	COSTS AND EXPENSES
65.  THE APPLICANT CLAIMED THE LEGAL COSTS AND EXPENSES (TRANSLATION, POSTAL, COMMUNICATIONS AND TRAVEL EXPENDITURE) WHICH HE INCURRED IN THE PROCEEDING BEFORE THE DOMESTIC COURTS AND THE CONVENTION INSTITUTIONS. HE ASSESSED THESE AT FRF 50,000. AS TO THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION AND COURT THE APPLICANT STATED THAT HIS LAWYER’S FEES WERE BASED ON THE TURKISH BAR ASSOCIATION’S MINIMUM RATE SCALES. THE APPLICANT ADDED THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT CLAIMED TOOK ACCOUNT OF THE HIGH LEVEL OF INFLATION IN TURKEY AND WAS BASED ON CURRENT EXCHANGES RATE.
66.  THE GOVERNMENT STATED THAT THE AMOUNT CLAIMED WAS EXAGGERATED IN COMPARISON WITH FEES EARNED BY TURKISH LAWYERS IN THE DOMESTIC COURTS AND HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY JUSTIFIED. THE CASE WAS SIMPLE AND HAD NOT REQUIRED MUCH EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE APPLICANT’S LAWYER WHO HAD DEALT WITH IT THROUGHOUT THE PROCEEDINGS IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE. THEY CAUTIONED AGAINST THE MAKING OF AN AWARD WHICH WOULD ONLY CONSTITUTE A SOURCE OF UNJUST ENRICHMENT HAVING REGARD TO THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THE RESPONDENT STATE.
67.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT COMMENT.
68.  THE COURT NOTES THAT IT HAS FOUND A BREACH ONLY IN RESPECT OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION. IT FURTHER NOTES THAT THE APPLICANT’S LAWYER HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION OF OTHER CASES BEFORE THE COURT CONCERNING COMPLAINTS UNDER ARTICLES 6 AND 10 OF THE CONVENTION WHICH ARE BASED ON SIMILAR FACTS.

0,001-91848,Grand Chamber,"10.The applicant is a civil servant in the Ministry of National Education. At the relevant time she was on secondment to the Bureau for the primary education of Greek children abroad, in the city of . On 2 June 1998 she filed a criminal complaint for perjury and defamation against S.M., with an application to join the proceedings as a civil party, but without claiming compensation. S.M., a civil servant in the same Ministry, was the applicant's immediate superior. She alleged in particular that, in connection with an administrative investigation opened against her, S.M.had stated that she did not observe working hours and did not get on well with her colleagues. 11.On 26September 2001, when the case was heard before the Athens Criminal Court, the applicant reiterated her civil-party application, claiming 1,000 drachmas (about 3 euros) and adduced her arguments. On the same day, the Athens Criminal Court acquitted S.M. of the charges against him, finding that the applicant's allegations were unsubstantiated. In particular, after examining all the evidence, the court considered that the offending remarks had been truthful and that it had not been the defendant's intention to defame or insult the applicant (judgment no. 74941/2001). 12.On 5 August 2002 this judgment was finalised and entered in the register of the Criminal Court. 13.On 24 September 2002 the applicant requested the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation to lodge an appeal on points of law against the Athens Criminal Court's judgment no.74941/2001, under Article 506 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Orders shall also be made by the public prosecutor where he has a statutory obligation to take measures during a judicial investigation in a case or when hearings have been adjourned by the court ...” Article 139 “Judgments, orders of the chamber of judges, and orders of the investigating judge or of the public prosecutor shall give specific and precise reasons ... ...

115,001-60487,Grand Chamber,"11.Between 1984 and 1992 the applicant was the sole managing director of London Clubs Limited (“LCL”), a company which owned and controlled six of the twenty casinos licensed to operate in London. LCL was a subsidiary company of London Clubs International PLC (“LCI”) of which the applicant was also managing director. Both companies will hereafter be collectively referred to as London Clubs. 12.In June 1991 a raid took place at the various premises of LCL. The raid was carried out by the police in the presence of officials of the Gaming Board for Great Britain (“the Gaming Board”), a statutory body which regulates and monitors the gaming industry. A large quantity of documents was seized. In March 1992 the Gaming Board lodged objections with the clerk to the Licensing Magistrates with regard to LCL's annual application for renewal of the licences it held in respect of each of its casinos. The Gaming Board also made cancellation applications in respect of the existing licences held by LCL. A meeting was held between the Gaming Board and the non-executive directors of LCL and their legal advisers on 26 March 1992. As a result of that meeting, the applicant and the other executive directors (with the exception of the finance director) resigned with effect from 30 April 1992, on the understanding that such resignation was involuntary and constituted dismissal by London Clubs. Subsequently an agreement was reached between the Gaming Board and London Clubs, whereby LCL would apply for new licences for the casinos via reconstituted operating companies, to which applications the Gaming Board would not object. If the applications were successful and new licences were granted by the Licensing Magistrates, LCL would undertake to surrender its existing licences, thereby avoiding the necessity for the applications for cancellation or renewal to be heard. The Gaming Board issued LCL with certificates of consent, which LCL was statutorily obliged to obtain from the Gaming Board as a prerequisite to making an application to the Licensing Magistrates for new licences. Objections to the issuing of new licences were made by a rival casino owner. However, these objections were rejected and new licences were granted in October 1992, after a three day hearing before the Licensing Magistrates. The Gaming Board was represented at the hearing and expressed to the Licensing Magistrates its support for the application of LCL, explaining the grounds on which the Gaming Board itself had granted LCL certificates of consent in the following terms: “In determining that it should issue certificates of consent the Board took into consideration, amongst other relevant factors, the degree to which LCI had addressed the Board's grave concerns at the matters of complaint referred to above, and in particular had in mind the following: Those executive directors of LCI and of [LCL] who in the Board's view carried the principal responsibility for the matters of complaint ... [the applicant was named along with nine others] have left the company and relinquished their management shares. ... The Board and Police viewed the matters raised in their cancellation applications extremely seriously. However they are satisfied that the practices that were unacceptable have now been eradicated and that those individuals responsible for encouraging or tolerating them have been removed.” 13.In November 1992 the Chairman of the Gaming Board, Lady Littler, addressed the British Casino Association at its annual luncheon. Her speech referred to London Clubs and commented: “We [the Gaming Board] satisfied ourselves that the practices we and the Police had regarded as unacceptable had ceased, that persons regarded by the Board and Police as not fit and proper had been removed ...” 14.As a result of this speech, the applicant's legal advisers entered into correspondence with the Gaming Board's solicitors, on the basis that the speech was defamatory. The Gaming Board alleged that the “persons” referred to were minority shareholders and no reference to the applicant was intended. The applicant did not accept this explanation, but did not institute defamation proceedings. 15.By a letter of 22 December 1992, the applicant's legal advisers received written notice that the Gaming Board was considering whether the applicant was a fit and proper person to hold the Board's certificate of approval, as required by section 19 of the Gaming Act 1968 (“the 1968 Act”) in order to hold a management position in the gaming industry. By a letter dated 23 April 1993, the Gaming Board informed the applicant formally that it was “minded to revoke” the applicant's section 19 certificates and that the applicant would be given the opportunity to state his case against revocation either in writing or orally at an interview before the Gaming Board (“a section 19 hearing”). The letter detailed the matters which the Gaming Board wished to discuss with the applicant and also referred to the particulars of the Gaming Board's complaints in the application for cancellation of LCL's licences (the hearing of which had, in fact, never taken place). In these complaints, numbered B1 to B9, it was claimed, inter alia, that there had been breaches of section 16 of the 1968 Act, in that cheques had been accepted without any expectation that they would be met promptly (B1); that the applicant had been involved in granting cheque-cashing facilities to members without proper investigation of their creditworthiness (B2); that cheques had been accepted which exceeded the authors' cheque-cashing facility (B3); that third-party cheques had been accepted in a way which would permit circumvention of the 1984 Guidelines of the British Casino Association (B4); that Japanese players had been assisted in breaching Japanese exchange-control regulations (B5); that gifts or hospitality had been made to substantial players in breach of further 1984 guidelines (B7); and that the method for computing the “cash drop” in casinos produced inaccuracies, and was open to abuse (B9). Examples were given. 16.The applicant's legal advisers objected to the Gaming Board presiding the section 19 hearing, suggesting that an independent tribunal be set up as an alternative. The applicant's principal objection was based on the fact that the Gaming Board had already publicly expressed the view (at the hearing before the Licensing Magistrates) that the applicant was not a fit and proper person to remain an executive director of London Clubs. As such, the applicant contended, the Gaming Board could not be considered an impartial tribunal appropriate to consider the issue of whether the applicant's section 19 certificates should be revoked. 17.The Gaming Board rejected the request for an independent tribunal and the section 19 hearing opened on 11 April 1994 before a panel of three, all members of the Gaming Board (“the Panel”). The hearing was conducted in private and lasted for seven and a half days. The applicant was represented by senior counsel. The Gaming Board's solicitors, a senior Gaming Board official and a representative of the Gaming Board's accountants also attended the hearing. By a letter dated 28 May 1994, the applicant was informed that the Gaming Board did not consider the applicant to be a fit and proper person to continue to hold the Board's certificates of approval and that, accordingly, the Board would revoke his section 19 certificates within twenty-one days of receipt of the letter. This letter detailed the matters which had been of concern to the Gaming Board and the complaints that it deemed established against the applicant. 18.The effect of the revocation of the section 19 certificates was that the applicant was unable to obtain employment in any sector of the gaming industry in the United Kingdom or in any jurisdiction which had a relationship with the United Kingdom gaming authorities. 19.By an application dated 23 August 1994, the applicant sought leave to apply for judicial review of the decision of the Gaming Board to revoke his section 19 certificates. The decision was challenged on the grounds that the Panel was biased, or had the appearance of bias, and that its findings were vitiated by errors of law and were irrational. 20.In the course of the judicial review proceedings, a document entitled “Confidential Annex to Minutes of the 281st Board Meeting of the Gaming Board for Great Britain”, dated 21 January 1993, was produced, attached to an affidavit sworn by the Chairman of the Gaming Board. This document recorded that the Gaming Board had decided at its meeting on 21 January 1993 that it had “sufficient evidence before it to conclude that [the applicant] ... was not a fit and proper person to be a director of a casino company”. 21.All the members of the Panel before which the section 19 hearing took place had been present at the Board meeting and were parties to this decision, which had been taken prior to the hearing itself. 22.The application for judicial review was dismissed on 11 January 1996 by Mr Justice Jowitt after a hearing lasting over sixteen days. He delivered three separate judgments in respect of the applicant's appeal. The first judgment dealt with the scope of the phrase “a fit and proper person” in Schedule 5 of the 1968 Act. The second judgment considered the applicant's claim that he had a “legitimate expectation” that the Gaming Board would be precluded from taking account of any breaches of its guidelines unless the breaches were unlawful. The third judgment, which dealt with “Wednesbury” challenges and allegations of bias, ran to 165 pages. Mr Justice Jowitt stated that the scope of the judicial review was such that he was not concerned to review findings of fact, as for an appeal, but rather to assess whether the findings of the Panel disclosed illegality, irrationality (“Wednesbury unreasonableness”) or procedural impropriety. 23.On pages 28 to 93 of the third judgment, Mr Justice Jowitt dealt with the applicant's “Wednesbury” challenges to the findings in respect of the various complaints made of him. 24.By way of example, it was accepted that cheques drawn by one player, a Mr S., on a Spanish and a Swiss bank were not cleared within twenty-one days after payment into a British bank, as would be the normal course of events. Rather, the average time for clearance was 179 days. The Board found that this practice breached section 16 of the 1968 Act, which prohibits credit betting save when a cheque is exchanged for tokens. The applicant alleged that the cheques he accepted were not shams, as none of the Spanish cheques was ever dishonoured. The judge found that the Board's conclusion – that what took place amounted to an agreement between Mr S. and LCL, such that section 16 was breached – was a conclusion it was entitled to reach. 25.Fifty-seven pages of the third judgment were devoted to the issue of bias. Mr Justice Jowitt described the test of bias under English law in the following terms (pp. 93-96 of the judgment): “[Counsel for the applicant] submits that the decision to revoke the applicant's section 19 certificates of approval should be quashed because the Panel was biased. The grounds on which leave to move for judicial review were granted asserted firstly that the Board could not and did not approach its decision with objectivity and impartiality. Secondly, it was asserted that whether or not there was actual bias the applicant reasonably believed there was and that the Board should have had regard to the appearance of bias which had been created by its actions ... There was no disagreement between the parties as to the approach the court should adopt when bias is alleged. It is a two-stage test. The applicant has first to show from the evidence that there is an appearance of bias (R. v. Inner West London Coroner, ex parte Dallaglio [1994] 4 All England Law Reports 139). [Counsel for the Gaming Board] properly and realistically accepts that in the light of the available evidence the applicant has surmounted this hurdle. Having done so, he has to go on to show that on a proper examination by the court of the evidence before it there is demonstrated a real danger of injustice having occurred as a result of bias ... [The analysis in that case of] the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Gough [1993] Appeal Cases 646 ... illuminates my task in relation to this second stage. 26.Mr Justice Jowitt then applied the test of bias which he had set out to the facts of the case, and concluded that, on the evidence before him, he could not say that the applicant had established that there was a real danger of injustice having occurred as a result of bias. He concluded that there was no unconscious bias on the part of any of the Panel members. 27.Mr Justice Jowitt stated further that if, contrary to his finding, there was unconscious bias on the part of the Panel, the “doctrine of necessity” fell to be considered. He said: “When a body is charged by statute with the power or duty, which cannot be delegated, to make a decision in circumstances in which a question of bias arises because: (i)in pursuance of that statutory power or duty an initial view has been formed upon a matter affecting the interests of someone in respect of whom the body in the exercise of its statutory power or duty has thereafter to make a decision, or final decision, after receiving and considering representations which he is entitled to make or (ii)in the exercise of a statutory power or duty to make a decision a conflict arises between the interests of another or others which have to be taken into account and the body's own interests: the decision will not be liable to be impugned on account of bias provided that: (i)if only some of those charged with the power or duty to decide are potentially affected by bias such of them as can lawfully withdraw from the decision-making do so, and (ii)those of the decision-makers who are potentially affected by bias but cannot lawfully withdraw use their best endeavours to avoid the effect of bias and, consistently with the purpose for which its decision has to be made, the body takes what reasonable steps are open to it to minimise the risk of bias affecting them ...” Mr Justice Jowitt indicated that if, contrary to his finding, there was unconscious bias on the part of the Panel, the doctrine of necessity would apply, and the decision of the Panel would stand. Counsel for the applicant submitted before Mr Justice Jowitt that the Board had failed to take the reasonable step of appointing an independent body to hear evidence and report to the Panel. Mr Justice Jowitt rejected the submission, on the grounds that no useful reference could have been made to an independent tribunal which did not involve an impermissible delegation. 28.In respect of all other allegations brought by the applicant, MrJustice Jowitt concluded that the applicant had failed to establish that the Panel's decision was irrational or unreasonable or to make out any sufficient ground for judicial review. Mr Justice Jowitt noted that, by trying to frame his allegations in terms of “Wednesbury unreasonableness”, the applicant was in fact making an impermissible attempt to re-argue the case as though on appeal in order to have the factual merits of the case re-examined. 29.The Court of Appeal, after an oral hearing on 4 July 1996, refused an application for leave to appeal from Mr Justice Jowitt's decision. Lord Justice Morritt (with whom Lord Justice Hobhouse agreed) held, on the “doctrine of necessity,” as follows: “I am prepared to assume in favour of [the applicant] that he would have an arguable case sufficient to justify leave to appeal, that there was a real risk that the decision of the tribunal had been actuated by bias even though they were not in fact biased against him. That would leave the question of how the doctrine of necessity would be applied to the facts of the case. [Counsel for the applicant] did not seek to suggest that the propositions of law which [Mr Justice Jowitt] enunciated, and which I have quoted, were not accurately formulated by him, but he sought to challenge the final conclusion, to which I have just referred, that there could have been [no] useful reference to an independent tribunal which did not involve an impermissible delegation. The question of bias, therefore, depends on the very limited point of whether it is arguable that [Mr Justice Jowitt] was wrong in that respect. I am bound to say that, on that limited point, I think he was manifestly right. The decision for the Board was, at the end of the day, whether or not Mr Kingsley was a fit and proper person. That could not be delegated to an independent panel and if they were actuated by bias, apparent or real, then the decision would still have to be made by them. Therefore, on the doctrine of necessity, which is accepted, there could have been no meaningful independent panel and the decision would stand because the decision has to be made by the Board and could not be delegated to the independent tribunal. It seems to me that there is no arguable point, susceptible on this part of the case, which would justify giving leave to appeal.” 30.The Gaming Board for Great Britain (“the Gaming Board”) is a statutory body, established under section 10 of the Gaming Act 1968 (“the 1968 Act”) to regulate and monitor the gaming industry. In order for any company to obtain the requisite gaming licence for premises, a certificate must first be issued by the Gaming Board consenting to the company applying for such a licence (Schedule 2, paragraph 3(1), of the 1968 Act). 31.Under section 19 of the 1968 Act the Gaming Board issues certificates to individuals in order that they be permitted to hold certain positions in the gaming industry. A certificate, once issued, continues to be in force unless and until it is revoked. The Gaming Board may revoke the certificate at any time if it appears to the Board that the person to whom it relates is not a fit and proper person to perform the specified function or act in the specified capacity (Schedule 5, paragraph 6, of the 1968 Act). Twenty-one days' written notice of the revocation must be given to the certificate holder. The Gaming Board has developed a procedure whereby an individual is sent a letter in which the Board states that it is minded to revoke his certificate. This is followed by the submission of written representations and/or an oral hearing.",2002,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

1,001-91848,Grand Chamber,"10.The applicant is a civil servant in the Ministry of National Education. At the relevant time she was on secondment to the Bureau for the primary education of Greek children abroad, in the city of . On 2 June 1998 she filed a criminal complaint for perjury and defamation against S.M., with an application to join the proceedings as a civil party, but without claiming compensation. S.M., a civil servant in the same Ministry, was the applicant's immediate superior. She alleged in particular that, in connection with an administrative investigation opened against her, S.M.had stated that she did not observe working hours and did not get on well with her colleagues. 11.On 26September 2001, when the case was heard before the Athens Criminal Court, the applicant reiterated her civil-party application, claiming 1,000 drachmas (about 3 euros) and adduced her arguments. On the same day, the Athens Criminal Court acquitted S.M. of the charges against him, finding that the applicant's allegations were unsubstantiated. In particular, after examining all the evidence, the court considered that the offending remarks had been truthful and that it had not been the defendant's intention to defame or insult the applicant (judgment no. 74941/2001). 12.On 5 August 2002 this judgment was finalised and entered in the register of the Criminal Court. 13.On 24 September 2002 the applicant requested the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation to lodge an appeal on points of law against the Athens Criminal Court's judgment no.74941/2001, under Article 506 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

97,001-78623,Grand Chamber,"9.The ten applicants are all citizens of Serbia and Montenegro, which was known at the time of the events in question as the (“the FRY”). The first two applicants, Dusan and Zoran Markovic, were born in 1924 and 1952 respectively, and applied to the Court on behalf of Dejan Markovic, deceased son of Dusan Markovic and brother of Zoran Markovic. The third and fourth applicants, Dusika and Vladimir Jontic, were born in 1948 and 1978 respectively, and applied to the Court on behalf of Slobodan Jontic, deceased husband of Dusika Jontic and father of Vladimir Jontic. The fifth applicant, Draga Jankovic, was born in 1947 and applied to the Court on behalf of her deceased husband, Milovan Jankovic. The sixth and seventh applicants, Mirjana and Slavica Stevanovic, were born in 1945 and 1974 respectively, and applied to the Court on behalf of Slavisa Stevanovic, deceased son of Mirjana Stevanovic and brother of Slavica Stevanovic. The eighth, ninth and tenth applicants, Milena, Obrad and Dejan Dragojevic, were born in 1953, 1946 and 1975 respectively, and applied to the Court on behalf of Dragorad Dragojevic, deceased son of Milena and Obrad Dragojevic and brother of Dejan Dragojevic. 10.The applicants lodged the present application to complain of the outcome of an action in damages which they had brought in the Italian courts in respect of an air strike against the FRY. 11.The facts of the case relate to the same events as those considered by the Court in its decision in the case of Banković and Others v. Belgium and Others ((dec.) [GC], no. 52207/99, ECHR 2001-XII). The facts in that case were summarised as follows: “6.The conflict in Kosovo between Serbian and Kosovar Albanian forces during 1998 and 1999 is well documented. Against the background of the escalating conflict, together with the growing concerns and unsuccessful diplomatic initiatives of the international community, the six-nation Contact Group (established in 1992 by the London Conference) met and agreed to convene negotiations between the parties to the conflict.>On 30 January 1999, and following a decision of its North Atlantic Council (NAC), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) announced air strikes on the territory of the FRY in the case of non-compliance with the demands of the international community. Negotiations consequently took place between the parties to the conflict from 6 to 23 February 1999 in Rambouillet and from 15 to 18 March 1999 in . The resulting proposed peace agreement was signed by the Kosovar Albanian delegation but not by the Serbian delegation.>Considering that all efforts to achieve a negotiated political solution to the Kosovo crisis had failed, the NAC decided on, and on 23 March 1999 the Secretary General of NATO announced, the beginning of air strikes (Operation Allied Force) against the FRY. The air strikes lasted from 24 March to 8 June 1999. ...>Three television channels and four radio stations operated from the RTS facilities in . The main production facilities were housed in three buildings at . The master control room was housed on the first floor of one of the buildings and was staffed mainly by technical staff. 10.On 23 April 1999, just after 2 a.m. approximately, one of the RTS buildings at was hit by a missile launched from a NATO forces’ aircraft. Two of the four floors of the building collapsed and the master control room was destroyed. 11.... Twenty-four targets were hit in the FRY that night, including three in .” 12.The partial collapse of the RTS building caused the deaths of sixteen people, including the five relatives of the applicants. 13.On 31 May 2000 the first four applicants brought an action in damages in the Rome District Court under Article 2043 of the Italian Civil Code. The other six applicants applied to be joined to the proceedings on 3November 2000. 14.The applicants believed that civil liability for the deaths of their relatives lay with the Italian Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of Defence and with the Command of NATO’s Allied Forces in Southern Europe (AFSOUTH). They argued that the Italian courts had jurisdiction to hear the case. In particular, on the basis of the wording of Article 6 of the Italian Criminal Code, they submitted that the unlawful act that had caused the alleged damage should be regarded as having been committed in inasmuch as the military action had been organised on Italian territory and part of it had taken place there. They based this argument on the extent of ’s commitment – involving substantial political and logistical support – to the military mission in question. Specifically, Italy, unlike other NATO members, had provided the air bases from which the aircraft that had bombed and the RTS had taken off. They also relied in support of their claim on Article 174 of the Wartime Military Criminal Code and on the London Convention of 1951 and the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions. 15.The defendants argued that the Italian courts had no jurisdiction to hear the case. The proceedings against AFSOUTH were discontinued by the applicants. 16.The Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Defence subsequently sought a preliminary ruling from the Court of Cassation on the question of jurisdiction (regolamento preventivo di giurisdizione) under Article 41 of the Italian Code of Civil Procedure. 17.In written submissions dated 16 November 2001, Assistant Principal State Counsel at the Court of Cassation argued that the application for a preliminary ruling should be declared inadmissible as it concerned the merits of the claim, not the issue of jurisdiction. He stated as follows: “The governmental bodies defending this claim have requested a preliminary ruling on the issue of jurisdiction, arguing that: (a)since the action is brought against the Italian State as a specific (unitary) subject of international law for acts performed in the exercise of its imperium (iure imperii), it cannot be brought in the Italian courts; (b)paragraph 5 of Article VIII of the London Convention of 19 June 1951, which Italy ratified by Law no. 1335 of 1955, does not provide any basis for the action either, as it applies to damage caused in the receiving State. The government seek to show through this jurisdictional issue that the Italian legal system does not contain any provision or principle capable of providing a basis for the alleged personal right [diritto soggettivo perfetto] or of guaranteeing it in the abstract. Accordingly, the position is that: (a)the government argue that the cannot be held liable for acts carried out in the exercise of its imperium; (b)in addition, they deny that the said London Convention can be used to determine the place where the acts which caused the alleged damage took place (it is not by accident that the applicant has cited the provisions of the Criminal Code referring to the place where the offence was committed). It follows that the questions thus raised go to the merits, not to the issue of jurisdiction (see judgment no. 903 of 17 December 1999 of the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court). For these reasons, the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, is asked to declare the application inadmissible, with all the consequences which that entails in law.” 18.In a ruling (no. 8157) of 8 February 2002, which was deposited with the registry on 5 June 2002 and conveyed to the applicants on 11 June 2002, the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court (Sezioni Unite), found that the Italian courts had no jurisdiction. It reasoned as follows: “...>The claim seeks to impute liability to the on the basis of an act of war, in particular the conduct of hostilities through aerial warfare. The choice of the means that will be used to conduct hostilities is an act of government. These are acts through which political functions are performed and the Constitution provides for them to be assigned to a constitutional body. The nature of such functions precludes any claim to a protected interest in relation thereto, so that the acts by which they are carried out may or may not have a specific content – see the judgments of the full court of 12 July 1968 (no. 2452), 17 October 1980 (no. 5583) and 8 January 1993 (no.124). With respect to acts of this type, no court has the power to review the manner in which the function was performed.>While the purpose of the provisions of international agreements governing the conduct of hostilities – the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions (Articles35.2, 48, 49, 51, 52 and 57) and the European Convention on Human Rights (Articles 2 and 15 § 2) – is to protect civilians in the event of attack, they are rules of international law, and so also regulate relations between States. These same treaties lay down the procedure for finding a violation and the sanctions in the event of liability (Article 91 of the Protocol and Article 41 of the Convention); they also designate the international courts and tribunals with jurisdiction to make such a finding. However, the legislation implementing these rules in the does not contain any express provision enabling injured parties to seek reparation from the State for damage sustained as a result of a violation of the rules of international law. The notion that provisions to that effect may implicitly have been introduced into the system through the implementation of rules of international law is at odds with the converse principle that has been mentioned which holds that protected individual interests are no bar to carrying out functions of a political nature. Indeed, in order to enable reparation to be provided in the domestic system for loss sustained as a result of a violation of the ‘reasonable time’ requirement under Article 6 of the Convention on Human Rights, [the State] introduced appropriate legislation (Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001).>No entitlement to a review of the government’s decision concerning the conduct of hostilities with respect to the NATO aerial operations against the can be found in the London Convention of 1951. The fact that the aircraft used to bomb the Belgrade radio and television station were able to use bases situated on Italian territory constitutes but one element of the highly complex operation whose lawfulness it is sought to review and is not therefore relevant to the application of the rule laid down in paragraph 5 of Article VIII of the Convention, which on the contrary presupposes the commission of an act that is amenable to review.” 19.The Court of Cassation’s ruling brought to an end, ipso jure, the proceedings in the Rome District Court. 20.The relevant provisions of the Italian Constitution are as follows: Article 10 § 1 “The Italian legal system shall comply with the generally recognised rules of international law. ...” Article 24 § 1 “Everyone may bring legal proceedings to protect his or her rights and legitimate interests. ...” Article 28 “Civil servants, other agents of the State and public entities shall be directly responsible, in accordance with the criminal, civil and administrative law, for acts committed in breach of rights. In connection with such acts, civil liability shall extend to the State and public entities. ...” Article 113 “Judicial protection of rights and legitimate interests in the ordinary and administrative courts shall always lie against acts of the public administrative authorities. It may not be excluded or limited to extraordinary remedies or specific categories of act. The law shall specify which judicial bodies are empowered to set aside acts of the public authorities, in what cases and with what effects.” 21.Article 31 of Royal Decree no. 1024 of 26 June 1924 provides: “No appeal to the Consiglio di Stato, sitting in its judicial capacity, shall lie against acts or decisions of the government which involve the exercise of political power.” 22.Article 2043 of the Civil Code provides: “Any unlawful act which causes damage to another will render the perpetrator liable in damages under the civil law.” 23.Article 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which deals with the issue of jurisdiction, provides: “For so long as there has been no determination of the merits of the proceedings at first instance, any party may seek a ruling on a question of jurisdiction under Article37 from the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court. ...” Article 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: “A ruling that an ordinary court has no jurisdiction because the case concerns a public authority or is within the province of a special court may be made at any time and at any level of jurisdiction, including by the court of its own motion.” 24.The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code provide: Article 6 “Anyone who commits an offence on the territory of the State shall be punished in accordance with Italian law. The offence will be regarded as having been committed on the territory of the State if all or part of the act or omission at the origin of the offence or all or some of the consequences of such act or omission occurred there.” Article 185 “Restitution and compensation for damage. The commission of an offence shall give rise to an obligation of restitution under the civil law [Articles 2043 et seq. of the Civil Code]. Any offence that causes pecuniary damage [Article 2056 of the Civil Code] or non-pecuniary damage [Article 2059 of the Civil Code] shall impose an obligation on the perpetrator and those accountable for his or her actions under the civil law [Article2047 of the Civil Code] to make reparation.” “A commanding officer of a military force who, in order to inflict damage on the enemy, orders or authorises the use of a means or method of warfare that is prohibited by law or by international treaty or which is in any event contrary to the military code of honour shall be liable on conviction to a minimum of five years’ imprisonment unless the act concerned is a criminal offence under a specific statutory provision. If the act results in a massacre, the minimum term of imprisonment shall be ten years.” 26.In a judgment of 10 July 1992 (no. 124/1993), the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, established the rule that the courts had no jurisdiction to hear cases against the authorities relating to political acts. A trade union had brought an action against the Prime Minister, the Civil Service Ministry and the Ministry of State Education on the ground that the government had failed to comply with their undertakings. The Court of Cassation noted, inter alia, that such a failure could only engage the government’s political responsibility, but could not create a right. It ruled that the courts had no jurisdiction to hear the case after formulating the following principle: “Legislative action is a political act since it is the standard means of performing political and governmental functions. The governmental authority’s conduct in the present case was not, therefore, capable in law of causing individuals damage (whether to their personal rights or to their legitimate interests); it consequently escapes all judicial scrutiny.” 27.The Italian courts had in fact already examined this question in a number of earlier cases and had ruled that, as they were political in nature, the following acts escaped the scrutiny of the domestic courts: (i)a waiver of the right to exercise jurisdiction under Article VII of the Agreement of 1951 between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces (Court of Cassation, Third Criminal Division, 21 March 1962, no. 1645, Kinardi and Others, Giust. Pen. [Criminal Justice], 1963, III, p. 80); (ii)the assignment of property belonging to Italian nationals under the London Convention of 1951 (Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, 12July 1968, no. 2452, De Langlade v. the Treasury, Rivista diritto internazionale [International Law Review], 1969, p. 583); (iii)a Transport Ministry decree suspending permission to transport goods to (Rome District Court, 18 May 1993, Soc. S. and C. Transp. GmbH v. Ministry of Transport, Rivista diritto internazionale privato e processuale [Review of Private International Law and Procedure], 1995, p.755); (iv)a decision by the Ministry of Employment appointing employees’ representatives as delegates to the International Labour Organisation (Lazio Regional Administrative Court, 20 August 1976, no. 492, CISNAL v. Ministry of Employment and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Italian Yearbook of International Law, 1978-79, p. 184); (v)a declaration of war and treaty provisions relating to compensation for war damage ( (I), 28 January 1985, no. 106, Pestalozza v. the Treasury, Trib. Amm. Reg. [Regional Administrative Court Review], 1985, p. 381). 28.The full court of the Court of Cassation delivered a further judgment (no. 5044) on 11 March 2004. It concerned the jurisdiction of the Italian civil courts to hear claims for compensation for damage sustained by a person who had been captured by the German military in 1944 and deported to work for German industry. had pleaded State immunity and the courts of first instance and appeal had held that they had no jurisdiction to make an order against it. The Court of Cassation carried out a very extensive examination of the international treaties on international crime, imprescriptibility, the international responsibility of States, immunity from jurisdiction and of the case-law of various international tribunals. In holding that the immunity plea failed and the Italian courts had to decide the claim, it stated inter alia: “... In a decision no. 8157 of 5 June 2002, this full court did indeed rule that acts performed by the State in the conduct of hostilities escape all scrutiny by the courts, as they are acts through which ‘political’ functions are carried out. The nature of these functions ‘precludes any claim to a protected interest in respect thereto, so that there may or may not be a specific content to the acts through which they are performed’. Pursuant to this principle, the Italian courts were held to have no jurisdiction to hear a claim against the Italian Prime Minister’s Office and the Italian Ministry of Defence for compensation for the destruction of a non-military objective during NATO air strikes against the or for the resultant civilian deaths. It is readily apparent, however, firstly, that the fact that the court cannot contest the manner in which the actions of the supreme head of the res publica are conducted does not prevent it from finding that a criminal offence has been committed or that there is related liability under the criminal or civil law (Articles 90 and 96 of the Constitution; section 15 of Constitutional Law no. 1 of 1953; and section 30 of Law no. 20 of 1962); secondly, by virtue of the principle of adaptation established by Article 10 § 1 of the Constitution, the ‘generally recognised’ principles of international law which govern the fundamental values constituted by the freedom and dignity of the human being and characterise the most serious assaults upon the integrity of those values as ‘international crimes’ have ‘automatically’ been integrated into our system and are entirely apt for use as a standard whereby the injustice of damage caused to others by intentional or negligent ‘acts’ may be gauged. It is evident, therefore, that the principles referred to in this decision cannot be taken into consideration in the instant case. ...>1Granting immunity from jurisdiction to States who have been guilty of such wrongdoing is in manifest contradiction with the aforementioned normative rules because it constitutes an obstacle to the defence of values whose protection, like these norms and principles, must on the contrary be considered essential for the entire international community, even to the point of justifying forms of mandatory response in the most serious cases. Nor is there any doubt that the antinomy must be resolved by giving priority to the highest ranking norms, as the judges in the minority (eight to nine) stated in their dissenting opinion appended to the judgment in Al-Adsani [v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35763/97, ECHR 2001-XI], by precluding in such cases any claim by the State to immunity from suit in the foreign courts.” 29.In 1993 the Italian government decided to send a military expeditionary force to to perform peacekeeping operations. After the expeditionary force had returned to , it was discovered that some of its members had engaged in the torture of Somali prisoners. Two members of the expedition were charged and given prison sentences. They were also ordered to pay compensation to the civil party. In judgment no. 28154 of 7March 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 10 July 2002, the ordered another Italian serviceman and the Ministry of Defence to make reparation for the damage sustained by the relatives of a civilian whom the serviceman had killed unlawfully. 30.The applicants relied in the domestic courts on the Protocol Additional of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I). The Protocol, which ratified through Law no. 672 of 11December 1985, contains, inter alia, the following provisions: Article 35 – Basic rules “1.In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited.>It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.>It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment. ...” Article 48 – Basic rule “In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.” Article 49 – Definition of attacks and scope of application “1.’Attacks’ means acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defence.>The provisions of this Protocol with respect to attacks apply to all attacks in whatever territory conducted, including the national territory belonging to a Party to the conflict but under the control of an adverse Party.>The provisions of this section apply to any land, air or sea warfare which may affect the civilian population, individual civilians or civilian objects on land. They further apply to all attacks from the sea or from the air against objectives on land but do not otherwise affect the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict at sea or in the air.>The provisions of this section are additional to the rules concerning humanitarian protection contained in the Fourth Convention, particularly in Part II thereof, and in other international agreements binding upon the High Contracting Parties, as well as to other rules of international law relating to the protection of civilians and civilian objects on land, at sea or in the air against the effects of hostilities.” Article 51 – Protection of the civilian population “1.The civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations. To give effect to this protection, the following rules, which are additional to other applicable rules of international law, shall be observed in all circumstances.>The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited.>Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.>Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Indiscriminate attacks are: (a)those which are not directed at a specific military objective; (b)those which employ a method or means of combat which cannot be directed at a specific military objective; or (c)those which employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol; and consequently, in each such case, are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction.>Among others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as indiscriminate: (a)an attack by bombardment by any methods or means which treats as a single military objective a number of clearly separated and distinct military objectives located in a city, town, village or other area containing a similar concentration of civilians or civilian objects; and (b)an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.>Attacks against the civilian population or civilians by way of reprisals are prohibited.>The presence or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield, favour or impede military operations. The Parties to the conflict shall not direct the movement of the civilian population or individual civilians in order to attempt to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield military operations.>Any violation of these prohibitions shall not release the Parties to the conflict from their legal obligations with respect to the civilian population and civilians, including the obligation to take the precautionary measures provided for in Article 57. ...” Article 52 – General Protection of civilian objects “1.Civilian objects shall not be the object of attack or of reprisals. Civilian objects are all objects which are not military objectives as defined in paragraph 2.>Attacks shall be limited strictly to military objectives. In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.>In case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used. ...” Article 57 – Precautions in attack “1.In the conduct of military operations, constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects.>With respect to attacks, the following precautions shall be taken: (a)those who plan or decide upon an attack shall: (i)do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special protection but are military objectives within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 52 and that it is not prohibited by the provisions of this Protocol to attack them; (ii)take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental loss or civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects; (iii)refrain from deciding to launch any attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated; (b)an attack shall be cancelled or suspended if it becomes apparent that the objective is not a military one or is subject to special protection or that the attack may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated; (c)effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit.>When a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be that the attack on which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.>In the conduct of military operations at sea or in the air, each Party to the conflict shall, in conformity with its rights and duties under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, take all reasonable precautions to avoid losses of civilian lives and damage to civilian objects.>No provision of this Article may be construed as authorizing any attacks against the civilian population, civilians or civilian objects. ...” Article 91 – Responsibility “A Party to the conflict which violates the provisions of the Conventions or of this Protocol shall, if the case demands, be liable to pay compensation. It shall be responsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of its armed forces.” 31.The applicants also relied in the domestic courts on paragraph 5 of Article VIII of the London Convention of 19 June 1951 between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces, which ratified through Law no. 1335 of 1955. Article I defines certain terms as follows: “... (d)’sending State’ means the Contracting Party to which the force belongs; (e)’receiving State’ means the Contracting Party in the territory of which the force or civilian component is located, whether it be stationed there or passing in transit; ...” Article VIII provides, inter alia: “...>Claims (other than contractual claims and those to which paragraphs 6 or 7 of this Article apply) arising out of acts or omissions of members of a force or civilian component done in the performance of official duty, or out of any other act, omission or occurrence for which a force or civilian component is legally responsible, and causing damage in the territory of the receiving State to third parties, other than any of the Contracting Parties, shall be dealt with by the receiving State in accordance with the following provisions: (a)Claims shall be filed, considered and settled or adjudicated in accordance with the laws and regulations of the receiving State with respect to claims arising from the activities of its own armed forces. (b)The receiving State may settle any such claims, and payment of the amount agreed upon or determinated by adjudication shall be made by the receiving State in its currency. (c)Such payment, whether made pursuant to a settlement or to adjudication of the case by a competent tribunal of the receiving State, or the final adjudication by such a tribunal denying payment, shall be binding and conclusive upon the Contracting Parties. (d)Every claim paid by the receiving State shall be communicated to the sending States concerned together with full particulars and a proposed distribution in conformity with sub-paragraphs (e) (i), (ii) and (iii) below. In default of a reply within two months, the proposed distribution shall be regarded as accepted. (e)The cost incurred in satisfying claims pursuant to the preceding sub-paragraphs and paragraph 2 of this Article shall be distributed between the Contracting Parties, as follows: (f)In cases where the application of the provisions of sub-paragraphs (b) and (e) of this paragraph would cause a Contracting Party serious hardship, it may request the North Atlantic Council to arrange a settlement of a different nature. (g)A member of a force or civilian component shall not be subject to any proceedings for the enforcement of any judgment given against him in the receiving State in a matter arising from the performance of his official duties. (h)Except in so far as sub-paragraph (e) of this paragraph applies to claims covered by paragraph 2 of this Article, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any claim arising out of or in connexion with the navigation or operation of a ship or the loading, carriage, or discharge of a cargo, other than claims for death or personal injury to which paragraph 4 of this Article does not apply.>Claims against members of a force or civilian component arising out of tortious acts or omissions in the receiving State not done in the performance of official duty shall be dealt with in the following manner: (a)The authorities of the receiving State shall consider the claim and assess compensation to the claimant in a fair and just manner, taking into account all the circumstances of the case, including the conduct of the injured person, and shall prepare a report on the matter. (b)The report shall be delivered to the authorities of the sending State, who shall then decide without delay whether they will offer an ex gratia payment, and if so, of what amount. (c)If an offer of ex gratia payment is made, and accepted by the claimant in full satisfaction of his claim, the authorities of the sending State shall make the payment themselves and inform the authorities of the receiving State of their decision and of the sum paid. (d)Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the jurisdiction of the courts of the receiving State to entertain an action against a member of a force or of a civilian component unless and until there has been payment in full satisfaction of the claim.>Claims arising out of the unauthorized use of any vehicle of the armed services of a sending State shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 6 of this Article, except in so far as the force or civilian component is legally responsible.>If a dispute arises as to whether a tortious act or omission of a member of a force or civilian component was done in the performance of official duty or as to whether the use of any vehicle of the armed services of a sending State was unauthorized, the question shall be submitted to an arbitrator appointed in accordance with paragraph2(b) of this Article, whose decision on this point shall be final and conclusive.>The sending State shall not claim immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of the receiving State for members of a force or civilian component in respect of the civil jurisdiction of the courts of the receiving State except to the extent provided in paragraph 5 (g) of this Article. 10.The authorities of the sending State and of the receiving State shall co-operate in the procurement of evidence for a fair hearing and disposal of claims in regard to which the Contracting Parties are concerned. ...”",2006,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT OF CASSATION, SITTING AS A FULL COURT, IS ASKED TO DECLARE THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE, WITH ALL THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH THAT ENTAILS IN LAW.”
18.  IN A RULING (NO. 8157) OF 8 FEBRUARY 2002, WHICH WAS DEPOSITED WITH THE REGISTRY ON 5 JUNE 2002 AND CONVEYED TO THE APPLICANTS ON 11 JUNE 2002, THE COURT OF CASSATION, SITTING AS A FULL COURT (SEZIONI UNITE), FOUND THAT THE ITALIAN COURTS HAD NO JURISDICTION. IT REASONED AS FOLLOWS:
“...
2.  THE CLAIM SEEKS TO IMPUTE LIABILITY TO THE  ON THE BASIS OF AN ACT OF WAR, IN PARTICULAR THE CONDUCT OF HOSTILITIES THROUGH AERIAL WARFARE. THE CHOICE OF THE MEANS THAT WILL BE USED TO CONDUCT HOSTILITIES IS AN ACT OF GOVERNMENT. THESE ARE ACTS THROUGH WHICH POLITICAL FUNCTIONS ARE PERFORMED AND THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR THEM TO BE ASSIGNED TO A CONSTITUTIONAL BODY. THE NATURE OF SUCH FUNCTIONS PRECLUDES ANY CLAIM TO A PROTECTED INTEREST IN RELATION THERETO, SO THAT THE ACTS BY WHICH THEY ARE CARRIED OUT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC CONTENT – SEE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE FULL COURT OF 12 JULY 1968 (NO. 2452), 17 OCTOBER 1980 (NO. 5583) AND 8 JANUARY 1993 (NO. 124). WITH RESPECT TO ACTS OF THIS TYPE, NO COURT HAS THE POWER TO REVIEW THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FUNCTION WAS PERFORMED.
3.  WHILE THE PURPOSE OF THE PROVISIONS OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS GOVERNING THE CONDUCT OF HOSTILITIES – THE PROTOCOL ADDITIONAL TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS (ARTICLES 35.2, 48, 49, 51, 52 AND 57) AND THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (ARTICLES 2 AND 15 § 2) – IS TO PROTECT CIVILIANS IN THE EVENT OF ATTACK, THEY ARE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND SO ALSO REGULATE RELATIONS BETWEEN STATES.
THESE SAME TREATIES LAY DOWN THE PROCEDURE FOR FINDING A VIOLATION AND THE SANCTIONS IN THE EVENT OF LIABILITY (ARTICLE 91 OF THE PROTOCOL AND ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION); THEY ALSO DESIGNATE THE INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS WITH JURISDICTION TO MAKE SUCH A FINDING.
HOWEVER, THE LEGISLATION IMPLEMENTING THESE RULES IN THE  DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY EXPRESS PROVISION ENABLING INJURED PARTIES TO SEEK REPARATION FROM THE STATE FOR DAMAGE SUSTAINED AS A RESULT OF A VIOLATION OF THE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.
THE NOTION THAT PROVISIONS TO THAT EFFECT MAY IMPLICITLY HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE SYSTEM THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IS AT ODDS WITH THE CONVERSE PRINCIPLE THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED WHICH HOLDS THAT PROTECTED INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS ARE NO BAR TO CARRYING OUT FUNCTIONS OF A POLITICAL NATURE.
INDEED, IN ORDER TO ENABLE REPARATION TO BE PROVIDED IN THE DOMESTIC SYSTEM FOR LOSS SUSTAINED AS A RESULT OF A VIOLATION OF THE ‘REASONABLE TIME’ REQUIREMENT UNDER ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, [THE STATE] INTRODUCED APPROPRIATE LEGISLATION (LAW NO. 89 OF 24 MARCH 2001).
4.  NO ENTITLEMENT TO A REVIEW OF THE GOVERNMENT’S DECISION CONCERNING THE CONDUCT OF HOSTILITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE NATO AERIAL OPERATIONS AGAINST THE  CAN BE FOUND IN THE LONDON CONVENTION OF 1951.
THE FACT THAT THE AIRCRAFT USED TO BOMB THE BELGRADE RADIO AND TELEVISION STATION WERE ABLE TO USE BASES SITUATED ON ITALIAN TERRITORY CONSTITUTES BUT ONE ELEMENT OF THE HIGHLY COMPLEX OPERATION WHOSE LAWFULNESS IT IS SOUGHT TO REVIEW AND IS NOT THEREFORE RELEVANT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE RULE LAID DOWN IN PARAGRAPH 5 OF ARTICLE VIII OF THE CONVENTION, WHICH ON THE CONTRARY PRESUPPOSES THE COMMISSION OF AN ACT THAT IS AMENABLE TO REVIEW.”
19.  THE COURT OF CASSATION’S RULING BROUGHT TO AN END, IPSO JURE, THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE ROME DISTRICT COURT.
II.  RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE
20.  THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
ARTICLE 10 § 1

...”
ARTICLE 113

21.  ARTICLE 31 OF ROYAL DECREE NO. 1024 OF 26 JUNE 1924 PROVIDES:
“NO APPEAL TO THE CONSIGLIO DI STATO, SITTING IN ITS JUDICIAL CAPACITY, SHALL LIE AGAINST ACTS OR DECISIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH INVOLVE THE EXERCISE OF POLITICAL POWER.”
22.  ARTICLE 2043 OF THE CIVIL CODE PROVIDES:

ARTICLE 37 OF THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE PROVIDES:
“A RULING THAT AN ORDINARY COURT HAS NO JURISDICTION BECAUSE THE CASE CONCERNS A PUBLIC AUTHORITY OR IS WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF A SPECIAL COURT MAY BE MADE AT ANY TIME AND AT ANY LEVEL OF JURISDICTION, INCLUDING BY THE COURT OF ITS OWN MOTION.”

ARTICLE 6
“ANYONE WHO COMMITS AN OFFENCE ON THE TERRITORY OF THE STATE SHALL BE PUNISHED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITALIAN LAW.

“A COMMANDING OFFICER OF A MILITARY FORCE WHO, IN ORDER TO INFLICT DAMAGE ON THE ENEMY, ORDERS OR AUTHORISES THE USE OF A MEANS OR METHOD OF WARFARE THAT IS PROHIBITED BY LAW OR BY INTERNATIONAL TREATY OR WHICH IS IN ANY EVENT CONTRARY TO THE MILITARY CODE OF HONOUR SHALL BE LIABLE ON CONVICTION TO A MINIMUM OF FIVE YEARS’ IMPRISONMENT UNLESS THE ACT CONCERNED IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE UNDER A SPECIFIC STATUTORY PROVISION.
IF THE ACT RESULTS IN A MASSACRE, THE MINIMUM TERM OF IMPRISONMENT SHALL BE TEN YEARS.”
26.  IN A JUDGMENT OF 10 JULY 1992 (NO. 124/1993), THE COURT OF CASSATION, SITTING AS A FULL COURT, ESTABLISHED THE RULE THAT THE COURTS HAD NO JURISDICTION TO HEAR CASES AGAINST THE AUTHORITIES RELATING TO POLITICAL ACTS.
A TRADE UNION HAD BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST THE PRIME MINISTER, THE CIVIL SERVICE MINISTRY AND THE MINISTRY OF STATE EDUCATION ON THE GROUND THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THEIR UNDERTAKINGS. THE COURT OF CASSATION NOTED, INTER ALIA, THAT SUCH A FAILURE COULD ONLY ENGAGE THE GOVERNMENT’S POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY, BUT COULD NOT CREATE A RIGHT. IT RULED THAT THE COURTS HAD NO JURISDICTION TO HEAR THE CASE AFTER FORMULATING THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLE:
“LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS A POLITICAL ACT SINCE IT IS THE STANDARD MEANS OF PERFORMING POLITICAL AND GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS. THE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY’S CONDUCT IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS NOT, THEREFORE, CAPABLE IN LAW OF CAUSING INDIVIDUALS DAMAGE (WHETHER TO THEIR PERSONAL RIGHTS OR TO THEIR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS); IT CONSEQUENTLY ESCAPES ALL JUDICIAL SCRUTINY.”
27.  THE ITALIAN COURTS HAD IN FACT ALREADY EXAMINED THIS QUESTION IN A NUMBER OF EARLIER CASES AND HAD RULED THAT, AS THEY WERE POLITICAL IN NATURE, THE FOLLOWING ACTS ESCAPED THE SCRUTINY OF THE DOMESTIC COURTS:
(I)  A WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE JURISDICTION UNDER ARTICLE VII OF THE AGREEMENT OF 1951 BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY REGARDING THE STATUS OF THEIR FORCES (COURT OF CASSATION, THIRD CRIMINAL DIVISION, 21 MARCH 1962, NO. 1645, KINARDI AND OTHERS, GIUST. PEN. [CRIMINAL JUSTICE], 1963, III, P. 80);
(II)  THE ASSIGNMENT OF PROPERTY BELONGING TO ITALIAN NATIONALS UNDER THE LONDON CONVENTION OF 1951 (COURT OF CASSATION, SITTING AS A FULL COURT, 12 JULY 1968, NO. 2452, DE LANGLADE V. THE TREASURY, RIVISTA DIRITTO INTERNAZIONALE [INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW], 1969, P. 583);
(III)  A TRANSPORT MINISTRY DECREE SUSPENDING PERMISSION TO TRANSPORT GOODS TO  (ROME DISTRICT COURT, 18 MAY 1993, SOC. S. AND C. TRANSP. GMBH V. MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT, RIVISTA DIRITTO INTERNAZIONALE PRIVATO E PROCESSUALE [REVIEW OF PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PROCEDURE], 1995, P. 755);
(IV)  A DECISION BY THE MINISTRY OF EMPLOYMENT APPOINTING EMPLOYEES’ REPRESENTATIVES AS DELEGATES TO THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION (LAZIO REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE COURT, 20 AUGUST 1976, NO. 492, CISNAL V. MINISTRY OF EMPLOYMENT AND MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, ITALIAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, 1978-79, P. 184);
(V)  A DECLARATION OF WAR AND TREATY PROVISIONS RELATING TO COMPENSATION FOR WAR DAMAGE ( (I), 28 JANUARY 1985, NO. 106, PESTALOZZA V. THE TREASURY, TRIB. AMM. REG. [REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE COURT REVIEW], 1985, P. 381).
28.  THE FULL COURT OF THE COURT OF CASSATION DELIVERED A FURTHER JUDGMENT (NO. 5044) ON 11 MARCH 2004. IT CONCERNED THE JURISDICTION OF THE ITALIAN CIVIL COURTS TO HEAR CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE SUSTAINED BY A PERSON WHO HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY THE GERMAN MILITARY IN 1944 AND DEPORTED TO WORK FOR GERMAN INDUSTRY.  HAD PLEADED STATE IMMUNITY AND THE COURTS OF FIRST INSTANCE AND APPEAL HAD HELD THAT THEY HAD NO JURISDICTION TO MAKE AN ORDER AGAINST IT. THE COURT OF CASSATION CARRIED OUT A VERY EXTENSIVE EXAMINATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL TREATIES ON INTERNATIONAL CRIME, IMPRESCRIPTIBILITY, THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF STATES, IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION AND OF THE CASE-LAW OF VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS. IN HOLDING THAT THE IMMUNITY PLEA FAILED AND THE ITALIAN COURTS HAD TO DECIDE THE CLAIM, IT STATED INTER ALIA:
“... IN A DECISION NO. 8157 OF 5 JUNE 2002, THIS FULL COURT DID INDEED RULE THAT ACTS PERFORMED BY THE STATE IN THE CONDUCT OF HOSTILITIES ESCAPE ALL SCRUTINY BY THE COURTS, AS THEY ARE ACTS THROUGH WHICH ‘POLITICAL’ FUNCTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT. THE NATURE OF THESE FUNCTIONS ‘PRECLUDES ANY CLAIM TO A PROTECTED INTEREST IN RESPECT THERETO, SO THAT THERE MAY OR MAY NOT BE A SPECIFIC CONTENT TO THE ACTS THROUGH WHICH THEY ARE PERFORMED’. PURSUANT TO THIS PRINCIPLE, THE ITALIAN COURTS WERE HELD TO HAVE NO JURISDICTION TO HEAR A CLAIM AGAINST THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE AND THE ITALIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENCE FOR COMPENSATION FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF A NON-MILITARY OBJECTIVE DURING NATO AIR STRIKES AGAINST THE  OR FOR THE RESULTANT CIVILIAN DEATHS. IT IS READILY APPARENT, HOWEVER, FIRSTLY, THAT THE FACT THAT THE COURT CANNOT CONTEST THE MANNER IN WHICH THE ACTIONS OF THE SUPREME HEAD OF THE RES PUBLICA ARE CONDUCTED DOES NOT PREVENT IT FROM FINDING THAT A CRIMINAL OFFENCE HAS BEEN COMMITTED OR THAT THERE IS RELATED LIABILITY UNDER THE CRIMINAL OR CIVIL LAW (ARTICLES 90 AND 96 OF THE CONSTITUTION; SECTION 15 OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW NO. 1 OF 1953; AND SECTION 30 OF LAW NO. 20 OF 1962); SECONDLY, BY VIRTUE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF ADAPTATION ESTABLISHED BY ARTICLE 10 § 1 OF THE CONSTITUTION, THE ‘GENERALLY RECOGNISED’ PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW WHICH GOVERN THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES CONSTITUTED BY THE FREEDOM AND DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN BEING AND CHARACTERISE THE MOST SERIOUS ASSAULTS UPON THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE VALUES AS ‘INTERNATIONAL CRIMES’ HAVE ‘AUTOMATICALLY’ BEEN INTEGRATED INTO OUR SYSTEM AND ARE ENTIRELY APT FOR USE AS A STANDARD WHEREBY THE INJUSTICE OF DAMAGE CAUSED TO OTHERS BY INTENTIONAL OR NEGLIGENT ‘ACTS’ MAY BE GAUGED. IT IS EVIDENT, THEREFORE, THAT THE PRINCIPLES REFERRED TO IN THIS DECISION CANNOT BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE INSTANT CASE. ...
9.1  GRANTING IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION TO STATES WHO HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF SUCH WRONGDOING IS IN MANIFEST CONTRADICTION WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED NORMATIVE RULES BECAUSE IT CONSTITUTES AN OBSTACLE TO THE DEFENCE OF VALUES WHOSE PROTECTION, LIKE THESE NORMS AND PRINCIPLES, MUST ON THE CONTRARY BE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL FOR THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, EVEN TO THE POINT OF JUSTIFYING FORMS OF MANDATORY RESPONSE IN THE MOST SERIOUS CASES. NOR IS THERE ANY DOUBT THAT THE ANTINOMY MUST BE RESOLVED BY GIVING PRIORITY TO THE HIGHEST RANKING NORMS, AS THE JUDGES IN THE MINORITY (EIGHT TO NINE) STATED IN THEIR DISSENTING OPINION APPENDED TO THE JUDGMENT IN AL-ADSANI [V. THE UNITED KINGDOM [GC], NO. 35763/97, ECHR 2001-XI], BY PRECLUDING IN SUCH CASES ANY CLAIM BY THE STATE TO IMMUNITY FROM SUIT IN THE FOREIGN COURTS.”
29.  IN 1993 THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO SEND A MILITARY EXPEDITIONARY FORCE TO  TO PERFORM PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS. AFTER THE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE HAD RETURNED TO , IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT SOME OF ITS MEMBERS HAD ENGAGED IN THE TORTURE OF SOMALI PRISONERS. TWO MEMBERS OF THE EXPEDITION WERE CHARGED AND GIVEN PRISON SENTENCES. THEY WERE ALSO ORDERED TO PAY COMPENSATION TO THE CIVIL PARTY. IN JUDGMENT NO. 28154 OF 7 MARCH 2002, THE TEXT OF WHICH WAS DEPOSITED WITH THE REGISTRY ON 10 JULY 2002, THE  ORDERED ANOTHER ITALIAN SERVICEMAN AND THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE TO MAKE REPARATION FOR THE DAMAGE SUSTAINED BY THE RELATIVES OF A CIVILIAN WHOM THE SERVICEMAN HAD KILLED UNLAWFULLY.

41,001-82846,Grand Chamber,"9.The first applicant is a writer and the second is the chairman of the board of directors of the publishing company P.O.L.; the third was the publication director of the daily newspaper Libération. They were born in 1955, 1944 and 1949 respectively and live in . 10.The first applicant is the author of a book presented as a novel under the title Le Procès de Jean-Marie Le Pen (“Jean-Marie Le Pen on Trial”), published in August 1998 by P.O.L. 11.The novel recounts the trial of a Front National militant, Ronald Blistier, who, while putting up posters for his party with other militants, commits the cold-blooded murder of a young man of North African descent and admits that it was a racist crime. He is defended by a Jewish, left-wing and homosexual lawyer, Pierre Mine. The novel is based on real events and in particular the murders, in 1995, of Brahim Bouaram, a young Moroccan who was thrown into the Seine by skinheads during a Front National march, and of Ibrahim Ali, a young Frenchman of Comorian origin who was killed in Marseilles by militants of the same party. Those militants were convicted in June 1998 after a trial in the during which Front National leaders, Mr Le Pen included, declared that the case was no more than a provocation and a put-up job through which the party’s enemies sought to harm it. The author builds the plot around the lawyer, the main protagonist, who throughout the trial finds himself embroiled in a political debate. At the very beginning he raises the question of Mr Le Pen’s responsibility: “Isn’t the Chairman of the Front National responsible for the murder committed by one of his teenage militants inflamed by his rhetoric?” (page 7). The novel focuses on a number of figures who are characterised by their moral or political positions in relation to the ideology and political party of the far right. The work also seeks to highlight the difficulties and contradictions of certain “anti-racist” stances. 12.The text on the back cover of the book describes the novel as follows: “How can Jean-Marie Le Pen be fought effectively? The youth Ronald Blistier, member of the Front National, has committed a cold-blooded racist murder, killing an Arab youth in the open street. The case has caused an outcry and it is generally agreed that Blistier’s trial should really be that of his mentor. Thirty-year-old Jewish lawyer Pierre Mine is defending the murderer. He has certain ideas about how best to fight Jean-Marie Le Pen. – Set a trap for Le Pen? But it would backfire on all of us, warns his boyfriend Mahmoud Mammoudi. Pierre Mine pursues his fight regardless. His strategy is unfathomable. Won’t he become the punchbag of the anti-racists and the champion of those he seeks to defeat? Jean-Marie Le Pen pretends to show him some respect. He is beset with troubles on all sides – it’s as if those who have no real success in their fight against the Front National are nevertheless suspicious of anyone trying a different approach.” 13.By originating summonses of 20 and 27 November 1998, the Front National and Mr Le Pen brought proceedings against the first two applicants in the Paris Criminal Court for the offence of public defamation against a private individual, as a result of the novel’s publication, under sections29(1) and 32(1) of the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881. Six extracts from the novel were the subject of particular complaint: those (on pages 10, 86, 105-06 and 136) that were reproduced in a judgment delivered by the Paris Court of Appeal on 13 September 2000 (see paragraph 18 below), and the following two passages: On page 28 the author attributes the following remarks to Mrs Blistier, Ronald’s mother: “It might have crossed his mind, but he was never much good at shooting – my husband didn’t like Ronald using his rifle. But maybe the lad was humiliated because he’d never beaten anyone up, when all his mates from the Front National were bragging about their weekly clean-up rounds on the housing estates.” On page 118, concerning a Front National demonstration, the author writes: “The crowd assembled on Place de la Bastille, now whipped up by their master ranter, mostly consists of youths. If you searched them you’d find handguns by their hundreds. They’re ready for a fight – they’re only too pleased if far-left organisations think it’s a good strategy to confront them. The atmosphere is in some ways one of pre-insurrection, but as the journalists present have observed, the feeling on the side of the democrats is more one of disgust than of panic. A fascist coup d’état isn’t yet on the cards, there is more a fear of gangrene setting in – a social disease that can occasionally be stopped from spreading or curbed temporarily.” 14.In a judgment of 11 October 1999, the Paris Criminal Court convicted the second applicant of defamation and the first applicant of complicity in that offence, taking account, however, of only four of the six offending extracts, namely those on pages 10, 86, 105-06 and 136 of the book. They were each sentenced to pay a fine of 15,000 French francs(FRF) (equivalent to 2,286.74 euros (EUR)) and ordered jointly and severally to pay FRF 25,000 (EUR 3,811.23) in damages to each of the civil parties, together with the cost of publishing an announcement of the judgment. In its judgment the court found as follows: “Whether the publication was defamatory: It should first be noted that, whilst the author chose to write a ‘novel’, as indicated on the front cover of the book, he portrays, along with a number of fictional characters, an actual and living political figure, namely Jean-Marie Le Pen, and his party, the Front National. In addition, the author announces the subject matter of his work in the title itself, ‘Jean-Marie Le Pen on Trial’. On the back cover he asks the question ‘How can Jean-Marie Le Pen be fought effectively?’ and in the first few lines of the book he raises another question: ‘Isn’t the Chairman of the Front National responsible for the murder committed by one of his teenage militants inflamed by his rhetoric?’ The reader thus immediately becomes aware that the fictional trial is a vector for direct criticism of Jean-Marie Le Pen, especially since the facts described are largely, and obviously, inspired by actual events which have had a great impact on public opinion. Accordingly, although it is a novel, and although the offending remarks are only made by fictional characters, it can nevertheless be observed that the work seeks to impart clearly expressed ideas and to communicate a certain image of Jean-Marie LePen, his party and their behaviour. The classification of the charge cannot therefore be ruled out purely on the basis of the technique used to that end. The text, regardless of its literary genre, is capable of harming the honour and reputation of the civil parties and it is appropriate to examine each of the offending extracts to establish their meaning and significance and to determine whether, for the charge of defamation to be made out, they are precise enough for the issue of proof to be addressed. First passage, page 10: To allege that Jean-Marie Le Pen is the chief of a gang of killers – in other words, that he heads a group of murderers – constitutes, in the context of the book, an evidently defamatory allegation of sufficiently precise conduct, reference being made to the racist crime committed by the novel’s protagonist, a young Front National member whose criminal act is said to have been inspired by the ideas advocated by Jean-Marie Le Pen. It is of no consequence that the crime of ‘Ronald Blistier’ is not real, because the author’s intention is not to write a satire about an impossible event but, on the contrary, to make the reader believe that, given Jean-Marie Le Pen’s ideology, such a scenario is quite plausible and that he would be accountable for it. The story also evokes – inevitably, for the reader – the trial in June 1998 of the Front National billstickers accused of killing a Comorian youth, Ibrahim Ali, in . Similarly, when the author, a few passages further on, recounts the killing of a black youth called ‘Julien Thoris’, who is thrown into the Seine during a demonstration at which the Front National is present, the reader is bound to recall the real murder of Brahim Bouaram, whose killers were taking part in a march held by that party. The precision of the facts described in the offending extract is thus sufficient to constitute defamation against the civil parties, and the facts thus alluded to were susceptible of proof. Second passage, page 28: The assertion that ‘all his mates from the Front National were bragging about their weekly clean-up rounds on the housing estates’ is not clarified by other remarks or illustrated by any given facts. It may stem from the boastfulness attributed to the character in the novel and is too vague to justify prosecution. Third passage, page 86: The Front National is accused of using violence against those who leave the party. The author has one of his characters warn Ronald Blistier’s lawyer against ‘the Front National’s common strategy’ of ‘battering’ anyone who leaves it (‘to beat you up ... ten against one, with metal bars, truncheons and steel-capped boots, one night as you’re leaving the house’). This extract, which concerns facts that are precise and susceptible of proof, namely the attacking or even killing of anyone who dares to betray and leave the party, damages the honour of the Front National. Fourth passage, pages 105-06: To accuse Jean-Marie Le Pen of making statements ‘with racist overtones that are barely concealed at best’ and to write that ‘from behind each of his assertions looms the spectre of the worst abominations of the history of mankind’ constitutes defamation against him in that he is accused of a form of racism that reminds the reader of the worst atrocities ever perpetrated. The author moreover explains a few lines further on that Jean-Marie Le Pen can put the idea of a racist murder into simple minds like that of Ronald Blistier, who ‘would not have had a gun in his hand and a North African kid at the end of it if Jean-Marie Le Pen had not made it possible’ (p. 106). Fifth passage, page 118: This passage, which describes the young Front National militants firstly as being whipped up by their ‘master ranter’ and secondly as being armed by the hundreds and of creating an atmosphere of ‘pre-insurrection’, is certainly insulting to Jean-Marie Le Pen, but too imprecise to constitute defamation; the subsequent remarks do not concern the Front National but participants in that party’s demonstrations and cannot therefore be taken into account. Sixth passage, page 136: Jean-Marie Le Pen is accused of being a ‘vampire’ who thrives on ‘the bitterness of his electorate’ and ‘the blood of his enemies’, and of being a liar, defaming his opponents to protect himself from the accusations against him. The author develops this image and the term ‘vampire’ by writing, just after the offending passage: ‘... Jean-Marie Le Pen used Ronald Blistier’s life and is now using his death to stir up other Ronald Blistiers, to transform other lost youths into puppets who will have their lives and deaths manipulated by this ruthless puppeteer.’ These allegations about using the life and death of young militants, in driving them to murder and suicide, for personal political ends, are precise and damage the honour and reputation of Jean-Marie Le Pen. As to the existence of good faith: Defamatory allegations are, in law, deemed to have been made with the intention of causing harm, but they can be justified if the writer shows that he was acting in good faith. The court observes in this connection that the author did not simply write a work of fiction. He portrayed to his readers Jean-Marie Le Pen, engaged in his usual activities as Chairman of the Front National, with the intention of criticising him and his party and of challenging their ideas. Mathieu Lindon indeed stated at the hearing that he had made much use of information in the news and, as a result, the reader may not be able to distinguish clearly between fact and fiction, so clear was the intention to associate the situations and remarks with recent events. Although, in the sphere of political polemics and ideological debate, the greatest freedom of expression must be afforded to the author, that freedom is not unrestricted, and stops when it comes to personal attacks, whether they are made directly by the author or through the intermediary of fictional characters, and is discredited by the distortion of facts and by immoderate language. Whereas the defence has asserted that this story reflects reality and does not twist it, the documents produced, which are mainly press articles, being devoid of evidentiary value, are insufficient to substantiate the defamatory allegations taken into account by the court concerning the criminal conduct imputed to the civil parties. No relevant judicial decision against them, which might have justified such assertions, was produced in the proceedings, and in the absence of documents the court can only find that Mathieu Lindon distorted the facts to reinforce the hostility of his readers towards Jean-Marie Le Pen and his party. Furthermore, whilst authors and polemicists are afforded freedom to use a specific register, this does not authorise the particularly excessive remarks that appear in the text. It cannot therefore be accepted that the defendants acted in good faith and the charge of defamation to the detriment of Jean-Marie Le Pen and the Front National is accordingly made out ...” 15.The first two applicants appealed against the above judgment in the Paris Court of Appeal. They challenged the finding that the offending extracts were defamatory in nature. They argued that it was simply a work of fiction portraying fictional characters, as the reader could see from the very first page. They also argued that the remarks merely amounted to value judgments about the claimants, reflecting a public debate, treated with distance and irony, about how best to combat the rise of the far right. In the alternative, pleading good faith, they submitted that the ideas of Mr LePen and the Front National had not been distorted by the book and its characters, and that the offending passages consisted exclusively of remarks made by the fictional characters without reflecting the ideas of the author, who, for his part, had sought to criticise the strategy adopted by anti-racist associations and left-wing intellectuals in general, in their fight against the Front National. The applicants relied on Article 10 of the Convention, claiming that this provision precluded any conviction because a work of fiction was entitled to reflect debate as to the moral responsibility borne by the Front National and its leader’s ideas in the commission of racist crimes. They emphasised that the freedom to hold opinions would be infringed if the author of a value judgment were to be penalised on the pretext that he could not prove the pertinence of his opinion, and referred in this connection to the Lingens v. Austria judgment (8 July 1986, Series A no. 103). Lastly, they argued that equally aggressive and defamatory remarks against the civil parties had been made in the past by politicians or journalists, and that Mr LePen himself had been convicted several times of incitement to racial hatred. 16.In a judgment of 13 September 2000, the Paris Court of Appeal (Eleventh Division, consisting of Mr Charvet, President, Mr Blanc and MrDeletang) upheld the judgment of 11 October 1999 as regards the defamatory nature of three out of the four passages taken into account by the Criminal Court, together with the fines imposed and the damages awarded by that court. 17.In its judgment the Court of Appeal considered, firstly, that the work in question was a “novel”, “a ‘creation of the imagination’ as defined by the Petit Robert dictionary”, whose story line was constructed around the dilemma facing the main character: “The author has developed a plot, based on that framework, running from the beginning of the proceedings against the young defendant until his suicide in prison before counsel’s address and the prosecution speech, and has given expression to many characters who mainly appear as stereotypes characterised by their moral or political position in relation to the civil parties, who themselves are explicitly real people.” It further observed that Mr Le Pen and the Front National, both appearing under their real and current identities, were constantly at the forefront not only of the debate conducted in open court but also of the exchanges between the various characters, “and even at the heart of the intimate contradictions facing the main protagonist”. The court then noted that, on a number of occasions, words had been put into the mouth of MrLePen, who “express[ed] views that [were] close or identical to those [that he took] in reality, but which [had not been] regarded by the civil parties as impugning his honour and reputation or those of the party of which he [was] the leader”. It further considered that the subject of the book was the question set out on the back cover, “How can Jean-Marie Le Pen be fought effectively?”, adding that “to ask that question, even in a novel, [was] not per se defamatory against him”. 18.The court went on to point out that section 29 of the Act of 29July 1881 defined defamation as “any statement or allegation of a fact that impugns the honour or reputation of [a] person” and that the law made no distinction based on the nature of the writing in issue. On that basis, any writing, whether political, philosophical, novelistic or even poetical, was governed by the applicable rules in such matters, with regard both to public order and to the protection of individuals. However, the court added that “the application of the rules on defamation in respect of a press article or other text directly expressing the view of its author requires, if the text is a work of fiction, an examination of the question whether the civil parties are actually the individuals concerned by the offending remarks, and then of the meaning attributed by the author to the words of his characters in the light of the ideas that he expounds in reality in his work”. As to the second point – the first being manifestly established – the court found as follows: “... a distinction has to be made between the offending passages on pages 10, 86, 105, and, lastly, 136, the only extracts now to be taken into account: some of them express the view of the narrator and coincide with the author’s ideas as they emerge from the work as a whole, whilst others can be attributed only to the character making the remarks in question, in so far as the author genuinely distances himself from those remarks throughout the work, either through the narrator or by other means.” Using that method the court ruled as follows on the four passages in question: “1.Page 10: ‘... an effective way to fight Le Pen is to call for him to be put in the dock and show that he isn’t the Chairman of a political party but the chief of a gang of killers – after all, people would have voted for Al Capone too’ [this view is attributed by the author to anti-racist demonstrators who have gathered outside the law courts]. This segment of text is preceded by another, which has not been mentioned by the civil parties: ‘For them, it’s not sufficient to call Ronald Blistier the murderer’, following the narrator’s description of the crowd of ‘anti-racists’ which assembles in front of the law courts during the trial of Ronald Blistier. To assert that Jean-Marie Le Pen is not the Chairman of a political party but the chief of a gang of killers, and then in addition to equate him with Al Capone, is clearly defamatory, as was quite rightly observed by the court below. There is nothing in the preceding or following sentences to suggest that any distance has been taken by the narrator – and therefore, in view of the book’s literary construction, by the author himself – from this statement, which is attributed to the demonstrators gathered outside the law courts, and which, moreover, echoes the question presented on the back cover as the subject of the book: ‘How can Jean-Marie Le Pen be fought effectively?’ This extract accordingly constitutes defamation against the civil parties.>Page 86: ‘He (Blistier [the accused]) wants to frighten you, Pierrot [the lawyer]. He wants to brand you as a member of his clan: that’s a common Front National strategy, to make you look like a traitor if you later make the slightest criticism of LePen or his followers, and so they’ll feel morally entitled to beat you up – to come after you, ten against one, with metal bars, truncheons and steel-capped boots, one night as you’re leaving the house, and give you a clear message that those who join the team stick together for life. Nobody leaves the Front National with impunity. Please don’t try and be clever, Pierrot. I don’t want them to kill you.’ These words are spoken by the boyfriend of the lawyer, Mr Mine, the main protagonist. The speaker is giving his own explanation about the defendant’s attitude towards his counsel during the hearing, in response to a question from Mine. This passage contains comments that are specific to the fictional character, albeit derogatory with regard to the civil parties, as observed by the court below. Nevertheless, and contrary to the assessment of the lower court, they do not appear to be susceptible of proof within the meaning of the Act of 29 July 1881: being attributed to a fictional character, in a situation which is itself fictional, the text does not suggest that they may necessarily be regarded as corresponding to the author’s opinion. This passage is not found to be defamatory.>Pages 105-06: ‘Read the papers, listen to the radio and television, every statement by Jean-Marie Le Pen is bedecked – or rather bespotted and bespattered – with racist overtones that are barely concealed at best. Each of his words is a veil for others and from behind each of his assertions looms the spectre of the worst abominations of the history of mankind. Everyone knows it, everyone says it. What Ronald Blistier did was precisely what Jean-Marie Le Pen advocates. Perhaps not explicitly – he tries to abide by the law, even though he does not always manage to do so. But when you consider the situations in which he speaks, the innuendos he makes and the figures he supports, there can be no doubt’ [here the lawyer is addressing the court]. It is clearly defamatory to accuse Jean-Marie Le Pen of ‘proffering words or assertions with racist overtones that are barely concealed at best and from behind which looms the spectre of the worst abominations of the history of mankind’. Such an accusation is susceptible of debate as to whether or not it holds true in relation to the actual discourse of Jean-Marie Le Pen and the Front National. The defendants cannot legitimately claim impunity for such remarks on the grounds that they derive from novelistic fiction and at the same time that they are covered by the statutory impunity concerning statements made during a judicial hearing. The allegation by the character Mr Mine, the lawyer, that ‘what Ronald Blistier did was precisely what Jean-Marie Le Pen advocates’, following the narrator’s comment – just before the paragraph containing the passage in question – that ‘once again, everyone agrees that this trial should be that of Jean-Marie Le Pen rather than that of Ronald Blistier, otherwise it would never have had such an impact’, shows that through the remarks attributed to his main protagonist it is in fact Mathieu Lindon who is expressing himself here with reference to the civil parties. This extract constitutes defamation against the civil parties.>Page 136: After the defendant’s suicide in prison, his lawyer gives the following statement on television: ‘How can Jean-Marie Le Pen be allowed to play the victim after Ronald Blistier’s suicide? Isn’t the Front National Chairman a vampire who thrives on the bitterness of his electorate, but sometimes also on their blood, like the blood of his enemies? Why does Le Pen accuse democrats of the alleged murder of Ronald Blistier? Because he isn’t afraid of lies – because engaging in defamation against his opponents always appears useful for him, of course, but it is also quite simply a means to deflect suspicion; he’s the one who shouts the loudest in the hope that his ranting will drown out the accusations against himself.’ To describe Jean-Marie Le Pen, Chairman of the Front National, as ‘a vampire who thrives on the bitterness of his electorate, but sometimes also on their blood, like the blood of his enemies’, impugns the honour and reputation of the two civil parties. This passage is part of a long television appearance by the main protagonist – the only one who, apart from his boyfriend, is portrayed in a positive light in the novel, as both characters convey, so to speak, the contradictions and values of the narrator – following the defendant’s suicide in prison. It is evident that this speech, which takes the form of an indictment, and which is presented as the only interview given to the media by the lawyer, who has previously turned down many other requests, constitutes both the synthesis and the final conclusion through which the author seeks to give his character an opportunity to express, with a certain solemnity in the context of this fiction, the author’s own view as a militant writer. Moreover, in the last two pages of the book, following the television statement, no distance whatsoever is introduced between the narrator and the remarks made. This extract thus constitutes defamation against the civil parties.” 19.The Court of Appeal further dismissed the argument that the applicants had acted in good faith, on the following grounds: “Defamatory allegations are deemed to have been made in bad faith unless the defendant can show that they fulfil all of the following conditions: they must correspond to the pursuit of a legitimate aim; they must not reflect any personal animosity on his part towards the civil party; there must have been a serious preliminary investigation; and the language used must be dispassionate. In the present case, the legitimacy of the aim pursued by the defendants through the novel, namely ‘to fight against Jean-Marie Le Pen effectively’, in other words to engage in a political combat, cannot be challenged in a democratic society. With its claim to be a ‘combative’ work, the novel in question, and in particular the passages found to be defamatory, attest to patent animosity towards the civil parties. However, that animosity is explicitly related to the aversion felt by the defendants in reaction to the ideas and values presented for public debate by the civil party as Chairman of the Front National. That animosity, which is not directed against the civil party in person, cannot be regarded as reprehensible per se. Since this is a work of fiction, the question of the seriousness of the investigation underpinning the work cannot be assessed as if it were a text intended to inform the reader of real facts or comment on such facts. However, the principle adopted for the construction of the work in issue, as can be seen explicitly from a reading of the text and as the defendants have asserted before the court, is based on the juxtaposition within an imaginary plot of, on the one hand, various fictional characters, and on the other, the Chairman of the Front National, a real figure, who represents the focus in relation to which the imaginary characters take shape and around which they revolve throughout the novel. Furthermore, the ideas, rhetoric, acts and gestures of Jean-Marie Le Pen are accurately described in the novel – as the defendants have claimed, producing cogent evidence to that effect – in relation to the reality of the various public manifestations of his political activity. Accordingly, it is appropriate to examine whether the use of the defamatory comments chosen by the author was preceded by an investigation sufficiently serious to justify the comments in question. In this connection, whilst the rhetoric and ideas attributed to the civil parties, together with the ensuing debates, are unquestionably consonant with the actual representation of the ideas of the Front National in reports on French political life today, the defendants have failed to adduce any specific evidence to show that the use of the wording found to be defamatory was preceded by basic verification as to the reality supposed to be evoked by that wording. Similarly, it cannot be said that the form of expression used in the three extracts found to be defamatory is sufficiently dispassionate: to liken Jean-Marie Le Pen to the ‘chief of a gang of killers’ (page 10), to assert that the murder committed by Blistier – a fictional character – was ‘advocated’ by Jean-Marie Le Pen – a real person – and to describe the Chairman of the Front National – a real person – as a ‘vampire who thrives on the bitterness of his electorate, but sometimes also on their blood’, clearly oversteps the permissible limits in such matters. It cannot therefore be accepted that the defendants acted in good faith. Lastly, the argument derived from the application of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, whereby ‘a value-judgment made about a politician is by nature not susceptible of proof’ is ineffective. The allegations found in the present case to be defamatory, directed against a real politician, do not merely constitute value-judgments within the meaning of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights cited above, in a case where a journalist had described the conduct of a politician as ‘the basest opportunism’, ‘immoral’ and ‘undignified’. In Mr Lindon’s case, he accuses the civil party of certain concrete practices (describing him as the ‘chief of a gang of killers’, ‘advocating the perpetration of a murder’ and ‘a vampire who thrives on the bitterness and the blood of his voters’).” 20.In a judgment of 27 November 2001, the Court of Cassation dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the first two applicants. It rejected as follows the ground based on an alleged breach of Article 10 of the Convention: “... In finding the defendants guilty of public defamation against a private individual, taking into account three extracts from the work, the judges, who made an accurate assessment of the meaning and significance of the offending writings, justified their decision without breaching the Convention provisions referred to in the ground of appeal. Whilst Article 10 of the Convention ... recognises, in its first paragraph, that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, that provision states, in its second paragraph, that the exercise of this right, carrying with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation of others. ...” 21.In its edition of 16 November 1999, in a column entitled “Rebonds” (“reactions”), the daily newspaper Libération published an article signed by ninety-seven contemporary writers concerning the first two applicants’ conviction, on charges of defamation and complicity in defamation, by the Paris Criminal Court in its judgment of 11 October 1999 (see paragraph 14 above). The article took the form of a petition and read as follows: “Petition. The passages from the book ‘Jean-Marie Le Pen on Trial’ for which Mathieu Lindon and his publisher were convicted are not defamatory. We are prepared to write them in a novel. We will write against Le Pen. Novels cannot be granted unlimited rights. But they have the right to exist and to evoke the real world in which the author and his peers live. Mathieu Lindon and his publisher Paul Otchakovsky-Laurens were convicted of defamation against Jean-Marie Le Pen on account of four passages in the novel ‘Jean-Marie Le Pen on Trial’. To write, in a novel, that demonstrators who pay tribute to the victim of a racist murder consider that: ‘For them, it’s not sufficient to call Ronald Blistier the murderer; an effective way to fight Le Pen is to call for him to be put in the dock and show that he isn’t the Chairman of a political party but the chief of a gang of killers – after all, people would have voted for Al Capone too’ is not defamatory in my view and I am prepared to write this in a novel. To write, in a novel, that the boyfriend of a lawyer defending a murderer who belongs to the Front National gives the lawyer this warning: ‘He wants to frighten you, Pierrot. He wants to brand you as a member of his clan: that’s a common Front National strategy, to make you look like a traitor if you later make the slightest criticism of Le Pen or his followers, and so they’ll feel morally entitled to beat you up – to come after you, ten against one, with metal bars, truncheons and steel-capped boots, one night as you’re leaving the house, and give you a clear message that those who join the team stick together for life. Nobody leaves the Front National with impunity. Please don’t try and be clever, Pierrot. I don’t want them to kill you’ is not defamatory in my view and I am prepared to write this in a novel. To write, in a novel, that a lawyer, in defending his client who is accused of a racist crime puts the following arguments to the court: ‘Read the papers, listen to the radio and television, every statement by Jean-Marie Le Pen is bedecked – or rather bespotted and bespattered – with racist overtones that are barely concealed at best. Each of his words is a veil for others and from behind each of his assertions looms the spectre of the worst abominations of the history of mankind. Everyone knows it, everyone says it. What Ronald Blistier did was precisely what Jean-Marie Le Pen advocates. Perhaps not explicitly – he tries to abide by the law, even though he does not always manage to do so. But when you consider the situations in which he speaks, the innuendos he makes and the figures he supports, there can be no doubt’ is not defamatory in my view and I am prepared to write this in a novel. To write, in a novel, that a lawyer who has poorly defended his client, a Front National member accused of a racist murder, makes the following analysis: ‘How can Jean-Marie Le Pen be allowed to play the victim after Ronald Blistier’s suicide? Isn’t the Front National Chairman a vampire who thrives on the bitterness of his electorate, but sometimes also on their blood, like the blood of his enemies? Why does Le Pen accuse the democrats of the alleged murder of Ronald Blistier? Because he isn’t afraid of lies – because engaging in defamation against his opponents always appears useful for him, of course, but it is also quite simply a means to deflect suspicion; he’s the one who shouts the loudest in the hope that his ranting will drown out the accusations against himself’ is not defamatory in my view and I am prepared to write this in a novel. If these passages are to be considered defamatory in a novel, they are also defamatory in reality. I should be sued by Jean-Marie Le Pen and convicted by a court, if they are true to their own logic, for having reproduced those extracts here.” 22.It was on account of the above article that Mr Le Pen and his party summoned the third applicant to appear before the Paris Criminal Court in his capacity as publication director of Libération, alleging that he had committed the offence of public defamation against a private individual (under sections 29(1), 32(1) and 42 of the Freedom of the Press Act of 29July 1881). 23.In a judgment of 7 September 2000, the court found the applicant guilty of the criminal offence of defamation and sentenced him to pay a fine of FRF 15,000 (EUR 2,286.74). It also awarded FRF 25,000 (EUR3,811.23) in damages. The court, after observing that Libération had reproduced in extenso passages from the work that it had characterised as defamatory in its judgment of 11 October 1999, found that “the defamatory nature of the remarks, which ha[d] already been found to have impugned the honour and reputation of another and ha[d] been repeated in the offending article, [was] ... not in doubt”. As to the question of good faith, the court found that, whilst the newspaper Libération was entitled to comment on a judicial decision and to impart ideas and information on questions that formed the subject of public debate, it was nevertheless true that there was “a distinction between the right of petition and the publicity given to a petition by the use of objectionable terms”. In the court’s view, the publication of the defamatory passages in abstracto, outside their literary context, strengthened the dishonouring force of the allegations, which were shifted to the terrain of reality and plausibility, without any debate of ideas, as the signatories of the article had emphasised in concluding: “If these extracts are to be considered defamatory in a novel, they are also defamatory in reality.” The court added that other newspapers had reported on the debate triggered by the publication of “Jean-Marie Le Pen on Trial” and the petition following the conviction of its author but had not reproduced the offending comments in extenso. It inferred that the third applicant “could ... have reported on the offending petition and informed readers of the views of numerous writers and journalists, without, however, reiterating the offence of which Mr Lindon and his publisher had been convicted by reproducing the passages that had been found to be defamatory in the court’s previous decision”. 24.On 12 September 2000 the third applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment. He contended that the impugned article was part of a broader political debate concerning the Front National and its Chairman, and that the debate was intense because of events that had actually taken place. It was those events which had provided the inspiration for the novel by the first applicant, whose cause had been defended by the signatories of the petition, reacting in a democratic spirit and out of vigilance towards the far-right movement. The third applicant explained that the column “Rebonds” was specifically reserved for the opinions of commentators from outside the newspaper who expressed their views with the intention of triggering debate and provoking reactions among readers. He added that the column, in principle, was not supposed to be objective or impartial but to convey opinions and therefore entailed the freedom to hold those opinions. He argued that the free discussion of political matters should not be hindered by excessive requirements relating to the protection of the rights of others or the prevention of disorder. 25.In a judgment of 21 March 2001, the Eleventh Division of the Paris Court of Appeal (consisting of Mr Charvet, President, and Judges Deletang and Waechter) upheld all the provisions of the judgment under appeal. The court pointed out that, in its judgment of 13 September 2000 (see paragraphs 16-19 above), it had upheld the conviction of the first two applicants on account of three out of the four offending passages in the novel. It reproduced those passages and, as regards the defamatory nature of the article, referred back to the grounds set out in the 13 September 2000 judgment, of which, it stated, the reasoning “remain[ed] applicable”. It went on to dismiss the defence of good faith on the following grounds: “The existence of controversy surrounding Mr Le Pen and the Front National has been patent for many years, and that controversy has taken on a polemical aspect at certain times. As regards the work ‘Jean-Marie Le Pen on Trial’, the court found in its previous judgment that it was established that its very subject matter was the fight against the political ideas of the civil parties, which in this case had taken the form of a novel. Such a medium does not preclude the application of the Act of 29 July 1881 where, firstly, the characters portrayed can be identified as real people, and, secondly, the defamatory allegations against them are a reflection not of the narrative process but of the author’s own views. On the basis of that analysis, the court considered that this situation obtained in respect of the novel itself. It is all the more true for the impugned article, which is presented as a shift from fiction in two ways, being published even though the passages in question had formed the basis of a conviction and by clearly indicating that shift: ‘If these passages are to be considered defamatory in a novel, they are also defamatory in reality. We will write against Le Pen.’ The authors of the text in issue had no other aim than that of showing their support for Mathieu Lindon by repeating with approval, out of defiance, all the passages that had been found defamatory by the court, and without even really calling into question the defamatory nature of the remarks. The polemical aim of a text cannot absolve it from all regulation of expression, especially when, far from being based merely on an academic debate, its line of argument is built around reference to precise facts. There was therefore an obligation to carry out a meaningful investigation before making particularly serious accusations such as incitement to commit murder, and to avoid offensive expressions such as those describing Mr Le Pen as the ‘chief of a gang of killers’ or as a vampire. The defence of good faith cannot be admitted ...” 26.On 23 March 2001 the third applicant appealed on points of law, claiming in particular that there had been a violation of Articles 10 and 6 of the Convention. In respect of Article 6 he contended that the Court of Appeal had already ruled on the defamatory nature of the book in question and that it had relied on that earlier judgment, so that the appeal had not been heard by an impartial tribunal but by a “court which openly regarded itself as clearly targeted by the offending article”. 27.In a judgment of 3 April 2002, the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal in the following terms: “... It is apparent from the decision appealed against that Serge July, publication director, was summoned to appear before the Eleventh Division of the Court of Appeal on a charge of public defamation against a private individual, on account of having published an article. That article incorporated certain passages from a book for which the author had previously been found guilty under section 29 of the Act of 29July 1881 by a bench of the Court of Appeal consisting of President Charvet and Judges Blanc and Deletang. The appellant is not entitled to complain that Judges Charvet and Deletang sat on the bench of the appellate court before which he appeared, in so far as the participation in this case of a number of judges of the criminal division of the Court of Appeal in proceedings concerning charges brought, firstly, against the author of a defamatory text and, secondly, against the publication director who allowed certain passages from that text to be published, is not contrary to the requirement of impartiality enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. In addition, contrary to what has been alleged, there is nothing in the judgment appealed against to suggest that the judges deemed themselves to be targeted by the offending text or that they expressed an opinion contrary to the requirement of impartiality. ... In finding Serge July guilty ... the Court of Appeal stated that the polemical aim of a text could not absolve it from all regulation of expression, when, far from being based merely on an academic debate, its line of argument was built around reference to precise facts. The court added that, in this case, the accusations that had been made without a meaningful prior investigation were particularly serious ones, the civil party having been described as the ‘chief of a gang of killers’ or as a vampire. In these circumstances the Court of Appeal justified its decision without breaching Article 10 of the Convention ...” 28.The relevant parts of the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881 provide as follows: Section 29 “It shall be defamatory to make any statement or allegation of a fact that impugns the honour or reputation of the person or body of whom the fact is alleged. The direct publication or reproduction of such a statement or allegation shall be an offence, even if expressed in tentative terms or if made about a person or body not expressly named but identifiable by the terms of the disputed speeches, shouts, threats, written or printed matter, placards or posters. It shall be an insult to use any abusive or contemptuous language or invective not containing an allegation of fact.” Section 32(1) “Anyone who by any of the means set out in section 23 [including ‘written’ and ‘printed’ matter and ‘any other written medium’ ‘sold or distributed, or offered for sale’] makes a statement that is defamatory of private individuals shall be liable on conviction to six months’ imprisonment and a fine of 12,000 euros, or to one only of those sentences”. Section 42 “The following persons shall be liable, as principals, in the following order, to penalties for offences committed via the press:>Publication directors or publishers, irrespective of their occupation or title ...” 29.An individual may be defamed through the portrayal of characters in a novel or play, without it being necessary for the name of the imaginary person to correspond to that of the individual who claims to have been defamed, provided he or she is referred to in a clear manner such that the public cannot be mistaken (Paris Court of Appeal, 8 March 1897). On the other hand, the fact that the name of the imaginary person corresponds to that of a living person is not sufficient for the latter to allege defamation, even if there are certainly similarities of character and diffusion (Algiers Court of Appeal, 20 February 1897). Such situations mostly give rise to proceedings for civil liability and damages are awarded whenever there has been prejudice, that is to say when the public has unavoidably been led to associate the living person with the imaginary person and where an error of judgment can be attributed to the author (Paris Court of Appeal, 24April 1936, and Paris Court of Appeal, 8 November 1950).

182,001-80249,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicants were born in 1955, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1937, 1957, 1983 and 1981 respectively and live in Sonkakoski and Sonkajärvi. 10.The first five applicants and the late Mr Hannu Matti Lappalainen worked in the Sonkajärvi Police District. Under a collective agreement concluded in 1986, they were entitled to a remote-area allowance, which was added to their salaries as a bonus for working in a remote part of the country. The amounts of the allowance were calculated on the basis of a given area’s remoteness. By a collective agreement concluded on 15 March 1988, the remote-area allowance was abolished. This would have resulted in a reduction of the salary payable to civil servants whose duty station was Sonkajärvi. In order to prevent such a reduction, the collective agreement granted them monthly individual wage supplements from 1 March 1988. 11.On 1 November 1990 the Sonkajärvi Police District was incorporated into the Iisalmi Police District by a decision of the Ministry of the Interior (sisäasiainministeriö, inrikesministeriet). Following the incorporation, the applicants’ duty station changed. They also lost their individual wage supplements and the length of their commute allegedly increased by up to 50 km per day as they had to travel from Sonkajärvi to Iisalmi. 12.According to the applicants, following their request of 17 October 1990 to that effect, the Kuopio Provincial Police Command (läänin poliisijohto, länspolisledningen) promised that their loss would be compensated. 13.On 25 March 1991 the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior, at the request of the Provincial Police Command, submitted a request for authorisation for the payment of monthly individual wage supplements, amounting to between 500 and 700 Finnish marks (FIM) (84118 euros) per person, to those police officers and other personnel whose duty station had been changed from Sonkajärvi to Iisalmi. The request referred to an allegedly analogous case (the Mäntyharju case) in which the Ministry of Finance (valtiovarainministeriö, finansministeriet) had granted a request for individual wage supplements on 29 December 1989. On 3 July 1991 the Ministry of Finance replied that it could not grant such authorisation. It gave no reasons for its refusal. 14.On 1 October 1992 competence to decide on wage supplements in respect of local police forces was transferred to the County Administrative Boards (lääninhallitus, länsstyrelsen). 15.On 19 March 1993 the applicants lodged an application requesting that they be compensated for their loss. They referred to the above decision in the Mäntyharju case. They also relied on the principle of equality as laid down in Article 5 of the Constitution then in force (Suomen hallitusmuoto, Regeringsform för Finland; Law no. 94/1919). 16.Four years later, on 19 March 1997, the request was rejected by the Kuopio County Administrative Board. It reasoned: “The civil servants of the former Sonkajärvi Police District ... have ... requested compensation for the losses arising from the incorporation of police districts, in response to which the Provincial Police Command, endorsing the request, submitted documents to the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior. By a letter of 25March 1991, the Ministry of the Interior recommended to the Ministry of Finance the retroactive payment from 1 November 1990 of individual wage supplements to those civil servants whose duty station, after the incorporation, is Iisalmi. By a letter of 3 July 1991, [the Ministry of Finance] informed the Ministry of the Interior that it had found that it could not grant the request. Following the [Ministry of Finance’s] decision, competence to decide on individual wage supplements was transferred to the County Administrative Boards. On 28January 1993, in a negotiation meeting held by the Provincial Police Command at which the applicants were represented by Mr Lappalainen, it was noted that negotiations were pending with regard to the Askola Police District in , which was a corresponding case. As [the Ministry of Finance], which had the relevant competence, had already decided the claims concerning the Sonkajärvi Police District, it was concluded that, on grounds of fairness, the decision in Uusimaa would be adhered to in Kuopio County were it to depart from the view of the Ministry of Finance. The Uusimaa County Administrative Board rejected the application and the decision was upheld by the . No new grounds have been presented in the letter of 19 March 1993, or in Mr Pallonen’s [further and] separate claim of 17 August 1994, to support the claims which have already been decided [by the Ministry of Finance]. The County Administrative Board has not learned of any positive decisions regarding compensation in corresponding cases as regards the incorporation of police districts anywhere in the country following the above-mentioned [Ministry of Finance’s] decision. In 1990, when the incorporation took place, the Provincial Police Command lacked competence to make any binding promises as regards the compensation of costs. Its view had been shown through its support of the application. The County Administrative Board, using its discretion and basing itself on the earlier decision by the competent authority, considers that the decision has acquired a certain res judicata effect. Emphasising the principles of equality and fairness, the County Administrative Board also bases itself on the prevalent practice throughout the country.” 17.Meanwhile, in December 1996 one of the applicants lodged a complaint with the Chancellor of Justice (oikeuskansleri, justitiekanslern) who, in his decision of 24 January 1997, drew attention to the fact that the applicants had still not received any answer to their application. 18.On 25 April 1997 the applicants appealed against the County Administrative Board’s decision and requested an oral hearing which, they asserted, would make it possible to establish the facts of the case, in particular that a promise had been made by the Provincial Police Command. The Kuopio County Administrative Court (lääninoikeus, länsrätten) received replies to the appeal from the Provincial Police Command and the Provincial State Attorney (lääninasiamies, länsombudet), and these were communicated to the applicants for comment. 19.By a decision of 8 June 1998, the reasoned: “Rectification of wage increases affecting pensions falls outside the ’s competence. It is not necessary to receive oral testimony from the parties as regards the Provincial Police Command of the County Administrative Board’s promises concerning the incorporation of police districts, or on how the case has been otherwise handled, in order to clarify the case. In its letter of 25 March 1991, the Ministry of the Interior proposed to the Ministry of Finance that the Sonkajärvi Police District be incorporated into the Iisalmi Police District from 1 November 1990 [in fact, the Ministry of the Interior recommended payment, not incorporation] and that the inconvenience caused by the change of duty station be compensated in the form of a wage supplement of FIM 500 to 700 per month, retroactively from 1 November 1990. In its letter of 3 July 1991, the Ministry of Finance considered that it could not grant the request. Negotiations were held between the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior and the Police Association [Suomen Poliisiliitto ry] on 3 September 1992 and between the Provincial Police Command of the Kuopio County Administrative Board and the applicants’ representative on 28 January 1993. Pursuant to Article 9 § 2 of the State Collective Agreement Decree (as amended on 18 September 1992), the County Administrative Board has competence to decide on wage supplements in respect of ... civil servants in the local police forces. The County Administrative Board must be considered to have examined the applicants’ ... submission dated 19 March 1993 as a rectification request, referred to in section 84 of the State Civil Servants Act. The rectification request has been lodged within the time laid down by section 95(1) of the State Civil Servants Act, if calculated from the Ministry of Finance’s decision of 3 July 1991. In 1990 the Provincial Police Command of the County Administrative Board lacked competence to give any binding promises pertaining to compensation. Competence to decide the matter lay at that time with the Ministry of Finance, which in its letter of 3July 1991 had stated that it considered that it could not accede to the request. Since 1 October 1992 the County Administrative Board has had competence to decide on the wages of local police. The County Administrative Board has in its decision, subject to appeal, based itself on the decision by the former competent authority and on the fact that after 3 July 1991 no compensation had been awarded to personnel in other cases in which incorporation had taken place. The decision is therefore based on the prevalent practice at that time in the entire country. The decision cannot be considered unreasonable in those circumstances. It has been possible to dismiss the request for rectification.” 20.On 7 July 1998 the applicants appealed further, requesting an oral hearing and emphasising that similar wage supplements had been granted to personnel from other police districts in corresponding situations. They relied, for example, on a decision of 10 January 1997 by the Pohjois-Karjala County Administrative Board, granting a police officer an individual wage supplement from 1 December 1996 following incorporation of the Valtimo Police District into the Nurmes Police District. 21.On 27 April 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen), having received observations from the Provincial Police Command and the Provincial State Attorney and having communicated them to the applicants for comment, upheld the lower court’s decision. It reasoned: “The has examined the case. The promises made by the Provincial Police Command of the Kuopio County Administrative Board as regards compensation for costs arising from the incorporation of police districts have no legal relevance to the case. Thus, the holding of an oral hearing is manifestly unnecessary. Accordingly, the , having regard to section 38(1) of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act, refuses [the appellants’] request for an oral hearing. In their letter of 19 March 1993, [the appellants] requested compensation in the form of individual wage supplements of costs arising from the incorporation of their police district. On 1 October 1992 competence to decide on wages in respect of local police forces was transferred to the County Administrative Board pursuant to section 9(2) of the State Collective Agreement Decree (as amended on 18 September 1992). [The appellants] have no statutory right to the individual wage supplement in question. The Kuopio County Administrative Board has not overstepped its margin of appreciation. The County Administrative Board’s decision is not in breach of the law. Therefore, the , having regard to section 7(1) of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act, finds that there is no reason to amend the outcome of the County Administrative Board’s decision, which accordingly remains final.” 22.The implementing instruction of 26 April 1988 on the application of the collective agreement with regard to the payment of a cold-area allowance to civil servants provided: “A civil servant working (before 29 February 1988) in a municipality not covered by the new collective agreement is entitled to an individual wage supplement ... as long as he or she is working in the municipality giving rise to an entitlement to such an allowance. Where a civil servant entitled to an individual wage supplement is ordered, temporarily or as a substitute, to perform the duties of another civil servant, or where his or her duty station is transferred to a municipality in which the previous remote-area allowance has not been paid, the said civil servant will not be paid the individual wage supplement during the period he or she is performing those other duties because, in order to receive the wage supplement, the civil servant has to perform his or her duties in a municipality giving rise to entitlement to the wage supplement.” According to the applicants, this instruction was not relevant to the present case, in that it allegedly concerned only temporary transfers, whereas the transfer of the applicants’ place of duty had been of a permanent nature. 23.In its request of 25 March 1991, the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior referred to an allegedly analogous case in which the Ministry of Finance had on 29 December 1989 granted a request for individual wage supplements following the incorporation of the Pertunmaa Police District into that of the Mäntyharju Police District (the Mäntyharju case). 24.On 3 July 1991 the Ministry of Finance refused a request for compensation for commuting costs lodged by a civil servant whose duty station had changed following the incorporation of the Askola Police District into that of the Mäntsälä and Porvoo Police District. The decision was upheld by the Uusimaa County Administrative Board and the on 7 April 1993 and 7 December 1994 respectively. 25.By a decision of 10 January 1997, the Pohjois-Karjala County Administrative Board granted a police officer a cold-area allowance at level1 plus an individual wage supplement compensating for the difference between level 2 (Valtimo) and level 1 (Nurmes) of the cold-area allowance following the incorporation of the Valtimo Police District into the Nurmes Police District (the Nurmes case). 26.Section 38(1) of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act (hallintolainkäyttölaki, förvaltningsprocesslagen; Law no. 586/1996) provides that an oral hearing must be held if requested by a private party. An oral hearing may however be dispensed with if a party’s request is ruled inadmissible or immediately dismissed or if an oral hearing would be clearly unnecessary due to the nature of the case or other circumstances. 27.The explanatory report on the Government Bill (no. 217/1995) for the enactment of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act examines the right to an oral hearing as provided by Article 6 of the Convention and the possibility in administrative matters to dispense with the hearing when it would be clearly unnecessary, as stated in section 38(1) of the said Act. It notes that an oral hearing contributes to a focused and immediate procedure but since it does not always bring any added value, it must be ensured that the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the administrative procedure is not undermined. An oral hearing is to be held when it is necessary for the clarification of the issues and the hearing can be considered beneficial for the case as a whole. 28.The international law and practice from which the Court sought guidance in Pellegrin v. France ([GC], no. 28541/95, ECHR 1999VIII) has been outlined in that judgment (see §§ 37-41). 29.Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, proclaimed on 7 December 2000, on the right to an effective remedy and a fair trial, provides: “Everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the Union are violated has the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal in compliance with the conditions laid down in this Article. Everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal previously established by law. Everyone shall have the possibility of being advised, defended and represented. Legal aid shall be made available to those who lack sufficient resources in so far as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice.” 30.The Explanations relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, originally prepared under the authority of the Praesidium of the Convention which drafted the Charter and finally integrated in the Final Act of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, do not have equal authority to the Charter. However, they are a “valuable tool of interpretation intended to clarify the provisions of the Charter”. They read as follows (extract): “The second paragraph [of Article 47] corresponds to Article 6(1) of the ECHR which reads as follows: In Union law, the right to a fair hearing is not confined to disputes relating to civil law rights and obligations. That is one of the consequences of the fact that the Union is a community based on the rule of law as stated by the Court in Case 294/83, ‘Les Verts’ v. European Parliament (judgment of 23 April 1986, [1988] ECR 1339). Nevertheless, in all respects other than their scope, the guarantees afforded by the ECHR apply in a similar way to the Union.” It follows that Article 47, in the context of European Union law, is not confined to civil rights and obligations or to criminal matters within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. In this respect the Charter codified existing case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities (see Marguerite Johnston v. Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Case 222/84, [1986] ECR 1651, referred to in paragraph 60 below).",2007,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

48,001-72931,Grand Chamber,"12.The applicant was born in 1923 and lives in . 13.On 21 May 1986 Mr P. brought proceedings against the applicant in the Chiaravalle Centrale Magistrate’s Court for recognition of the existence of a right of way. 14.Preparation of the case for trial began on 28 May 1986 and on that date the Magistrate’s Court appointed an expert. Of the seven hearings listed between 8 October 1986 and 2 December 1987 three were devoted to organising expert evidence, two to an inspection of the premises by the pretore, two were adjourned by the court of its own motion and one was adjourned because the lawyers were on strike. On 27 July 1988 the Magistrate’s Court set the case down for hearing of oral submissions on 1March 1989. On that date the hearing was adjourned to 5 July 1989 at the parties’ request. Of the fifteen hearings listed between 2 May 1991 and 4June 1997 six were adjourned at the parties’ request, two at the request of the defendant, five by the court of its own motion – one of which was because the registry had not notified the applicant of the date of the hearing – one because the applicant had changed lawyer and another one to allow the registry to check that the stamps had duly been affixed to a number of documents in the case file. Judgment was reserved on 22October 1997. 15.In an order of 26 November 1997, which was not made at a hearing, the court declared the case reopened and requested the parties to file documents with the registry. On 4 March 1998 the court reserved judgment. 16. In an order of 9 April 1998 the court declared the case reopened, noted that the parties had not yet filed the documents requested and adjourned the case to 7 October 1998. On that date judgment was reserved. 17.In a judgment of the same date, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 16 August 1999, the Magistrate’s Court granted Mr P.’s application. 18.On 27 October 2000 the applicant appealed to the Catanzaro Court of Appeal. According to information provided by the applicant on 6 June 2005, the first hearing, which was to be held on 22 January 2001, was not held until 10 December 2001 following two adjournments of the court’s own motion and an adjournment of a hearing because the registry had not notified the parties of the hearing date. The parties made their submissions two hearings later, on 27 May 2002, and the hearing of final submissions was set down for 9 December 2003. That hearing was adjourned to 6 July 2004 following the transfer of the judge directing the preparations for trial, then to 18 January 2005. On that date judgment was reserved. 19.In a judgment of 21 February 2005, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 18 March 2005, the Court of Appeal set aside the first-instance court’s judgment and allowed the applicant’s appeal. According to information provided by the applicant on 14 October 2005, as the judgment had not been served the time allowed for appealing to the Court of Cassation was still running. 20.On an unspecified date in April 2002 the applicant lodged an application with the Salerno Court of Appeal under Law no.89 of 24March2001, known as the “Pinto Act”, complaining of the length of the above-described proceedings. He requested the court to rule that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to order the to pay compensation for the distress and other non-pecuniary damage sustained. The applicant claimed 13,000 euros (EUR) in compensation for distress and other non-pecuniary damage, and sought reimbursement of the costs and expenses but did not quantify them. 21.In a decision of 1 October 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 13 December 2002, the Court of Appeal found that the length of the proceedings had been excessive. It held as follows: The Court of Appeal awarded the applicant EUR3,500 on an equitable basis in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. In respect of costs and expenses, the Court of Appeal noted that the applicant had not given particulars of the claim. Having regard to the quantity and quality of the work done by the lawyer, it awarded him only half the sum he had considered due EUR516.46 (that is, EUR258.23) plus tax. That decision became final by 28January 2004 at the latest. The applicant obtained payment of the amounts due from the authorities on 19 November 2004. 22.In a letter of 20 October 2003 the applicant informed the Court of the outcome of the domestic proceedings and asked it to resume its examination of his application. 23.In a letter of 18 November 2003 the applicant informed the Court that he did not intend to appeal to the Court of Cassation because an appeal to that court could only be on points of law. 24.Award of just satisfaction in the event of a breach of the requirement to dispose of proceedings within a reasonable time and amendment to Article 375 of the Code of Civil Procedure Section 4 Time-limits and procedures for lodging applications Section 5 Communications Section 6 Transitional provisions Section 7 Financial provisions 25.On appeal from decisions delivered by the courts of appeal in “Pinto” proceedings, the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court (Sezioni Unite), gave four judgments (nos. 1338, 1339, 1340 and 1341) on 27November 2003, the texts of which were deposited with the registry on 26January 2004, quashing the appeal court’s decision and remitting the case for a rehearing. It held that “the case-law of the is binding on the Italian courts regarding the application of Law no. 89/2001”. In its judgment no. 1340 it affirmed, inter alia, the principle that 26.Extracts from the plenary Court of Cassation’s judgment no.1339 deposited with the registry on 26 January 2004>Case-law on the transfer of the right to compensation 27.The Court of Cassation held as follows: 28.The Court of Cassation judges noted that the right to compensation for a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time derived from the Pinto Act. The mechanism set in place by the European standard did not give applicants a cause of action before the domestic courts. Accordingly, the right to “just satisfaction” could neither be acquired nor transferred by a person who had already died by the time the Pinto Act came into force. The fact that the deceased had, while alive, lodged an application with the was not decisive. Section 6 of the Pinto Act did not constitute, as the applicants had maintained, a procedural standard bringing about a transfer of powers from the to the domestic courts. 29.In this case, which concerned the possibility or otherwise of transferring to heirs the right to compensation deriving from a breach of Article 6 § 1 on account of the length of the proceedings, the First Division of the Court of Cassation referred the case to the full court indicating that there was a conflict between the case-law authorities, that is, between the restrictive approach taken by the Court of Cassation in the earlier judgments regarding heirs and the Pinto Act and the four judgments delivered by the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, on 26 January 2004 to the extent that a less strict interpretation would lead to the conclusion that this right to compensation has existed since Italy ratified the European Convention on 4 August 1955. 30.In the case giving rise to the order mentioned above referring the case to the full court (see preceding paragraph), the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, established the following principles, thus preventing any further conflicting decisions being given by the courts: (i) Law no.848 of 4 August 1955, which ratified the Convention and made it enforceable, introduced into domestic legal order the fundamental rights, belonging to the category of rights conferred on the individual by public law, provided for in the first section of the Convention and which correspond to a large extent with those set forth in Article 2 of the Constitution. In that respect the Convention provisions are confirmatory and illustrative. ... (ii) It is necessary to reiterate the principle that the act giving rise to the right to reparation conferred by domestic law corresponds to a breach of the provision in Article 6 of the Convention, which is immediately applicable in domestic law. The distinction between the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, introduced by the European Convention on Human Rights (or even pre-existing as a constitutionally protected value), and the right to equitable reparation, which was allegedly introduced only by the Pinto Act, cannot be allowed in so far as the protection provided by the domestic courts does not depart from that previously offered by the Strasbourg Court, the domestic courts being bound to comply with the case-law of the European Court. ... (iii) Accordingly, the right to equitable reparation for loss sustained as a result of the unreasonable length of proceedings prior to the entry into force of Law no. 89/2001 must be acknowledged by the domestic courts even in favour of the heirs of a party who introduced the proceedings before that date, subject only to the condition that the claim has not already been lodged with the Strasbourg Court and the Court has not ruled on admissibility. ... 31.This judgment of the Court of Cassation concerned an appeal by the Ministry of Justice challenging the Court of Appeal’s award of non-pecuniary damages to a juristic person. The Court of Cassation referred to the decision reached in the case of Comingersoll v. Portugal [GC], no.35382/97, ECHR 2000IV and, after referring to the four judgments of the full court delivered on 26 January 2004, found that its own case-law was not in line with the European Court. It held that there was no legal barrier to awarding just satisfaction to “juristic” persons according to the criteria of the . Accordingly, since the Court of Appeal had correctly decided the case the appeal was dismissed. 32.The Court of Cassation made the following observations: 33.In the report CM/Inf/DH(2004)23, revised on 24 September 2004, the Ministers’ deputies made the following indications regarding an assessment of the Pinto remedy: 34.In this interim resolution the Ministers’ deputies indicated as follows: “The Committee of Ministers Noting ... 35.The European Commission for the efficiency of justice was set up at the Council of Europe by Resolution Res(2002)12 with the aim of (a) improving the efficiency and the functioning of the justice of member States with a view to ensuring that everyone within their jurisdiction can enforce their legal rights effectively, thereby generating increased confidence of the citizens in the justice system and (b) enabling a better implementation of the international legal instruments of the Council of Europe concerning efficiency and fairness of justice. 36.In its framework programme (CEPEJ (2004) 19 Rev 2 § (7) the CEPEJ noted that “the mechanisms which are limited to compensation are too weak and do not adequately incite the States to modify their operational process, and provide compensation only a posteriori in the event of a proven violation instead of trying to find a solution for the problem of delays.”",2006,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

86,001-72629,Grand Chamber,"10.The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Hamburg (). 11.On 8 September 1992 Mr S. was fatally injured by a shot fired at a travellers' encampment (campo nomadi) in . The initial statements taken by the police from witnesses indicated that the applicant had been responsible for the killing. 12.On 15 October 1992 the investigating judge made an order for the applicant's detention pending trial. However, the order could not be enforced as the applicant had become untraceable. As a result, the Italian authorities considered that he had deliberately sought to evade justice and on 14 November 1992 declared him to be a “fugitive” (latitante). The applicant was identified as Cloce (or Kroce) Sejdovic (or Sajdovic), probably born in on 5 August 1972, the son of Jusuf Sejdovic (or Sajdovic) and the brother of Zaim (ou Zain) Sejdovic (or Sajdovic). 13.As the Italian authorities had not managed to contact the applicant to invite him to choose his own defence counsel, they assigned him a lawyer, who was informed that his client and four other persons had been committed for trial on a specified date in the Rome Assize Court. 14.The lawyer took part in the trial, but the applicant was absent. 15.In a judgment of 2 July 1996, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 30 September 1996, the convicted the applicant of murder and illegally carrying a weapon and sentenced him to twenty-one years and eight months' imprisonment. One of the applicant's fellow defendants was sentenced to fifteen years and eight months' imprisonment for the same offences, while the other three were acquitted. 16.The applicant's lawyer was informed that the 's judgment had been deposited with the registry. He did not appeal. The applicant's conviction accordingly became final on 22 January 1997. 17.On 22 September 1999 the applicant was arrested in Hamburg by the German police under an arrest warrant issued by the public prosecutor's office. On 30 September 1999 the Italian Minister of Justice requested the applicant's extradition. He added that, once he had been extradited to , the applicant would be entitled to apply under Article175 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for leave to appeal out of time against the 's judgment. 18.At the request of the German authorities, the public prosecutor's office stated that it did not appear from the evidence that the applicant had been officially notified of the charges against him. The public prosecutor's office was unable to say whether the applicant had contacted the lawyer assigned to represent him. In any event, the lawyer had attended the trial and had played an active role in conducting his client's defence, having called a large number of witnesses. Furthermore, the had clearly established that the applicant, who had been identified by numerous witnesses as Mr S.'s killer, was guilty. In the opinion of the public prosecutor's office, the applicant had absconded immediately after Mr S.'s death precisely to avoid being arrested and tried. Lastly, the public prosecutor's office stated: “A person who is to be extradited may seek leave to appeal against the judgment. However, for a court to agree to re-examine the case it has to be proved that the accused was wrongly deemed to be a 'fugitive'. To sum up, a new trial, even in the form of an appeal (during which new evidence may be submitted), is not granted automatically.” 19.On 6 December 1999 the German authorities refused the Italian government's extradition request on the ground that the requesting country's domestic legislation did not guarantee with sufficient certainty that the applicant would have the opportunity of having his trial reopened. 20.In the meantime, the applicant had been released on 22 November 1999. He has never lodged an objection to execution (incidente d'esecuzione) or an application for leave to appeal out of time (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below) in . 21.The validity of a conviction may be contested by means of an objection to execution under Article 670 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”), the relevant parts of which provide: “Where the judge supervising enforcement establishes that a judgment is invalid or has not become enforceable, he shall, [after] assessing on the merits [nel merito] whether the safeguards in place for a convicted person deemed to be untraceable have been observed, ... suspend its enforcement, ordering, where necessary, that the person be released and that defects in the service of process be remedied. In such cases the time allowed for appealing shall begin to run again.” 22.Article 175 §§ 2 and 3 of the CCP provides for the possibility of applying for leave to appeal out of time. The relevant parts of that provision were worded as follows at the time of the applicant's arrest: “In the event of conviction in absentia ..., the defendant may request the reopening of the time allowed for appeal against the judgment where he can establish that he had no effective knowledge [effettiva conoscenza] [of it] ... [and] on condition that no appeal has been lodged by his lawyer and there has been no negligence on his part or, in the case of a conviction in absentia having been served ... on his lawyer ..., that he did not deliberately refuse to take cognisance of the procedural steps. A request for the reopening of the time allowed for appeal must be lodged within ten days of the date ... on which the defendant learned [of the judgment], failing which it shall be declared inadmissible.” 23.When called upon to interpret this provision, the Court of Cassation has held that the rejection of an application for leave to appeal out of time cannot be justified by mere negligence or lack of interest on the defendant's part but that, on the contrary, there must have been “intentional conduct designed to avoid taking cognisance of the procedural steps” (see the First Section's judgment of 6 March 2000 (no. 1671) in Collini, and also the Court of Cassation's judgment no. 5808/1999). More specifically, where a judgment has been served on the accused in person, the accused must prove that he or she was unaware of it and that there has been no negligence on his or her part; however, where the judgment has been served on an absent defendant's lawyer, it is for the court to establish whether the defendant deliberately avoided taking cognisance of the relevant steps (see the Second Section's judgment of 29 January 2003 (no. 18107) in Bylyshi, where the Court of Cassation set aside an order in which the Genoa Court of Appeal had held that negligence could only be due to the wish not to receive any information, thereby treating negligent conduct as intentional without giving any arguments in support of that position). 24.In its judgment of 25 November 2004 (no. 48738) in Soldati, the Court of Cassation (First Section) observed that leave to appeal out of time could be granted on two conditions: if the accused had not had any knowledge of the proceedings and if he or she had not deliberately avoided taking cognisance of the procedural steps. It was for the convicted person to prove that the first condition was satisfied, whereas the burden of proof in respect of the second lay with the “representative of the prosecution or with the court”. Accordingly, a lack of evidence as regards the second condition could only work to the defendant's advantage. The Court of Cassation accordingly held that, before declaring defendants to be “fugitives”, the authorities should not only search for them in a manner appropriate to the circumstances of the case but should also establish whether they had intentionally avoided complying with a measure ordered by the court, such as a measure entailing deprivation of liberty (see the First Section's judgment of 23 February 2005 (no. 6987) in Flordelis and Pagnanelli). 25.On 22 April 2005 Parliament approved Law no. 60/2005, by which Legislative Decree no. 17 of 21 February 2005 became statute. Law no.60/2005 was published in Official Gazette (Gazzetta ufficiale) no. 94 of 23 April 2005. It came into force the following day. 26.Law no. 60/2005 amended Article 175 of the CCP. The new version of paragraph 2 reads as follows: “In the event of conviction in absentia ... the time allowed for appeal against the judgment shall be reopened, on an application by the defendant, unless he had effective knowledge [effettiva conoscenza] of the proceedings [against him] or of the judgment [provvedimento] and has deliberately refused to appear or to appeal against the judgment. The judicial authorities shall carry out all necessary checks to that end.” 27.Law no. 60/2005 also added a paragraph 2 bis to Article 175 of the CCP, worded as follows: “An application referred to in paragraph 2 above must be lodged within thirty days of the date on which the defendant had effective knowledge of the judgment, failing which it shall be declared inadmissible. In the event of extradition from another country, the time allowed for making such an application shall run from the point at which the defendant is handed over [to the Italian authorities] ...” 28.In Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 on the re-examination or reopening of certain cases at domestic level following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe encouraged the Contracting Parties “to examine their national legal systems with a view to ensuring that there exist adequate possibilities of re-examination of the case, including reopening of proceedings, in instances where the Court has found a violation of the Convention, especially where: (i) the injured party continues to suffer very serious negative consequences because of the outcome of the domestic decision at issue, which are not adequately remedied by the just satisfaction and cannot be rectified except by re-examination or reopening, and (ii) the judgment of the Court leads to the conclusion that (a) the impugned domestic decision is on the merits contrary to the Convention, or (b) the violation found is based on procedural errors or shortcomings of such gravity that a serious doubt is cast on the outcome of the domestic proceedings complained of.”",2006,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

"
125,001-67226,Grand Chamber,"12.The first applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Woking. 13.On 9 August 1994, following a surveillance and undercover operation, he was arrested in a van in the company of an undercover police officer known only as “Graham”. In the van was a briefcase containing 4.83kilograms of 50% pure heroin. On 7 April 1995 the applicant was convicted in Snaresbrook Crown Court of possessing a Class A drug with intent to supply and was sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment. 14.The first applicant’s defence was that at the time of his arrest he believed he was taking part in a transaction to sell stolen jewellery. He alleged that his participation had been organised by a man named GeoffreyLerway, whom he had met the previous year while both were detained on remand in Brixton Prison. According to the applicant, the week before his arrest Lerway had introduced him to a man called Jim Humphries and a man introduced to him only as “Martin”. The day before the arrest, the applicant was contacted by Lerway and asked if he would be interested in going to in connection with a jewellery deal in which Lerway was acting as intermediary to Martin. He would be given a cut of the purchase price. The applicant agreed that Lerway would pick him up from his home the next day. 15.The following morning he was told that the plans had changed, as Martin was now coming to . The first applicant agreed to accompany Lerway to a public house where, at approximately 12.45 p.m., a red Jaguar and a white van drew up. The driver of the Jaguar was introduced to the applicant as “Jeff”; he was accompanied by a man and a woman, subsequently addressed as “Terry” and “Carol”. The driver of the van was introduced as “Graham”. Jeff gave Lerway a briefcase containing 125,000pounds sterling (GBP). They all then left in convoy for the , Primrose Hill, where they were to meet Martin. 16.At the hotel, Lerway decided to stay with the money in the car and asked the applicant to see if Martin had arrived. The applicant therefore went into the hotel where he met Jim Humphries, who told him that the arrangements had changed again as Martin was now in Euston. Humphries and Lerway asked the applicant to take a taxi to Euston and ask Martin to return with him to the . The applicant followed these instructions and found Martin, who told him he had to leave immediately for another meeting. Martin, having spoken to Humphries or Lerway on a mobile phone, gave the applicant the key to a room in the nearby Ibis Hotel, and explained that the “goods” were in a briefcase in the room. 17.According to the applicant, Graham came from Primrose Hill in his van and met the applicant outside the Ibis Hotel. Graham then suggested that the applicant should accompany him up to the room and offered to give him a lift back to Primrose Hill afterwards. In the hotel room, Graham forced the lock on the case while the applicant was in the bathroom, and when he came out Graham was ready to go. They returned to the van, where the briefcase was opened, and within moments the applicant was arrested. 18.Of all the participants in the above transaction, only the applicant was arrested and charged. The applicant suspects that the other participants were undercover police officers or informers acting on police instructions, but their identities and status have never been revealed to him. In this regard, he considers it relevant that, at the time of the alleged dealings, Lerway was on bail to the Middlesex Crown Court in respect of a large-scale conspiracy to supply cannabis. One of the conspirators was a former Flying Squad detective. It was known to the applicant that Lerway had acted as a participating police informer in that case and it was further known that the police officers involved in the applicant’s case had also investigated the conspiracy for which Lerway was on bail. The applicant believes that sentencing in Lerway’s trial was deliberately postponed until 12 April 1995, some five days after the conclusion of the applicant’s own trial, as a disincentive for Lerway to come forward and give evidence concerning the true nature of the transaction. 19.Prior to the commencement of the applicant’s trial, the prosecution gave notice to the defence that an application to withhold material evidence had been made ex parte in advance of the trial under the procedure approved in R. v. Davis, Johnson and Rowe (see paragraph 37 below). Judge Owen Stable QC, who considered the material in the absence of the defence, concluded that it would not assist the defence and that there were genuine public interest grounds for withholding it. This ruling was subsequently reconsidered by the trial judge, who had the benefit of a document prepared by the defence outlining the issues in the case, as well as of the oral submissions of defence counsel. In the course of the proceedings before the Chamber, the Government revealed for the first time that the material placed before the trial judge had included information indicating that the applicant had been involved in the supply of heroin before the start of the undercover operation. The subject matter of the public interest immunity evidence was not disclosed to the applicant during the domestic proceedings, either at first instance or on appeal. The trial judge, who directed himself in accordance with the approach set out by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Keane (see paragraph 39 below), decided that the evidence in question would not assist the defence and found genuine public interest grounds in favour of non-disclosure. 20.Following the ruling on disclosure, the defence made an application to the trial judge under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE – see paragraph 32 below) to exclude the evidence of Graham, on the basis that the applicant had been entrapped into committing the offence. These submissions were rejected. The judge held that in the course of the ex parte application he had heard nothing and seen no material which would have assisted the defence in their argument that evidence should be excluded under section 78 on grounds of entrapment. He continued that, if he had seen or heard any such material, he would have ordered disclosure. 21.Apart from the applicant, Graham was the only participant in the offence to give evidence at the trial. He testified that the applicant had made a number of incriminating statements to him when they were alone together in the van and hotel room. Although Graham claimed to have made a full note of the alleged conversations, these notes were never shown to the applicant and the applicant was not questioned in connection with their content by the investigating police officers. According to the applicant, it was, however, difficult for the defence to undermine Graham’s credibility because his full name and other identifying details were not disclosed. 22.Following his conviction, the applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground, inter alia, that the judge had been wrong to refuse to order disclosure. Dismissing the appeal on 18 July 1996, the Court of Appeal, having itself examined the undisclosed evidence, observed that “each one of us reached the clearest possible view that nothing in the documents withheld could possibly have assisted the defence at trial; indeed quite the reverse”. 23.The second applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Tonbridge. Prior to the events in question, he had been of good character and employed as accounts director in a firm which had gone into liquidation a year earlier. At the time of his arrest in July 1995, he was unemployed and in considerable debt. 24.The applicant’s version of events, which he maintained from the time of his first interview with the police, was that he had been introduced to a man named “Terry” by an acquaintance, Colin Phelps, since Terry appeared interested in purchasing from the applicant some bankrupt stock. At a meeting in July 1995, Terry had started talking about counterfeit currency and had pressed the applicant to obtain some as part of the transaction. Although the applicant had never hitherto been involved with counterfeit currency, he did have a contact, “John”, who was able to supply forged banknotes. 25.Terry went on to introduce the applicant to two men called “Jag” and “Jazz”. At a third meeting on 14 July 1995, Jag turned up with “Chris”, who was subsequently revealed to be an undercover police officer, and an order for a large amount of currency was placed. It appears from the transcript of covert tape recordings made during this meeting that, while the applicant was not unwilling to become involved, he was actively encouraged to do so by Jag and Chris, who put a certain amount of pressure on him to supply more notes of a higher denomination than had at first been agreed. On 25July 1995 the applicant met Chris and another undercover officer, “Ian”, in a public house car park. He showed them some counterfeit notes, and was immediately arrested by uniformed officers. More counterfeit notes were found when his house was searched. 26.The applicant maintained that he had been entrapped by undercover police officers and/or participating informers into committing the offences. On 11 November 1996 he applied to the Crown Court judge for an order that the indictment should be stayed on the grounds that, as a result of the covert activities of undercover police officers and/or participating informers, (a) it was not possible for him to have a fair trial and (b) the moral integrity of the criminal proceedings had been impaired. He also requested the judge to order the prosecution to provide more information and documents, including information relating to the question whether Colin Phelps, Terry or “Tel”, Jazz or Jag were participating informers or undercover police officers. 27.Prior to making his ruling on the defence application, the judge heard, ex parte, an application by the prosecution to withhold certain material evidence on grounds of public interest immunity. The judge refused to grant a stay or to order further disclosure, indicating that most of the information sought was subject to public interest immunity. He also ruled that, while it was clear that Chris had been coaxing the applicant, there was no evidence of pressure having been applied. 28.A second submission was then made on the applicant’s behalf to exclude the evidence of undercover police officers under section 78 of PACE. However, before evidence was called from the officers in question – Chris and Ian –defence counsel sought guidance from the judge as to the areas of cross-examination which would or would not be allowed, given that certain issues relating to the investigation were covered by public interest immunity. It became apparent that most of the areas of cross-examination necessary to develop the submission were not to be allowed. Accordingly, the submission was withdrawn and the applicant entered guilty pleas to the indictment on 12 November 1996. 29.On 20 November 1996 he was sentenced to a total of four and a half years’ imprisonment. 30.On 28 November 1996 counsel advised that the applicant had no prospects of success in appealing against conviction, since he would have to demonstrate that the convictions were unsafe before an appeal could succeed. This would be impossible given that, on his own account, he had been motivated by money to enter into the deal to sell counterfeit currency. Counsel also expressed the view that: “Had there been anything within the [public interest immunity] material which could have assisted the Defendant in developing his case to exclude the evidence under s.78 PACE I am confident the Judge would have released it. In those circumstances, I advise that there are no grounds of appeal against conviction.” 31.The fact that a defendant would not have committed an offence were it not for the activity of an undercover police officer or an informer acting on police instructions does not provide a defence under English law. The judge does, however, have a discretion to order a stay of a prosecution where it appears that entrapment has occurred, as the House of Lords affirmed in R. v. Looseley; Attorney-General’s Reference (no. 3 of 2000) ([2001] United Kingdom House of Lords Decisions 53), a judgment which followed and approved earlier case-law, including case-law which applied at the time of the applicants’ trials (for example, the judgment of the House of Lords in R. v. Latif [1996] 1 Weekly Law Reports 104). In Looseley, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead explained (§ 1): “My Lords, every court has an inherent power and duty to prevent abuse of its process. This is a fundamental principle of the rule of law. By recourse to this principle courts ensure that executive agents of the State do not misuse the coercive, law-enforcement functions of the courts and thereby oppress citizens of the State. Entrapment ... is an instance where such misuse may occur. It is simply not acceptable that the State through its agents should lure its citizens into committing acts forbidden by the law and then seek to prosecute them for doing so. That would be entrapment. That would be a misuse of State power, and an abuse of the process of the courts. The unattractive consequences, frightening and sinister in extreme cases, which State conduct of this nature could have are obvious. The role of the courts is to stand between the State and its citizens and make sure this does not happen.” 32.In addition, the court has a discretion, under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, to exclude evidence obtained by an undercover police officer where, inter alia, the defendant would not have committed the offence without police incitement (see R. v. Smurthwaite; R.v. Gill (1994) 98 Criminal Appeal Reports 437, judgment of the Court of Appeal; and Looseley, cited above). Of the two remedies, the grant of a stay, rather than the exclusion of evidence, is the more appropriate remedy because a prosecution founded on entrapment is an abuse of the court’s process and should not have been brought in the first place. 33.In Looseley, the House of Lords agreed that it was not possible to set out a comprehensive definition of unacceptable police conduct or “State-created crime”. In each case it was for the judge, having regard to all the circumstances, to decide whether the conduct of the police or other law-enforcement agency was so seriously improper as to bring the administration of justice into question. Factors to be taken into account included the nature of the offence, the reason for the particular police operation, the possibility of using other methods of detection and the nature and extent of police participation in the crime; the greater the inducement offered by the police, and the more forceful and persistent the police overtures, the more readily a court might conclude that the police had overstepped the boundary, since their conduct might well have brought about the commission of a crime by a person who would normally avoid crime of that kind. The police should act in good faith to uncover evidence of criminal acts which they reasonably suspected the accused was about to commit or was already engaged in committing, and the police operation should be properly supervised. The defendant’s criminal record was unlikely to be relevant unless it could be linked to other factors grounding reasonable suspicion that he or she had been engaged in the criminal activity in question prior to the involvement of the police (per Lord Nicholls, §§2629; Lord Hoffmann, §§ 50-71). 34.At common law, the prosecution has a duty to disclose any material which has or might have some bearing on the offence charged. This duty extends to any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial and statements of any witnesses potentially favourable to the defence. 35.In December 1981 the Attorney-General issued guidelines, which did not have force of law, concerning exceptions to the common-law duty to disclose to the defence evidence of potential assistance to it ((1982) 74 Criminal Appeal Reports 302 – “the Guidelines”)). According to the Guidelines, the duty to disclose was subject to a discretionary power for prosecuting counsel to withhold relevant evidence if it fell within one of the categories set out in paragraph 6. One of these categories (6(iv)) was “sensitive” material which, because of its sensitivity, it would not be in the public interest to disclose. “Sensitive material” was defined as follows: “... (a) it deals with matters of national security; or it is by, or discloses the identity of, a member of the Security Services who would be of no further use to those services once his identity became known; (b) it is by, or discloses the identity of, an informant and there are reasons for fearing that the disclosure of his identity would put him or his family in danger; (c) it is by, or discloses the identity of, a witness who might be in danger of assault or intimidation if his identity became known; (d) it contains details which, if they became known, might facilitate the commission of other offences or alert someone not in custody that he is a suspect; or it discloses some unusual form of surveillance or method of detecting crime; (e) it is supplied only on condition that the contents will not be disclosed, at least until a subpoena has been served upon the supplier – e.g. a bank official; (f) it relates to other offences by, or serious allegations against, someone who is not an accused, or discloses previous convictions or other matters prejudicial to him; (g) it contains details of private delicacy to the maker and/or might create risk of domestic strife.” 36.In R. v. Ward ([1993] 1 Weekly Law Reports 619), the Court of Appeal stressed that the court and not the prosecution was to decide whether or not relevant evidence should be retained on grounds of public interest immunity. It explained that “... a judge is balancing on the one hand the desirability of preserving the public interest in the absence of disclosure against, on the other hand, the interests of justice. Where the interests of justice arise in a criminal case touching and concerning liberty or conceivably on occasion life, the weight to be attached to the interests of justice is plainly very great indeed”. 37.In R. v. Davis, Johnson and Rowe ([1993] 1 Weekly Law Reports613), the Court of Appeal held that it was not necessary in every case for the prosecution to give notice to the defence when it wished to claim public interest immunity, and outlined three different procedures to be adopted. The first procedure, which had generally to be followed, was for the prosecution to give notice to the defence that they were applying for a ruling by the court and indicate to the defence at least the category of the material which they held. The defence would then have the opportunity to make representations to the court. Secondly, however, where the disclosure of the category of the material in question would in effect reveal that which the prosecution contended should not be revealed, the prosecution should still notify the defence that an application to the court was to be made, but the category of the material need not be disclosed and the application should be ex parte. The third procedure would apply in an exceptional case where to reveal even the fact that an ex parte application was to be made would in effect be to reveal the nature of the evidence in question. In such cases the prosecution should apply to the court ex parte without notice to the defence. 38.The Court of Appeal observed that although ex parte applications limited the rights of the defence, in some cases the only alternative would be to require the prosecution to choose between following an inter partes procedure or declining to prosecute, and in rare but serious cases the abandonment of a prosecution in order to protect sensitive evidence would be contrary to the public interest. It referred to the important role performed by the trial judge in monitoring the views of the prosecution as to the proper balance to be struck and remarked that, even in cases in which the sensitivity of the information required an ex parte hearing, the defence had “as much protection as can be given without pre-empting the issue”. Finally, it emphasised that it was for the trial judge to continue to monitor the position as the trial progressed. Issues might emerge during the trial which affected the balance and required disclosure “in the interests of securing fairness to the defendant”. For this reason it was important for the same judge who heard any disclosure application also to conduct the trial. 39.The leading case on disclosure at the time of the applicants’ trials was the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R. v. Keane ([1994] 1 Weekly Law Reports 746). The Lord Chief Justice, giving the judgment of the court, held that the prosecution should put before the judge only those documents which it regarded as material but wished to withhold on grounds of public interest immunity. “Material” evidence was defined as evidence which could be seen, “on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution: (1) to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case; (2) to raise or possibly raise a new issue whose existence is not apparent from the evidence which the prosecution proposes to use; (3) to hold out a real (as opposed to fanciful) prospect of providing a lead on evidence which goes to (1) or (2)”. 40.Once the judge was seized of the material, he or she had to perform the balancing exercise between the public interest in non-disclosure and the importance of the documents to the issues of interest, or likely to be of interest, to the accused. If the disputed material might prove the defendant’s innocence or avoid a miscarriage of justice, the balance came down firmly in favour of disclosing it. Where, on the other hand, the material in question would not be of assistance to the accused, but would in fact assist the prosecution, the balance was likely to be in favour of non-disclosure. 41.In the case of R. v. Turner ([1995] 1 Weekly Law Reports 264), the Court of Appeal returned to the balancing exercise, stating, inter alia: “Since R. v. Ward ... there has been an increasing tendency for defendants to seek disclosure of informants’ names and roles, alleging that those details are essential to the defence. Defences that the accused has been set up, and allegations of duress, which used at one time to be rare, have multiplied. We wish to alert judges to the need to scrutinise applications for disclosure of details about informants with very great care. They will need to be astute to see that assertions of a need to know such details, because they are essential to the running of the defence, are justified. If they are not so justified, then the judge will need to adopt a robust approach in declining to order disclosure. Clearly, there is a distinction between cases in which the circumstances raise no reasonable possibility that information about the informant will bear upon the issues and cases where it will. Again, there will be cases where the informant is an informant and no more; other cases where he may have participated in the events constituting, surrounding, or following the crime. Even when the informant has participated, the judge will need to consider whether his role so impinges on an issue of interest to the defence, present or potential, as to make disclosure necessary ...” 42.The requirements of disclosure have since been set out in a statutory scheme. Under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (CIPA), which came into force in England and Wales immediately upon gaining Royal Assent on 4 July 1996, the prosecution must make “primary disclosure” of all previously undisclosed evidence which, in the prosecutor’s view, might undermine the case for the prosecution. The defendant must then give a defence statement to the prosecution and the court, setting out in general terms the nature of the defence and the matters on which the defence takes issue with the prosecution. The prosecution must then make a “secondary disclosure” of all previously undisclosed material “which might reasonably be expected to assist the accused’s defence as disclosed by the defence statement”. Disclosure by the prosecution may be subject to challenge by the accused and review by the trial court. 43.Following the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in Chahal v. the United Kingdom (15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V) and Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom (10 July 1998, Reports 1998IV), the United Kingdom introduced legislation making provision for the appointment of a “special counsel” in certain cases involving national security. The provisions are contained in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 (“the 1997 Act”) and the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”). Under this legislation, where it is necessary on national security grounds for the relevant tribunal to sit in camera, in the absence of the affected individual and his or her legal representatives, the Attorney-General may appoint a special counsel to represent the interests of the individual in the proceedings. The legislation provides that the special counsel is not however “responsible to the person whose interest he is appointed to represent”, thus ensuring that the special counsel is both entitled and obliged to keep confidential any information which cannot be disclosed. The relevant rules giving effect to the 1997 and 1998 Acts are set out in the Court’s judgment in Jasper v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no.27052/95, § 36, 16 February 2000). 44.In December 1999 the government commissioned a comprehensive review of the criminal justice system, under the chairmanship of a senior Court of Appeal judge, Sir Robin Auld. The report, published in September 2001 after extensive consultation and entitled “The Review of the Criminal Courts in and ” (“the Auld Report”), recommended, inter alia, the introduction of a “special counsel” scheme in cases where the prosecution wished to seek, ex parte, non-disclosure on grounds of public interest immunity. The recommendation was explained in the Auld Report as follows (footnotes omitted): “193.The scheme [developed by the common law since R. v. Ward and reflected in the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996: see above] is an improvement on what went before and has been generally welcomed on that account. But there is widespread concern in the legal professions about lack of representation of the defendant’s interest in the [ex parte] forms of application, and anecdotal and reported instances of resultant unfairness to the defence. ... A suggestion, argued on behalf of applicants in and widely supported in the Review, is that the exclusion of the defendant from the procedure should be counterbalanced by the introduction of a ‘special independent counsel’. He would represent the interest of the defendant at first instance and, where necessary, on appeal on a number of issues: first, as to the relevance of the undisclosed material if and to the extent that it has not already been resolved in favour of disclosure but for a public interest immunity claim; second, on the strength of the claim to public interest immunity; third, on how helpful the material might be to the defence; and fourth, generally to safeguard against the risk of judicial error or bias. 194.In my view, there is much to be said for such a proposal, regardless of the vulnerability or otherwise of the present procedures to Article 6. Tim Owen QC, in a paper prepared for the Review, has argued powerfully in favour of it. It would restore some adversarial testing of the issues presently absent in the determination of these often critical and finely balanced applications. It should not be generally necessary for special counsel to be present throughout the trial. Mostly the matter should be capable of resolution by the court before trial and, if any question about it arises during trial, he could be asked to return. If, because of the great number of public interest immunity issues now being taken in the courts, the instruction of special counsel for each would be costly, it simply indicates, as Owen has commented, the scale of the problem and is not an argument against securing a fair solution. 195.The role would be similar to that of an amicus curiae brought in to give independent assistance to a court, albeit mostly on appeal. In rape cases, where an unrepresented defendant seeks to cross-examine a complainant, the court must inform him that he may not do so, and should he refuse to instruct counsel, the court will appoint and instruct one. After the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in Chahal and Tinnelly, the government introduced such a procedure in immigration cases involving national security. Although such cases are extremely rare, it is sufficient that the principle of a ‘third’ or ‘special’ counsel being instructed on behalf of a defendant has been conceded in a number of areas. 196.The introduction of a system of special independent counsel could, as Owen has also noted, in part fill a lacuna in the law as to public interest immunity hearings in the absence of a defendant appellant in the Court of Appeal, to which the 1996 Act and supporting Rules do not apply. Where there has been a breach of Article 6 because a trial judge did not conduct a public interest immunity hearing due to the emergence of the material only after conviction, the European Court of Human Rights has held that the breach cannot be cured by a hearing before the Court of Appeal in the absence of the appellant. The Court’s reasons for so holding were that the appeals court is confined to examining the effect of non-disclosure on the trial ex post facto and could possibly be unconsciously influenced by the jury’s verdict into underestimating the significance of the undisclosed material. 197.However, even the introduction of special counsel to such hearings would not solve the root problem to which I have referred of police failure, whether out of incompetence or dishonesty, to indicate to the prosecutor the existence of critical information. Unless, as I have recommended, the police significantly improve their performance in that basic exercise, there will be no solid foundation for whatever following safeguards are introduced into the system. I recommend the introduction of a scheme for instruction by the court of special independent counsel to represent the interests of the defendant in those cases at first instance and on appeal where the court now considers prosecution applications in the absence of the defence in respect of the non-disclosure of sensitive material.” 45.In R. v. H.; R. v. C. [2004] United Kingdom House of Lords Decisions 3, decided on 5 February 2004 after the Chamber judgment in the present case, the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords held, inter alia: “The years since the decision in R. v. Davis [see paragraph 37 above] and the enactment of the CIPA [see paragraph 42 above] have witnessed the introduction in some areas of the law of a novel procedure designed to protect the interests of a party against whom an adverse order may be made and who cannot (either personally or through his legal representative), for security reasons, be fully informed of all the material relied on against him. The procedure is to appoint a person, usually called a ‘special advocate’, who may not disclose to the subject of the proceedings the secret material disclosed to him, and is not in the ordinary sense professionally responsible to that party but who, subject to those constraints, is charged to represent that party’s interests. ... There is as yet little express sanction in domestic legislation or domestic legal authority for the appointment of a special advocate or special counsel to represent, as an advocate in PII [public interest immunity from disclosure] matters, a defendant in an ordinary criminal trial ... But novelty is not of itself an objection, and cases will arise in which the appointment of an approved advocate as special counsel is necessary, in the interests of justice, to secure protection of a criminal defendant’s right to a fair trial. Such an appointment does however raise ethical problems, since a lawyer who cannot take full instructions from his client, nor report to his client, who is not responsible to his client and whose relationship with the client lacks the quality of confidence inherent in any ordinary lawyer-client relationship, is acting in a way hitherto unknown to the legal profession. While not insuperable, these problems should not be ignored, since neither the defendant nor the public will be fully aware of what is being done. The appointment is also likely to cause practical problems: of delay, while the special counsel familiarises himself with the detail of what is likely to be a complex case; of expense, since the introduction of an additional, high-quality advocate must add significantly to the cost of the case; and of continuing review, since it will not be easy for a special counsel to assist the court in its continuing duty to review disclosure, unless the special counsel is present throughout or is instructed from time to time when need arises. Defendants facing serious charges frequently have little inclination to cooperate in a process likely to culminate in their conviction, and any new procedure can offer opportunities capable of exploitation to obstruct and delay. None of these problems should deter the court from appointing special counsel where the interests of justice are shown to require it. But the need must be shown. Such an appointment will always be exceptional, never automatic; a course of last and never first resort. It should not be ordered unless and until the trial judge is satisfied that no other course will adequately meet the overriding requirement of fairness to the defendant. ...”",2004,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

169,001-58281,Grand Chamber,"8.The applicant is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1957 and lives in Istanbul.>At the material time, the applicant was the major shareholder in Deniz Basın Yayın Sanayi ve Ticaret Organizasyon, a Turkish limited liability company which owns a weekly review entitled Haberde Yorumda Gerçek (“The Truth of News and Comments”), published in Istanbul. 10.In issue No. 42 of the review, dated 9 January 1993, a news commentary entitled “In Botan the poor peasants are expropriating the landlords!” was published. The relevant parts of this news commentary read: “... ‘The waves of the earthquake centred on Botan have reached all of Kurdistan. The national liberation struggle, growing like the ripples caused by a stone cast into a pool of water, has already gone past Botan in waves, currently embracing 50 districts in 8 provinces in the active front of armed struggle.’ PKK [Kurdistan Workers’ Party ] sources briefly describe the extent of the national struggle in Kurdistan as follows: the said 8 provinces (together with their districts) are Hakkari, Şırnak, Siirt, Mardin, Batman, Urfa and Diyarbakır; while the provinces of Van, Malatya, Bitlis, Muş and Gaziantep and their districts are described as being partially involved in the war. The popular movements in the Botan area, where approximately 4.5 to 5million Kurds live, which have developed with the rise of the national liberation movement, have made rapid strides in the years 1990-92. The political point reached in the area is that the State has almost become inoperative. ... The domain vacated by the State in the political sense has since been occupied by the PKK in the rural areas and H.E.P. organisations in the cities. ... Land cannot be redistributed before it is transferred to the free will of the Kurdish people, because it is inconceivable to distribute land that bears the seal of the Republic of Turkey.... Today, our struggle is an external war directed against the forces of the Republic of Turkey.... We want to wage a total liberation struggle....” 11.On 10 January 1993 the Istanbul National Security Court (İstanbul Devlet Güvenlik Mahkemesi) ordered the seizure of this edition of the review on the ground that, allegedly, it disseminated propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. 12.In an indictment dated 28 January 1993, the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court charged the applicant, being the owner of the review, with disseminating propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. The charges were brought under section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (-“the 1991 Act”; see paragraph 16 below) on account of the publication of the above news commentary, which concerned, inter alia, the activities of the PKK. 13.In the proceedings before the National Security Court, the applicant denied the charges. He pleaded that the commentary on which the charges were based in fact criticised the activities of the PKK. He invoked Article10 of the Convention and referred to the case-law of the Commission and the Court. He stated that pluralism of opinions, including those opinions which shock or offend, is essential in a democratic society. He argued that the provisions of section 8 of the 1991 Act restrict the right to freedom of expression in contravention of the Turkish Constitution and the criteria laid down by the case-law of the Commission and the Court. 14.In a judgment dated 27 September 1993, the National Security Court found the applicant guilty of making propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. The applicant was first sentenced to a fine of 100,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL). Thereupon the Court, considering the good conduct of the applicant during the trial, reduced the fine to TRL 83,333,333. The National Security Court, considering those parts of the news commentary cited at paragraph 10 above in the light of the article as a whole, observed that it referred to certain parts of Turkey as “Kurdistan”. Moreover, in the words of the Court, it described the acts of the “PKK terrorist organisation” as a national liberation struggle, which amounted to propaganda aimed at undermining the indivisibility of the State. 15.The applicant appealed. He, inter alia, reiterated the defence he had relied on before the National Security Court. On 18 February 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal, upholding the cogency of the National Security Court’s assessment of evidence. 16.The relevant provisions of the Press Act 1950 read as follows: Section 3 “For the purposes of the present Law, the term ‘periodicals’ shall mean newspapers, press agency dispatches and any other printed matter published at regular intervals. ‘Publication’ shall mean the exposure, display, distribution, emission, sale or offer for sale of printed matter on premises to which the public have access where anyone may see it. An offence shall not be deemed to have been committed through the medium of the press unless publication has taken place, except where the material in itself is unlawful.” 17.The relevant provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 read as follows: Section 8 (before amendment by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited, irrespective of the methods used and the intention. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than two and not more than five years’ imprisonment and a fine of from fifty million to one hundred million Turkish liras. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the above paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched. However the fine may not be less than one hundred million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical concerned shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher and sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment.” Section 8 (as amended by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than one and not more than three years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras. The penalty imposed on a reoffender may not be commuted to a fine. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly. However, the fine may not be less than one hundred million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical concerned shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher and sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of printed matter or by means of mass communication other than periodicals within the meaning of the second paragraph, those responsible and the owners of the means of mass communication shall be sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras… …” Section 13 (before amendment by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “The penalties for the offences contemplated in the present law may not be commuted to a fine or any other measure, nor may they be accompanied by a reprieve.” Section 13 (as amended by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “The penalties for the offences contemplated in the present Law may not be commuted to a fine or any other measure, nor may they be accompanied by a reprieve. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply to convictions pursuant to section 8.” 18.The relevant provisions of domestic law governing the organisation and procedure of the National Security Court are quoted in paragraphs 3236 of the Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) judgment, which is being delivered on the same date as the present judgment.",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1.
56.  THE APPLICANT CLAIMED COMPENSATION FOR PECUNIARY AND NONPECUNIARY DAMAGE AS WELL AS REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE DOMESTIC AND CONVENTION PROCEEDINGS. ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION PROVIDES:
“IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION OR THE PROTOCOLS THERETO, AND IF THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTY CONCERNED ALLOWS ONLY PARTIAL REPARATION TO BE MADE, THE COURT SHALL, IF NECESSARY, AFFORD JUST SATISFACTION TO THE INJURED PARTY.”
A.	PECUNIARY DAMAGE
57.  THE APPLICANT CLAIMED THE SUM OF 100,000 FRENCH FRANCS (FRF) BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR THE FINE IMPOSED ON HIM AND PAID (SEE PARAGRAPH 14 ABOVE). THE AMOUNT CLAIMED INCLUDED INTEREST ACCRUED, TOOK ACCOUNT OF THE HIGH RATE OF INFLATION IN THE RESPONDENT STATE AND WAS CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF AN EXCHANGE RATE FROM 1993.
58.  THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THAT THE SUM CLAIMED BY THE APPLICANT WAS EXORBITANT HAVING REGARD TO THE FACT THAT THE APPLICANT WAS ONLY FINED 83,333,333 TURKISH LIRAS AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO PAY THE FINE IN MONTHLY INSTALMENTS. THE GOVERNMENT ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE APPLICANT HAD NOT PROVIDED ANY DETAILS TO SUBSTANTIATE THE AMOUNT CLAIMED FOR HIS ALLEGED OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES.
59.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT COMMENT.
60.  THE COURT WOULD OBSERVE THAT IT CANNOT SPECULATE AS TO WHAT THE OUTCOME OF PROCEEDINGS COMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE 6 § 1 WOULD HAVE BEEN, IRRESPECTIVE OF ITS OWN FINDING THAT THE RESPONDENT STATE IS NOT IN BREACH OF ARTICLE 10 ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPLICANT’S CONVICTION AND SENTENCE. IT CONSIDERS THAT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE APPLICANT’S CLAIM SHOULD BE DISALLOWED.
B.	NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE
61.  THE APPLICANT CLAIMED THAT AS A LAWYER HIS CAREER HAD BEEN BLIGHTED ON ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT HE HAS A CONVICTION RECORDED AGAINST HIM FOR AN OFFENCE OF TERRORISM. HE REQUESTED THE COURT TO AWARD HIM THE SUM OF FRF 80,000 BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR MORAL DAMAGE.
62.  THE GOVERNMENT ARGUED THAT IF THE COURT WERE MINDED TO FIND A VIOLATION IN THIS CASE THAT FINDING WOULD CONSTITUTE IN ITSELF SUFFICIENT JUST SATISFACTION UNDER THIS HEAD.
63.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT COMMENT ON THIS LIMB OF THE APPLICANT’S CLAIM EITHER.
64.  THE COURT RECALLS THAT IT HAS FOUND THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 ON THE FACTS OF THIS CASE. IT CONSIDERS THAT A FINDING OF A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 CONSTITUTES IN ITSELF SUFFICIENT JUST SATISFACTION FOR THE APPLICANT’S ALLEGED NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE.
C.	COSTS AND EXPENSES
65.  THE APPLICANT CLAIMED THE LEGAL COSTS AND EXPENSES (TRANSLATION, POSTAL, COMMUNICATIONS AND TRAVEL EXPENDITURE) WHICH HE INCURRED IN THE PROCEEDING BEFORE THE DOMESTIC COURTS AND THE CONVENTION INSTITUTIONS. HE ASSESSED THESE AT FRF 50,000. AS TO THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION AND COURT THE APPLICANT STATED THAT HIS LAWYER’S FEES WERE BASED ON THE TURKISH BAR ASSOCIATION’S MINIMUM RATE SCALES. THE APPLICANT ADDED THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT CLAIMED TOOK ACCOUNT OF THE HIGH LEVEL OF INFLATION IN TURKEY AND WAS BASED ON CURRENT EXCHANGES RATE.
66.  THE GOVERNMENT STATED THAT THE AMOUNT CLAIMED WAS EXAGGERATED IN COMPARISON WITH FEES EARNED BY TURKISH LAWYERS IN THE DOMESTIC COURTS AND HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY JUSTIFIED. THE CASE WAS SIMPLE AND HAD NOT REQUIRED MUCH EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE APPLICANT’S LAWYER WHO HAD DEALT WITH IT THROUGHOUT THE PROCEEDINGS IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE. THEY CAUTIONED AGAINST THE MAKING OF AN AWARD WHICH WOULD ONLY CONSTITUTE A SOURCE OF UNJUST ENRICHMENT HAVING REGARD TO THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THE RESPONDENT STATE.
67.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT COMMENT.
68.  THE COURT NOTES THAT IT HAS FOUND A BREACH ONLY IN RESPECT OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION. IT FURTHER NOTES THAT THE APPLICANT’S LAWYER HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION OF OTHER CASES BEFORE THE COURT CONCERNING COMPLAINTS UNDER ARTICLES 6 AND 10 OF THE CONVENTION WHICH ARE BASED ON SIMILAR FACTS. DECIDING ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS AND ACCORDING TO THE CRITERIA LAID DOWN IN ITS CASE-LAW (SEE, AMONG MANY OTHER AUTHORITIES, THE NIKOLOVA V.

73,001-58848,Grand Chamber,"7.On 15 March 1984, pursuant to Law no. 833/78, which created the National Health Service and required regional governments, inter alia, to adopt appropriate measures for the prevention, screening and treatment of disabilities, the Campania Regional Council enacted Regional Law no. 11 (“the Regional Law”). Article 26 of the Regional Law authorised local public health services (Unità Sanitarie Locali – “USLs”) to grant allowances for the first three years after its entry into force to families caring for disabled members of their household directly in their own homes.>On 5 December 1989 the Management Committee (Comitato di gestione) of Benevento USL no. 5, applying Article 26 of the Regional Law, decided that 134 persons, including the applicant's son, satisfied the conditions entitling their families to payment of the allowance. The decision authorised only distribution to qualifying beneficiaries, depending on the date when they had been recognised as 100% disabled, of the sum of 35,328,240 Italian lire (ITL) for the year 1985; the applicant received ITL84,720 in respect of the months of November and December 1985.>By a notice to pay served on 12 June 1993, the applicant asked Benevento USL no. 5 to grant him the allowance. He pointed out that the placing of his son's name on the list of persons who satisfied the conditions required by the Regional Law for entitlement to the allowance had not been followed by the payment provided for in Article 26 of the Regional Law. 10.As the USL did not reply, the applicant brought proceedings against it in the Campania Regional Administrative Court (“the RAC”) on 2 August 1993. Relying on Article 26 of the Regional Law, he sought a declaration that the lack of an answer from the USL – amounting to a refusal – had been unlawful and that he was entitled to the allowance in question for the years 1985, 1986 and 1987. 11.On 13 August 1993 the applicant requested that a date be fixed for the hearing. On 27 July 1995 he submitted an urgent request for a hearing date to be fixed, observing, inter alia, that the USLs were to be restructured on 31December 1995 and that Italian legislation made no provision for financial continuity between the old entities and the new ones. He was therefore asking for his case to be set down because after the end of 1995 he would no longer be able to obtain the allowance he sought. In a pleading filed on a date which has not been specified, USL no. 5 submitted, among other arguments, that it did not have capacity to defend the action (legittimazione passiva), on the ground that only the Region was required to make available the financial resources needed for payment of the allowance. It maintained that the applicant, who had received the allowance for the year 1985, within the limits of the budgetary appropriations, should have challenged the decision of 5 December 1989, but as he had not done so it had become final and the amount paid could no longer be called into question. 12.The case was heard on 14 January 1997. In a judgment of 14 January and 4 February 1997, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 3March 1997, the RAC observed in the first place that the applicant was not required to challenge the decision in issue as it did not contain a refusal to pay the full amount of the allowance. On the contrary, there had been two valid alternative ways of interpreting the USL's conduct. For example, the applicant could have thought the USL was making a payment on account, while reserving final determination of the amount to be paid for a later assessment, or that it had decided to pay a larger sum with an initial instalment to be followed by others. On the merits, the RAC held that, once it had been verified that the statutory conditions for entitlement to the allowance had been satisfied, it should be paid in the quantum provided for in Article 26. The administrative authority thus had no discretionary power and its role should have been restricted to making a purely arithmetical calculation. The applicant had duly established that he was the father of a 100% disabled civilian living with his family; moreover, his son's name was the 95th in the list included in the decision of 5 December 1989. The USL should therefore have ruled on his application. However, as the Court of Cassation had stated when determining a dispute over jurisdiction (judgment no. 8297 of 11 October 1994), the applicant could not claim to have a “personal right” (diritto soggettivo perfetto) but only a “legitimate interest” (interesse legittimo), that is to say an individual position indirectly protected as far as was consistent with the public interest, which would remain the case until such time as the administrative authority adopted a decision to award the allowance and specified the total amount to be paid. The RAC therefore dismissed the applicant's action in so far as it concerned recognition of his entitlement to the allowance in question. 13.On 20 June and 5 July 1997 respectively USL no. 5 and the Campania Regional Council appealed to the Consiglio di Stato. By a decision of 30 August 1997 the Consiglio di Stato stayed execution of the first-instance judgment. 14.On 14 November 1997 the Director-General of the ASL (Azienda Sanitaria Locale), the body which had taken the place of the USL, approved the text of a friendly settlement reached on 7 November between the administrative authority and the applicant, among others. Noting that in numerous similar cases the competent courts had nearly always recognised that the plaintiffs were entitled to the allowance for the years 1985-87, further noting that the settlement had been signed after it had been verified that the conditions required by the Regional Law had been satisfied, and having regard to the fact that the settlement was about to put an end to a high-profile case which would in all probability have gone against the administrative authority, given the line the courts had taken on the question, so that the public purse would be saved billions of lire, the Director-General ordered payment of the allowance. By a judgment of 25 November 1997, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 27 December 1997, the Consiglio di Stato took formal note of the friendly settlement the parties had reached and struck the case out of its list. 15.The allowance for the families of disabled civilians is governed by Article 26 of Regional Law no. 11 of 15 March 1984, the relevant parts of which provide: “For three years after the entry into force of the present Law, local public health services shall be authorised to grant an allowance to families who undertake to provide direct care for persons suffering from mental or physical disabilities who are incapable of attending to their own primary needs and require constant assistance. The allowance shall be granted in pursuance of the following objectives: (a)returning to their families disabled people formerly in full-time institutional care; (b)encouraging the practice of caring for disabled children within the family ...; (c)socialising the disabled person and improving his relations with those around him; (d)improving the lives of the families of disabled persons; (e)creating a favourable environment for the life of the disabled person; ... The amount of the family carers' allowance shall be 25% of the daily charge for attendance on persons hospitalised full-time.” 16.The Court of Cassation has given a number of rulings on the carers' allowance in connection with appeals on points of law concerning disputes over jurisdiction. 17.For example, in judgment no. 5386 of 12 May 1993 it held that, where the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts had been recognised in a decision which had become final, disputes concerning Article 26 of the Regional Law fell into the category of disputes over mandatory assistance, which came within the jurisdiction of the magistrate's court, sitting as an employment tribunal. In judgment no. 8297 of 11 October 1994 it held that the administrative courts had jurisdiction over disputes about entitlement to the allowance, ruling that the beneficiary could not claim to have a personal right but only a legitimate interest, that is to say an individual position indirectly protected as far as was consistent with the public interest, and that this would remain the case until such time as the administrative authority adopted a decision to award the allowance and specified the total amount to be paid. The appellants in these two cases were in a similar situation to MrMennitto, but had applied to the ordinary courts. 18.The Campania RAC has upheld on many occasions the claims of other persons caring for disabled relatives. In its judgment no. 251, deposited with the registry on 16 May 1995, it ruled: “[The Court] declares that the claimant is entitled to receive the allowance provided for in Article 26 of [the Regional Law] ...; Orders the respondent authority to pay the sum in question ...” In that decision and in others (such as judgment no. 310 of 4 July 1995 and judgments nos. 323 and 324 of 6 February and 11 June 1996) the RAC gave the following reasons for its ruling: “[Article 26 of the Regional Law] makes adoption of the decision to grant the allowance subject, among other requirements, to verification that beneficiaries satisfy the relevant qualifying conditions. When such verification had been made, determination of the amount to be paid should have required no more than a simple arithmetical calculation ... In the light of these principles ..., exercise of the discretionary power pleaded by the USL has no bearing on the case, since otherwise it would be possible for an administrative decision to replace an assessment already ineluctably made by the legislature ...” After finding that G.C. (the relative of the claimant in that case) was 100% disabled and required constant assistance, which was why, following tests carried out by the respondent authority, his name had been placed on the list of qualifying beneficiaries, the RAC ruled that there was an obligation to pay the allowance. 19.The Consiglio di Stato, ruling on the question of determination of the amount of the allowance, held that the Region could not be absolved from the obligation to make available to each USL a sum earmarked for families providing direct care to disabled persons and sufficiently large to ensure that each of these families would be able to receive the amount of allowance prescribed by law (judgment no. 766 of 3 October 1994). In its judgment no. 172 of 17 February 1999 the Consiglio di Stato ruled that the amount of the allowance for families caring directly for disabled persons, in so far as it was fixed by law, could not suffer any reduction by the administrative authority, which in this matter had no discretion whatever with regard to quantum, and that that conclusion was not in contradiction with the nature of the legitimate interest of the disabled person's family.",2000,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

99,001-72934,Grand Chamber,"13.The applicant was born in 1933 and lived in Paduli (). 15.On 21 November 1994 the Magistrate’s Court set the case down for the first hearing on 19 February 1996. On that day the court appointed an expert and adjourned the proceedings to a hearing on 8 July 1997. The hearing was adjourned by the court of its own motion to 28 January 1999. On that date the court set the case down for hearing of oral submissions on 15 June 1999. In the meantime, following his mother’s death, Mr Casciano declared his intention to continue the proceedings. 16.The following hearing was adjourned by the court of its own motion to 14February 2000. However, it was not held on that date because of a lawyers’ strike. The three hearings held between 28 March 2000 and 7November 2000 were devoted to new expert evidence. 17.In a decision of 30 January 2001, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 6 February 2001, the Benevento Magistrate’s Court, sitting as an employment tribunal, dismissed the applicant’s claim. 18.On 15 February 2001 Mr Casciano appealed to the Naples Court of Appeal. On 2 January 2002 the president appointed a reporting judge. The first hearing was held on 7 October 2002. Two hearings later, on 19May 2003, judgment was reserved. In a judgment of the same date, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 6 November 2003, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. 19.On an unspecified date, after 16 October 2001, the applicant’s son lodged an application with the Rome Court of Appeal under Law no.89 of 24March2001, known as the “Pinto Act”, complaining of the excessive length of the above-described proceedings. The applicant’s son requested the court to rule that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to order the Italian Government to pay compensation for the non-pecuniary damage sustained and pay the legal costs including those incurred before the Court. Mr Casciano claimed, inter alia, 20,000,000 Italian lire (10,329.14 euros (EUR)) in non-pecuniary damages. He sought the reimbursement of his legal costs, including those incurred before the Court, but did not quantify or give particulars of them. 20.In a decision of 5 April 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 6 June 2002, the Court of Appeal found that the proceedings had been excessively long. It held as follows: The Court of Appeal awarded Mr Casciano EUR1,200 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, EUR500 for costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the Court and EUR500 – of which EUR300 were under the head of fees – for the Pinto proceedings. The decision was served on the authorities on 13November 2002 and became final on 13 January 2003. The authorities were given notice to comply on 20 March 2003 and in April 2003 Mr Casciano lodged an application for a garnishee order with the judge responsible for enforcement proceedings. Payment was made on 5May 2004. 21.In a letter of 29 November 2002 Mr Casciano informed the Court of the outcome of the domestic proceedings and asked it to resume its examination of his application. 22.In the same letter the applicant’s son also informed the Court that he did not intend to appeal to the Court of Cassation because an appeal to that court could only be on points of law. 23.Award of just satisfaction in the event of a breach of the requirement to dispose of proceedings within a reasonable time and amendment to Article 375 of the Code of Civil Procedure CHAPTER II Just satisfaction Section 2 Entitlement to just satisfaction “1.Anyone sustaining pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage as a result of a violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, on account of a failure to comply with the ‘reasonable-time’ requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, shall be entitled to just satisfaction.>In determining whether there has been a violation, the court shall have regard to the complexity of the case and, in the light thereof, the conduct of the parties and of the judge deciding procedural issues, and also the conduct of any authority required to participate in or contribute to the resolution of the case.>The court shall assess the quantum of damage in accordance with Article 2056 of the Civil Code and shall apply the following rules: Section 3 Procedure “1.Claims for just satisfaction shall be lodged with the court of appeal in which the judge sits who has jurisdiction under Article 11 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to try cases concerning members of the judiciary in the district where the case in which the violation is alleged to have occurred was decided or discontinued at the merits stage or is still pending.>The claim shall be made on an application lodged with the registry of the court of appeal by a lawyer holding a special authority containing all the information prescribed by Article 125 of the Code of Civil Procedure.>The application shall be made against the Minister of Justice where the alleged violation has taken place in proceedings in the ordinary courts, the Minister of Defence where it has taken place in proceedings before the military courts and the Finance Minister where it has taken place in proceedings before the tax commissioners. In all other cases, the application shall be made against the Prime Minister.>The court of appeal shall hear the application in accordance with Articles 737 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure. The application and the order setting the case down for hearing shall be served by the applicant on the defendant authority at its elected domicile at the offices of State Counsel (Avvocatura dello Stato) at least fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing before the Chamber.>The parties may apply to the court for an order for production of all or part of the procedural and other documents from the proceedings in which the violation referred to in section 2 is alleged to have occurred and they and their lawyers shall be entitled to be heard by the court in private if they attend the hearing.

Treasury deposits shall be set aside for that purpose.>The Ministry of the Treasury, Economy and Financial Planning is authorised to make the appropriate budgetary adjustments by decree.” 24.On appeal from decisions delivered by the courts of appeal in “Pinto” proceedings, the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court (Sezioni Unite), gave four judgments (nos. 1338, 1339, 1340 and 1341) on 27November 2003, the texts of which were deposited with the registry on 26January 2004, quashing the appeal court’s decision and remitting the case for a rehearing. It held that “the case-law of the is binding on the Italian courts regarding the application of Law no. 89/2001”. In its judgment no. 1340 it affirmed, inter alia, the principle that 25.Extracts from the plenary Court of Cassation’s judgment no.1339 deposited with the registry on 26 January 2004 “... 2.- The present application poses the fundamental question of what legal effect must be given – in implementing the Law of 24 March 2001 no. 89, and in particular in determining the non-pecuniary damage arising out of the breach of the reasonable length of proceedings requirement – to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, whether considered generally as interpretative guidelines which the said Court has laid down with regard to the consequences of the said violation, or with reference to a specific case in which the European Court has already had occasion to give a judgment on the delay in reaching a decision. ... As stipulated in section 2.1 of the said Law, the legal fact which gives rise to the right to the just satisfaction that it provides for is constituted by the “violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified in accordance with the Law of 4 August 1955 no. 848, for failure to comply with the reasonable time referred to in Article 6, paragraph1 of the Convention.” In other words, Law no. 89/2001 identifies the fact constituting the right to compensation by reference to a specific provision of the European Convention on Human Rights. This Convention instituted a Court (the European Court of Human Rights, with its seat in ) to ensure compliance with the provisions contained therein (Article 19). Accordingly, the competence of the said court to determine, and therefore to interpret, the significance of the said provisions must be recognised. As the fact constituting the right conferred by Law no. 89/2001 consists of a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, it is for the Court of the European Convention on Human Rights to determine all the elements of such a legal fact, which thus ends by being “brought into conformity” by the Strasbourg Court, whose case-law is binding on the Italian courts in so far as the application of Law no. 89/2001 is concerned. It is not necessary therefore to pose the general problem of the relationships between the European Convention on Human Rights and the internal judicial system, which the Advocate-General (Procuratore Generale) has amply discussed in court. Whatever opinion one may have about that controversial issue and therefore about the place of the European Convention on Human Rights in the context of the sources of domestic law, it is certain that the direct implementation in the Italian judicial system of a provision of the European Convention on Human Rights, established by Law no. 89/2001 (that is, by Article 6 § 1 in the part relating to “reasonable time”), cannot diverge from the interpretation which the European Court gives of the same provision. The opposite argument, which would permit a substantial divergence between the application accorded to Law no. 89/2001 in the national system and the interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court to the right to reasonable length of proceedings, would deprive the said Law no. 89/2001 of any justification and cause the Italian State to violate Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, according to which ‘The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention’ (including the said Article 6, which provides for the right to have a case decided within a reasonable length of time). The reason behind the enactment of Law no. 89/2001 was the need to provide a domestic judicial remedy against violations in respect of the duration of proceedings, so as to give effect to the subsidiary character of intervention on the part of the Court of Strasbourg, expressly provided for by the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 35: “the Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted”). The European system for the protection of human rights is founded on the said principle of subsidiarity. From it derives the duty of the States which have ratified the European Convention on Human Rights to guarantee to individuals the protection of the rights recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights, above all in their own internal order and vis-à-vis the organs of the national judicial system. And this protection must be “effective” (Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights), that is, of a kind to remedy the claim without the need for recourse to the . The domestic remedy introduced by Law no. 89/2001 did not previously exist in the Italian system, with the consequence that appeals against in respect of a violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights had “clogged” (the term used by rapporteur Follieri in the sitting of the Senate of 28 September 2000) the . The observed, prior to Law no. 89/2001, that the said failures to comply on the part of “reflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy. This accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention” (see the four judgments of the Court delivered on 28 July in the cases of Bottazzi, Di Mauro, Ferrari and A. P.). Law no. 89/2001 constitutes the domestic remedy to which a “victim of a violation” (as defined by Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights) of Article 6 (failure to comply with the reasonable-time requirement) must have recourse before applying to the European Court to claim the “just satisfaction” provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which, when the violation exists, is only awarded by the Court “if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made”. Law no. 89/2001 has therefore allowed the European Court to declare inadmissible applications lodged with it (including before the Act was passed) and aimed at obtaining just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights for the excessive length of proceedings (Brusco v. Italy, decision of 6 September 2001). This mechanism for implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights and observance of the principle of subsidiarity in respect of interventions of the European Court of Strasbourg does not operate, however, in cases in which the Court holds that the consequences of the established violation of the European Convention on Human Rights have not been redressed by domestic law or that this has been done only “partially”, because in such an event the said Article 41 provides for the intervention of the European Court to protect the “victim of the violation”. In such cases an individual application to the on the basis of Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights is admissible (Scordino and Others v. Italy, decision of 27 March 2003) and the Court acts directly to protect the rights of the victim whom it considers not to have been adequately protected by domestic law. The judge of the adequacy or inadequacy of the protection that the victim has had from domestic law is, obviously, the European Court, whose duty it is to apply Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights to ascertain whether, in the presence of a violation of a provision of the European Convention on Human Rights, the internal law has been able to fully redress the consequences of this violation. The argument whereby, in applying Law no. 89/2001, the Italian court may follow a different interpretation from that which the European Court has given to the provisions of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (violation of which is the fact giving entitlement to the right to compensation attributed by the said national law) implies that the victim of the violation, if he or she receives reparation at national level considered inadequate by the European Court, must obtain the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights from the latter Court. This would defeat the purpose of the remedy provided for in Italian law by Law no. 89/2001 and entail a violation of the principle of the subsidiarity of the intervention of the . It is therefore necessary to concur with the European Court of Human Rights, which, in the above-mentioned decision on the Scordino application (concerning the inadequacy of the protection afforded by the Italian courts in implementing Law no. 89/2001), affirmed that “it follows from the principle of subsidiarity ... that the national courts must, where possible, interpret and apply domestic law in accordance with the Convention”. ... The preparatory documents of Law no. 89/2001 are even more explicit. In the report concerning the bill of Senator Pinto (proceedings of the Senate no. 3813 of 16February 1999) it is affirmed that the compensatory mechanism proposed in the legislative initiative (and then adopted by the Act) secures for the applicant “a protection analogous to that which he or she would receive in the international court”, as the direct reference to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights makes it possible to transfer to domestic level “the limits of applicability of the same provision existing at international level, limits which depend essentially on the State and on the development of the case-law of the Strasbourg authorities, especially that of the European Court of Human Rights, whose decisions must therefore guide ... the domestic court in the definition of these limits”. ... 6.– The considerations expounded in sections 3-5 of the document refer in general to the importance of the interpretative guidance of the on the implementation of Law no. 89/2001 with regard to reparation for non-pecuniary damage. In this particular instance, however, any possibility for the national court to exclude non-pecuniary damage (despite having found a violation of Article6 of the European Convention on Human Rights) must be considered as non-existent because such is precluded by the previous decision of the European Court which, with reference to the same proceedings, had already ascertained that the unjustified delay in reaching a decision had had consequences involving non-pecuniary damage for the applicant, which the Court itself redressed for a limited period. From such a decision of the it follows that, once the national court has ascertained that the violation has continued in the period following that considered in the said decision, the applicant has continued to suffer non-pecuniary damage, which must be compensated for in application of Law no. 89/2001. It cannot therefore be maintained – as the Rome Court of Appeal has done – that compensation is not due because of the small amounts at stake in the proceedings in question. Such a reason, apart from being rendered immaterial by the fact that the European Court has already ruled that non-pecuniary damage had been sustained because of delay in the same action, is in any case incorrect, because the amount of what is at stake in an action in which non-compliance with reasonable time-limits has been ascertained can never have the effect of excluding non-pecuniary damage, given that the anxiety and distress resulting from the length of the proceedings normally also occur in cases in which the amounts at stake are small; hence this aspect may have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation but not of totally excluding it. 7– In conclusion the decision appealed against must be quashed and the case remitted to the Rome Court of Appeal, which, in a different composition, will order payment to the applicant of the non-pecuniary damages payable as a result of the violation of the reasonable-time requirement for the period following 16 April 1996 alone, taking as a reference point payments of the same kind of damages by the European Court of Human Rights, from which it may diverge, but only to a reasonable extent (HR Court, 27 March 2003, Scordino v. Italy)”.>Case-law on the transfer of the right to compensation 26.The Court of Cassation held as follows: 27.The Court of Cassation judges noted that the right to compensation for a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time derived from the Pinto Act. The mechanism set in place by the European standard did not give applicants a cause of action before the domestic courts. Accordingly, the right to “just satisfaction” could neither be acquired nor transferred by a person who had already died by the time the Pinto Act came into force. The fact that the deceased had, while alive, lodged an application with the was not decisive. Section 6 of the Pinto Act did not constitute, as the applicants had maintained, a procedural standard bringing about a transfer of powers from the to the domestic courts. 28.In this case, which concerned the possibility or otherwise of transferring to heirs the right to compensation deriving from a breach of Article 6 § 1 on account of the length of the proceedings, the First Division of the Court of Cassation referred the case to the full court indicating that there was a conflict between the case-law authorities, that is, between the restrictive approach taken by the Court of Cassation in the earlier judgments regarding heirs and the Pinto Act and the four judgments delivered by the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, on 26 January 2004 to the extent that a less strict interpretation would lead to the conclusion that this right to compensation has existed since Italy ratified the European Convention on 4August 1955. 29.In the case giving rise to the order mentioned above referring the case to the full court (see preceding paragraph), the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, established the following principles, thus preventing any further conflicting decisions being given by the courts: (i) Law no.848 of 4 August 1955, which ratified the Convention and made it enforceable, introduced into domestic legal order the fundamental rights, belonging to the category of rights conferred on the individual by public law, provided for in the first section of the Convention and which correspond to a large extent with those set forth in Article 2 of the Constitution. In that respect the Convention provisions are confirmatory and illustrative. ... (ii) It is necessary to reiterate the principle that the act giving rise to the right to reparation conferred by domestic law corresponds to a breach of the provision in Article 6 of the Convention, which is immediately applicable in domestic law. The distinction between the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, introduced by the European Convention on Human Rights (or even pre-existing as a constitutionally protected value), and the right to equitable reparation, which was allegedly introduced only by the Pinto Act, cannot be allowed in so far as the protection provided by the domestic courts does not depart from that previously offered by the Strasbourg Court, the domestic courts being bound to comply with the case-law of the European Court. ... (iii) Accordingly, the right to equitable reparation for loss sustained as a result of the unreasonable length of proceedings prior to the entry into force of Law no. 89/2001 must be acknowledged by the domestic courts even in favour of the heirs of a party who introduced the proceedings before that date, subject only to the condition that the claim has not already been lodged with the Strasbourg Court and the Court has not ruled on admissibility. ... 30.This judgment of the Court of Cassation concerned an appeal by the Ministry of Justice challenging the Court of Appeal’s award of non-pecuniary damages to a juristic person. The Court of Cassation referred to the decision reached in the case of Comingersoll v. Portugal [GC], no.35382/97, ECHR 2000IV and, after referring to the four judgments of the full court delivered on 26 January 2004, found that its own case-law was not in line with the European Court. It held that there was no legal barrier to awarding just satisfaction to “juristic” persons according to the criteria of the . Accordingly, since the Court of Appeal had correctly decided the case the appeal was dismissed. 31.The Court of Cassation made the following observations: 32.In the report CM/Inf/DH(2004)23, revised on 24 September 2004, the Ministers’ deputies made the following indications regarding an assessment of the Pinto remedy: 33.In this interim resolution the Ministers’ deputies indicated as follows: “The Committee of Ministers Noting ... 34.The European Commission for the efficiency of justice was set up at the Council of Europe by Resolution Res(2002)12 with the aim of (a)improving the efficiency and the functioning of the justice of member States with a view to ensuring that everyone within their jurisdiction can enforce their legal rights effectively, thereby generating increased confidence of the citizens in the justice system and (b) enabling a better implementation of the international legal instruments of the Council of Europe concerning efficiency and fairness of justice. 35.In its framework programme (CEPEJ (2004) 19 Rev 2 § (7) the CEPEJ noted that “the mechanisms which are limited to compensation are too weak and do not adequately incite the States to modify their operational process, and provide compensation only a posteriori in the event of a proven violation instead of trying to find a solution for the problem of delays.”",2006,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

18,001-58226,Grand Chamber,"7.Mr Pélissier was born in 1944 and lives at Sanary-sur-Mer; Mr Sassi was born in 1935 and lives at . Both are French nationals.>On 16 October 1975 Mr Fernand Cortez and Mr Claude Cortez formed a private limited company (société à responsabilité limitée – Sàrl), Bleu Marine, whose object was the sale of pleasure craft. Fernand Cortez was appointed manager. In 1976 Bleu Marine started to trade with a public company, Chantiers Beneteau S.A., whose object was boat-building. On 8October 1981, Bleu Marine became Chantiers Beneteau’s exclusive distributor for the Var département coast.>On 31 March 1980 both applicants became shareholders in Bleu Marine, each holding 250 of a total of 1,000 shares (the remaining 500 belonged to the promoters, Fernand and Claude Cortez). 10.On 29 September 1982 Fernand Cortez, the applicants and MrDominique Stizi formed a private limited company, Station Service du Bateau Sàrl, which was run by Fernand Cortez and Dominique Stizi. Its objects were the development of port infrastructures, harbour building and the sale and outfitting of boats. The share capital was held by FernandCortez (48 shares), the applicants (24 shares), and Dominique Stizi (104shares). On 29 February 1984 the declared the company insolvent and ordered its judicial reorganisation. 11.By agreements made with Station Service du Bateau and another company, Cortez et Cie, Bleu Marine was granted a licence allowing it to launch its boats on the sea front. 12.In 1983 relations between Bleu Marine and Chantiers Beneteau started to deteriorate, the former owing the latter nearly three million French francs (FRF). Chantiers Beneteau then terminated the distribution agreement with Bleu Marine. 13.On 30 May 1983 Bleu Marine filed for insolvency. On 1 June 1983 the held that the company was insolvent and ordered its judicial reorganisation. 14.On 4 July 1984 the , finding that Bleu Marine had debts of almost FRF 10 million, ordered its liquidation under the supervision of the court. 15.On 20 June 1983 Chantiers Beneteau lodged a complaint with the senior investigating judge against a person or persons unknown for forgery of commercial documents and fraud by the falsification of a balance sheet and its use with a view to obtaining a rescheduling of debt which would never be honoured. On 16 December 1983 the investigating judge sent instructions to the Marseilles Regional Police Department. 16.On 27 June 1984 Fernand Cortez, the manager of Bleu Marine, was charged by the investigating judge assigned to the case. On 8October an additional charge of negligent and fraudulent bankruptcy was brought against him. On 22 January 1985 the investigating judge’s instructions of 16 December 1983 were carried out. The results revealed in particular the existence of a property holding company (société civile immobilière), SCI Le Ponant, which had been set up by Fernand Cortez, MrPélissier and Mr Sassi’s wife, in order to acquire land for letting to Bleu Marine. 17.On 15 October 1984 Mr and Mrs Grouzet lodged a complaint against Fernand Cortez and any other person having managerial responsibility for Bleu Marine, alleging misappropriation and, subsequently, fraud, in connection with the purchase and payment for a boat that was never delivered. On 4 October 1985 a Mr Louis Dreyer lodged a complaint against Fernand Cortez for misappropriation and applied to be joined to the proceedings as a civil party claiming damages. 18.On 14 September 1984, after appearing before the investigating judge on 20 and 21 August and 13 September 1984, the first applicant was charged with the offences set out in the complaint of 20 June 1983 and with negligent and fraudulent bankruptcy and misappropriation. 19.On 12 June 1985 the second applicant was charged with the same offences. 20.After Law no. 85-98 of 25 January 1985, which reformed insolvency law, came into force, the public prosecutor, considering there to be “strong evidence of criminal bankruptcy”, lodged an additional application to have Fernand Cortez, Dominique Stizi and the applicants charged with that offence under the new law. In so doing, he relied on the provisions relating to criminal bankruptcy and aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy. 21.In a letter of 14 November 1985 to the investigating judge, the lawyer acting for Chantiers Beneteau argued that a charge of aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy might lie against the applicants. On 17 July 1986 Chantiers Beneteau applied to be joined to the criminal bankruptcy proceedings as a civil party claiming damages. 22.On 1 December 1986 the investigating judge preferred an additional charge of “criminal bankruptcy” against Fernand Cortez under sections 196 and 197 of the Law of 25 January 1985 and Articles 402 and 403 of the Criminal Code. On 4, 16 and 19 December 1986 he preferred identical additional charges of “criminal bankruptcy” against the first applicant, the second applicant and Dominique Stizi respectively. 23.On 15 June 1987 the investigating judge appointed two accounting experts to audit the accounts. 24.On 30 June 1988 they submitted their report to the investigating judge. 25.On 10 January 1989 the investigating judge made an order transmitting the file to the public prosecutor for submissions (ordonnance de soit-communiqué). 26.On 27 June 1990 the investigating judge made a discharge order on the charges of forgery and using forged commercial documents, negligent and fraudulent bankruptcy and fraud; ultimately, the only charge on which the applicants were committed to stand trial at the Criminal Court was that of criminal bankruptcy under the Law of 25 January 1985. A discharge order was also made in the case of Fernand Cortez on the same charges and on the complaint lodged by Mr and Mrs Grouzet. He was committed to stand trial at the Criminal Court alone (on certain charges for which he was the sole defendant), with Dominique Stizi (on charges relating to the management of Station Service du Bateau), and with the applicants. In his order, the investigating judge cited Articles 402, 406 and 408 of the Criminal Code and sections 196 and 197 of the Law of 25 January 1985. 27.On 12 March 1991 the Toulon Criminal Court sentenced Fernand Cortez to one year’s imprisonment and a fine of FRF 20,000 for fraudulent bankruptcy, concealment of assets and misappropriation. It acquitted Dominique Stizi of the charges against him. Of the civil parties, Chantiers Beneteau’s application to be joined to the criminal bankruptcy proceedings was declared inadmissible and the court noted that Mr and Mrs Grouzet had withdrawn their application to be joined as civil parties; the only person to be awarded compensation was Louis Dreyer (in respect of the misappropriation by Fernand Cortez). 28.In the same judgment, the Toulon Criminal Court held with regard to the bankruptcy charges against the applicants: “It should firstly be noted that under the Law only de jure or de facto managers, not, as suggested by the prosecution, members, can commit the offence. Without it being necessary to consider whether the indictment is bad for failure to allege that the members [the applicants] were de facto managers, that being an essential element of the offence, it need only be observed that [the applicants] have not performed any acts of management, the de jure manager cannot be regarded as having been a ‘replaceable’, compliant manager and it does not appear that he gave the other two the right to sign on his behalf. ... Thus, as they cannot properly be described as de jure managers, the defendants Sassi and Pélissier must be acquitted of these offences.” 29.On 14 March 1991 Chantiers Beneteau appealed against that judgment. The public prosecutor and Fernand Cortez did likewise on 22March 1991. On 2 April 1992 Chantiers Beneteau lodged additional submissions with the registry of the Court of Appeal in which they proposed, in the alternative, recharacterising the acts the applicants were alleged to have committed as “aiding and abetting” criminal bankruptcy. 30.On 26 November 1992, after hearings on 16 April and 25 June 1992, the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal held that although the applicants could not be regarded as having been de facto managers of the company, they had nonetheless been informed of the serious difficulties it was in and had “wilfully performed positive, material acts that had facilitated, aided or abetted Cortez in the concealment of assets to the detriment of Bleu Marine”. It appears from the judgment that the applicants were regarded as appearing before the Court of Appeal as “defendants on criminal bankruptcy charges”. 31.The Court of Appeal consequently held that the applicants were guilty, not of the offences charged, but of the separate offence of aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy through the concealment of assets. As regards the first applicant in particular, the Court of Appeal found, inter alia, that he had furnished a false certificate in order to justify the payment of a sum of money in a suspect operation. It referred in its judgment to Chantiers Beneteau’s main submissions requesting the applicants’ conviction for criminal bankruptcy, but made no mention of the additional submissions lodged on 2 April 1992 concerning the accusation that they had aided and abetted criminal bankruptcy. There is a dispute as to whether that request was brought to the attention of the applicants; however, it is common ground that it was mentioned, as an ancillary point, by the civil party at the hearing. 32.The Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal sentenced each of the applicants to a suspended term of eighteen months’ imprisonment and to a fine of FRF 30,000. While upholding the conviction of Fernand Cortez and the partial discharge order made in his favour by the Toulon Criminal Court, it nonetheless increased the term of imprisonment to eighteen months, while suspending it, and the fine to FRF 30,000. Lastly, the Court of Appeal upheld Dominique Stizi’s acquittal, the award of damages to Louis Dreyer and the declaration that Chantiers Beneteau’s application to be joined as a civil party was inadmissible. 33.On 26 and 27 November 1992 the applicants appealed against that decision to the Court of Cassation on points of law. In their pleadings they denied the offence and contended on the basis of Article 6 of the Convention that the Court of Appeal’s decision to convict them of an offence different from that charged had not been the subject of adversarial argument and had infringed the rights of the defence. In addition, the first applicant submitted that when referring to alleged irregularities on his account the Court of Appeal had relied on allegations that had never been put to him and were incapable of showing that he had aided and abetted criminal bankruptcy. 34.In a judgment of 14 February 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants’ appeal on the grounds that: “... the reasons given in the impugned judgment enable the Court of Cassation to satisfy itself that the court below sufficiently made out, within the limits of its jurisdiction, all the constitutive elements of the actus reus and mens rea of both the principal offence of criminal bankruptcy committed by Fernand Cortez through the concealment of assets and the offence committed by Philippe Sassi and FrançoisPélissier of aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy through the concealment of assets. The grounds of appeal, which merely contest the findings which the court below, in its unfettered discretion, came to on the facts and circumstances of the case after hearing the parties’ submissions, cannot be upheld.” 35.The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide: Article 388 “The Criminal Court shall be seised of offences within its jurisdiction on the voluntary appearance of the parties, a summons accompanied by a statement of the charges, an immediate summary trial or, lastly, a committal by the investigating judge or judges.” Article 509 “The case is transferred to the Court of Appeal to the extent determined in the notice of appeal ...” 36.The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code in force at the material time were as follows: Article 59 “Accessories to a serious crime (crime) or other major offence (délit) shall be liable to the same penalties as the principals, except where statute provides otherwise.” Article 60 “A person who, by gifts, promises, threats, abuse of authority or power, scheming or contrivance, has incited the commission of a serious crime (crime) or other major offence (délit) or given instructions for its commission; has procured weapons, implements or any other means of assisting in the commission of an offence knowing that such weapons, implements or other means were intended for that purpose; or has knowingly aided or abetted the principal or principals in acts preparatory to the commission of the offence or facilitating its commission or in carrying out the offence, shall be guilty of an offence as accessories, without prejudice to the penalties specially imposed by this Code on persons conspiring to commit or inciting breaches of State security, even if the crime intended by those conspiring or inciting is not committed.” Article 402 “Persons found guilty of criminal bankruptcy shall be liable on conviction to between three months’ and five years’ imprisonment and a fine of between FRF10,000 and FRF 200,000 or to either of those penalties. In addition, an order may be made barring them from exercising the rights referred to in Article 42.” Article 403 “Accessories to criminal bankruptcy shall be liable to the same penalties as those laid down in the preceding Article, even if they are not merchants, craftsmen or farmers and do not directly or indirectly, de facto or de jure, manage a private-law legal entity having an economic activity.” 37.The relevant provisions of this law read as follows: Section 196 “The provisions of this Chapter are applicable to: (1)all traders and craftsmen; (2)anyone who has directly or indirectly, whether de jure or de facto, managed or liquidated a private-law entity having an economic activity; and (3)individuals who are permanent representatives of entities managing entities as defined in subsection 2 above.” Section 197 “Where judicial reorganisation proceedings are commenced, the persons referred to in section 196 shall be guilty of criminal bankruptcy if they are found to have done any of the following: (1)with the intention of avoiding or delaying the commencement of judicial reorganisation proceedings, made purchases with a view to resale at less than market value or used ruinous means to procure funding; (2)misappropriated or concealed all or part of the debtor’s assets; (3)fraudulently increased the debtor’s liabilities; or (4)held fictitious accounts or caused accounting documents of the undertaking or entity to disappear or failed to keep any accounts.”",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

47,001-60329,Grand Chamber,"9.Immediately following its birth in a private clinic, “La Madonnina”, in Cosenza the applicant's new-born baby was admitted to the intensive care unit of Cosenza Hospital suffering from serious respiratory and neurological post-asphyxia syndrome induced by the position in which it had become lodged during delivery. The baby died on 9 February 1987, two days after birth. 10.On 10 February 1987 the applicants lodged a complaint. The Cosenza public prosecutor's office started an investigation that same day. 11.On 12 February 1987 Ms Ciglio was questioned as a witness. A team of three expert witnesses was named. 12.As nothing further happened in the proceedings, the applicants made several requests, notably on 16 October 1987, and 12 April and 30 June 1988, for the investigation to be expedited. On 16 November 1988 the public prosecutor's office itself requested the expert witnesses to lodge their report. 13.On 19 June 1989 the applicants were informed that at the request of the public prosecutor's office, the investigating judge had notified E.C. – the doctor responsible for delivering the baby and the joint owner of the clinic – that charges would be brought against him. 14.Subsequently, the scheduled questioning of certain witnesses on 18July 1989 did not take place, as the judge dealing with the case was on holiday. 15.Meanwhile, on 7 July 1989, the applicants were joined to the proceedings as civil parties. 16.On 19 January 1990 the prosecution applied for the complaint to be filed away without further action. That application was dismissed on 24May 1990. 17.On 3 October 1990 the investigating judge instructed the public prosecutor's office to make further inquiries. Consequently, on 29November 1990 the deputy public prosecutor ordered forensic tests. The results were made available on 5 January 1991. 18.On 12 June 1991 E.C. was committed for trial before the Cosenza Criminal Court on a charge of involuntary manslaughter and the applicants renewed their application to be joined to the proceedings as civil parties. 19.The first hearing was set down for 2 July 1992 but had to be adjourned because of a lawyers' strike. The next hearing on 15 October 1992 was also adjourned due to a delay in service of a summons on the accused to appear. 20.A new hearing date was fixed for 15 January 1993. On that date an order was made for the accused's trial in absentia. The trial did not begin, however, until 19 March 1993, as meanwhile the accused had changed lawyers. The hearing scheduled for 29 April 1993 was adjourned until 3June 1993 as the composition of the bench was not the same as that to which the case had been allocated. The trial thereafter continued with hearings on 27 May, and 10 and 17 June (the latter hearing being adjourned as one of the expert witnesses appointed by the court had to be replaced). A hearing on 15 July 1993 was adjourned to 16 September 1993, again owing to the fact that the composition of the bench was not the same as that to which the case had been allocated. There were further hearings on 14 and 26October 1993. On the latter date the order for the accused's trial in absentia was revoked, but the hearing had to be adjourned as the expert witnesses failed to attend without due cause (they were ordered to pay a fine and to attend the next hearing on 14 December). A final hearing took place on 17 December 1993. The accused, who had attended the hearings on 26October and 14December 1993, was not present at that hearing. 21.At the hearing on 17 December the Cosenza Criminal Court found the accused guilty in absentia of involuntary manslaughter. Its judgment was lodged with the registry on 19 February 1994. The Criminal Court sentenced the accused to one year's imprisonment and ordered him to pay the civil parties' costs together with compensation to be assessed at a later date. 22.It found firstly that the accused knew that the birth had to be regarded as high risk since the mother was a level-A diabetic and had a past history of confinements that had been equally difficult because of the size of the foetus. The risks inherent in deliveries in such circumstances, which the expert witnesses appointed by the Criminal Court described as readily foreseeable, meant that precautionary measures should have been taken and that the doctor in charge should have been present. The Criminal Court found, however, that E.C., whom the applicant had consulted during the pregnancy, had made no arrangements for precautionary measures, such as an external examination of the mother, to assess whether the foetus was too large for a natural birth. Above all, he had absented himself during the birth. When the complications had occurred, it had taken the nursing staff six or seven minutes to locate E.C., who was busy seeing patients in another part of the clinic. The intervening delay before E.C. was able to perform the manipulation necessary to extract the foetus had significantly reduced the new-born's chances of survival. 23.The Criminal Court nevertheless suspended the sentence and ordered that the conviction should not appear on E.C.'s criminal record. In addition, it dismissed the civil parties' application for a provisional award of compensation. 24.On 17 March 1994 E.C. appealed to the Catanzaro Court of Appeal. 25.In a judgment of 3 August 1994, which was delivered in absentia and lodged with the registry on 17 August 1994, the Court of Appeal declared the appeal inadmissible. Noting that he had been tried in absentia at first instance, the Court of Appeal held that E.C. had failed to give his lawyer the authority to act required under the rules applicable in such cases. It ordered him to reimburse the costs incurred by the civil parties in the proceedings. 26.On 7 October 1994 E.C. appealed to the Court of Cassation. In a judgment of 22 December 1994, which was lodged with the registry on 23January 1995, the Court of Cassation overturned the decision of the Catanzaro Court of Appeal, to which it remitted the case for a retrial. It held that the Court of Appeal had erred in treating E.C. as being absent, as he had been present at the start of the trial and had accordingly to be regarded as having left the court during the trial and not as liable to trial in absentia. 27.In a judgment of 3 July 1995, which was lodged with the registry on 10 July 1995, the Catanzaro Court of Appeal ruled that the prosecution of the offence was time-barred. 28.In so doing, it noted that the limitation period for the offence of which E.C. was accused had expired on 9 August 1994, in other words, even before the Court of Cassation had delivered its judgment. 29.Following E.C.'s conviction at first instance by the Cosenza Criminal Court on 19 February 1994 (see paragraphs 21-22 above), the applicants served a summons requiring E.C. to appear before the civil court of that town. 30.However, on 27 April 1995 the applicants entered into an agreement with the insurers of the doctor and the clinic under which the insurers were to pay 95,000,000 Italian lire (ITL) for any damage sustained by the applicants. Of that sum, ITL 15,000,000 were designated as reparation for the special loss sustained by Ms Ciglio. At that time, the criminal proceedings were pending in the Catanzaro Court of Appeal following the Court of Cassation's judgment of 22 December 1994 (see paragraph 26 above). 31.Subsequently, as the parties failed to attend a hearing on 16November 1995, the case was struck out of the civil court's list. At that stage, the criminal proceedings had only just ended, the Court of Appeal's ruling that the prosecution of the offence was time-barred having become final on 17 October 1995. 32.Article 112 of the Italian Constitution provides: “The public prosecutor's office has a duty to prosecute.” 33.Article 589 of the Criminal Code lays down that the penalty for involuntary manslaughter is imprisonment of between six months and five years. 34.Furthermore, Article 157 § 1, sub-paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code provides that the limitation period for involuntary manslaughter is five years. That period may be extended by one half as a result of any interlocutory matters arising, but may under no circumstances exceed seven and a half years from the date of the offence. 35.Lastly, Article 120 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: “In cases in which publishing the decision on the merits may contribute to providing reparation for the damage, the court may, on application by an interested party, order the losing party to publish the decision at its own expense in one or more newspapers determined by the court. If the decision is not published within the period fixed by the court, the interested party may arrange for publication and shall retain the right to recover the costs from the losing party.” 36.In the resolution cited above, adopted on 18 September 1975, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe recommended that in their internal legislation and practice the governments of the member States be guided by the following principles: “1.Criminal proceedings should not be instituted or, if appropriate, sanctions shall not be imposed for manslaughter or accidental bodily injury resulting from a minor traffic offence, that is to say, a driving offence that was not such that its author must have been aware of the danger to which he exposed himself or others;>The same should apply, subject to the inexcusable character of the fault committed, in respect of a person who has caused manslaughter or accidental bodily injury if he himself or someone dear to him has been so badly injured that a sanction would be pointless, if not inhuman;>Application of the above-mentioned recommendations should in no way prejudice the rights of the victims to obtain compensation.”",2002,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

103,001-58496,Grand Chamber,"4.During the night of 15 to 16 December 1988, a series of offences occurred in Surrey, England. The first, which may have occurred sometime after 1.30 a.m., involved an attack on two men in a parked car in a field near a public house in Fickleshall. Just after the conclusion of sexual activities between the two men (Mr Ely and Mr Hurburgh), two masked men appeared. One carried a knife, the other a gun. Ely was pulled out of the car and 10 pounds sterling (GBP) was taken from him. On orders, he lay face down on the ground while the man with the knife kept guard over him. Ely became aware of a third masked man. The robbers wanted to take the car which belonged to Hurburgh, who objected and was attacked. Ely was made to crawl over to where Hurburgh was lying tied up. He was also tied up and gagged. Petrol was spread around both of them. Ely saw a lit cigarette and passed out. When he recovered consciousness, Hurburgh's Austin Princess car had gone and Hurburgh was dead. The attackers had abandoned a stolen Spitfire car in which they had arrived on the scene in the entrance to a field, about 500metres away.>This offence was followed, at about 3.40 a.m., by three masked robbers arriving at the Napier household in Oxted. They entered by a back window. Two of them went into Timothy Napier's room; one had a knife, the other a gun. Meanwhile, Richard Napier (the father) was awakened by the third robber armed with a revolver. He was taken into Timothy's room. Both were told they would be shot if they did not cooperate. They attacked the robbers and forced them downstairs. In the struggle, Timothy Napier's arm was cut and an artery was severed. Richard Napier was forced back upstairs to the bedroom where his wife was waiting. A knife was pointed at her and she was told to remove her rings and jewellery or her fingers would be cut off. The other two robbers ransacked the room before all three fled taking Timothy's Toyota car. Timothy Napier was rushed to hospital. He was found to have a stab wound to his back that had punctured the pleural cavity and required the insertion of a chest drain. Hurburgh's car was found abandoned nearby.>At 5 a.m., at the home of Mrs Spicer in Fetcham, she and her partner (MrAlmond) awoke to find three masked men in their bedroom. They were asked for money, jewellery and car keys. They told the intruders where to find them. Spicer and Almond were bound and gagged and the house was ransacked. It was nearly an hour before the robbers left, taking a large amount of property and the couple's two cars, a Renault and a Cavalier. Timothy Napier's Toyota was found abandoned nearby.>There was considerable interest in the above events, including publication in the national media between 17 and 19 December 1988 of the offer of a reward of GBP 25,000 for information leading to the conviction of the offenders. On Sunday 18 December the police incident room received information that the persons responsible for the murder and other offences were living at 25 Lawrie Park Road, Sydenham, South London (“No. 25”). In addition, the caller said that a considerable quantity of property which had been stolen during the course of the robberies had been taken by other persons resident at No. 25 and stored at the flat of a female associate at 71 Queen Adelaide Court.>No. 25 was owned by Mr Smith, who occupied the ground floor and basement. The remainder of the house, consisting of the two upper floors, was divided into flats occupied by the applicants, Raphael Rowe and Michael Davis, amongst others. Randolph Johnson visited the house from time to time, most recently to help repair the wiring and various electrical appliances, and he was said to have been there on the night of 15 December 1988. Rowe, Davis and Johnson were black.>Three white men also lived at No. 25: Mark Jobbins, Norman Duncan and Shane Griffin (“the Jobbins Group”). They were then aged 29, 21 and 19 years respectively. Duncan and Griffin sniffed glue on a regular basis. All three had criminal records. 10.As a result of the information received by the police, search warrants were obtained for each of the two addresses and were executed simultaneously at 7.50 a.m. on 19 December 1988. In a search of No. 25 carried out sometime between 2.15 p.m. on 19 December and 5 a.m. on 20 December, the police found a brooch from the Spicer/Almond robbery in Rowe's wastepaper basket. Other Spicer/Almond items were found in a storeroom and, also in the storeroom, were some porcelain figurines (not connected with these offences) which bore Davis's fingerprints. Blood stains on a jacket found in Rowe's bedroom were analysed and found to be of a blood group shared by 8% of the population, including the murder victim, Hurburgh. Rowe, Davis, Jobbins and Griffin were arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary. Duncan was arrested on 21 December. 11.Kate Williamson, a 16-year-old school student and girlfriend of Rowe, produced to the police a number of items from the Spicer/Almond robbery, including two eternity rings, a yellow metal watch strap and a lady's watch. She told them that she visited Rowe quite regularly and was there during the night of 15 December 1988. She said that she did not know Jobbins, Duncan or Griffin except by sight. 12.Joanne Cassar informed the police that she had stayed with another resident of No. 25, Jason Cooper, for a period in 1988. She knew Davis, Rowe, Jobbins, Duncan and Griffin. She had been at No. 25 during the night of 15 December 1988 and had stayed in Cooper's room. 13.The other search warrant was executed at 71 Queen Adelaide Court. It resulted in the arrest of the tenant, Bernadette Roberts, who was the girlfriend of Jobbins, and the recovery of a large amount of stolen property. 14.Johnson was arrested on 6 January 1989 after an extensive car chase by several police officers. At the time, he was carrying a revolver. In his statement he agreed that he had been to No. 25 on several occasions and, on the night in question, was probably there until late. He denied involvement in the offences and said in police interviews that he might have spent the night with a girlfriend. 15.The trial of the two applicants and Johnson took place at the Central Criminal Court in February 1990. 16.The prosecution case was that the three men had been involved in each incident. It was argued that there was evidence to link the offences: the Austin Princess stolen from Hurburgh was found at the scene of the Napier robbery; the Toyota stolen from the Napiers was found abandoned close to the Spicer/Almond household; and the vehicles stolen from the latter couple were connected to the occupants of No. 25. In addition, the witnesses to each of the robberies had described a team of three robbers, at least one of whom was carrying a gun and a second one a knife, dressed in black and wearing balaclavas. 17.The prosecution relied substantially upon the evidence of the Jobbins Group. The latter admitted having jointly stolen the Spitfire which had been found abandoned near the scene of the first robbery and murder, and having driven the Renault and Cavalier stolen at the last robbery to a field in Sidcup where they had set fire to them. They gave evidence, inter alia, that on the night of 15 to 16 December, Rowe had asked if he could use the Spitfire and that he, Davis and another black man had requested help in other ways, such as the loan of a balaclava and assistance in starting the Spitfire. The Jobbins Group also gave evidence relating to the events of the following morning (16 December), when Rowe had allegedly made a number of incriminating comments about his own involvement in the crimes and had requested them to dispose of the stolen Spicer/Almond cars and to store the stolen property elsewhere. 18.In addition, the prosecution relied on the evidence of Kate Williamson that Rowe had left her during the night of 15 to 16 December and had returned the following morning at 6.30 a.m.; that he gave her rings from the Napier robbery in order to have them valued; that he scratched his bedroom window with one of the diamond rings and that he told her about the stolen cars. The prosecution also relied on the evidence of Joanne Cassar, that she had been given a plant by Davis that, it was suggested, came from the boot of the car stolen from Almond. Finally, Martin Todd, an inmate at Her Majesty's Prison Brixton where Johnson had been held on remand, gave evidence of incriminating remarks allegedly made to him by Johnson. 19.All three of the accused denied any involvement in the offences. Their defence relied on the facts that Kate Williamson and others had given evidence that Rowe and Davis had been in their company at times during the night of 15 to 16 December which were inconsistent with a sighting of the Spitfire at a similar time close to the scene of the Hurburgh murder and that the victims of the offences, including Ely, the Napiers and Spicer, had described their attackers as white. On behalf of Johnson it was argued that there was no evidence of his involvement in the preparatory acts or subsequent disposals. 20.The defence submitted that many of the witnesses for the prosecution were unreliable. Thus, Ely's evidence included a number of inconsistencies, as did the testimony and statements of the Jobbins Group. It was argued that if anyone from No. 25 had been responsible for the crimes, it was the Jobbins Group, and that Jobbins, Duncan and Griffin had given a deliberately false account to the police in order to implicate the accused and thus exonerate themselves. Joanne Cassar may have been an accomplice because she knew Duncan and Griffin, and Kate Williamson's evidence may have been motivated by jealousy of Rowe's relationship with another girlfriend and was in any event inconsistent with a letter which she had sent to Rowe whilst he was in prison. The defence sought to impugn Todd's evidence on the grounds that he may have lied in order to obtain parole. In addition, the defence referred to the substantial reward which had been offered as a factor which may have motivated prosecution witnesses to give evidence. 21.Davis gave evidence, consistent with his statement to the police, that he had played no part in the offences and had had nothing to do with the Spitfire. He claimed to have spent the evening of 15 December at home, and agreed with Kate Williamson's account of going out and not returning until about 12.30 a.m. Rowe's evidence was also consistent with his statement to the police. He denied having played any part in the offences and said that after returning to No. 25 at 12.30 a.m., he had then slept with KateWilliamson throughout the night. Johnson did not give evidence. 22.On 26 February 1990 the jury returned unanimous verdicts convicting the applicants and Johnson of murder, assault occasioning grievous bodily harm, and three counts of robbery. They were each sentenced to concurrent terms of life, fifteen years' and twelve years' imprisonment. 23.The applicants and Johnson appealed on the grounds, inter alia, that their convictions were unsafe and unsatisfactory because of weaknesses and inconsistencies in the evidence against them. 24.On 20 October 1992, at the first hearing before the Court of Appeal, counsel for the prosecution handed to the court a document which was not shown to defence counsel. He sought the Court of Appeal's ruling on a matter of disclosure (see paragraphs 34-35 below), and informed the court that the matter was sensitive to a degree which would require the court to hear him either ex parte or, if inter partes, only on an undertaking by defence counsel not to disclose what took place to their solicitors or clients. Both defence counsel indicated that they could not conscientiously give such an undertaking and withdrew from the hearing, which proceeded ex parte. 25.On 14 and 15 January 1993 the issue of disclosure was re-canvassed before a differently constituted Court of Appeal (although the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, participated in both hearings), because defence counsel had reconsidered their position and had concluded that they had been incorrect in withdrawing voluntarily as they had done at the first hearing. It was argued by the defence that (i) defence counsel should have been permitted to hear the application by the Crown without giving an undertaking and (ii) counsel for the Crown should, at the least, have been obliged to disclose the category of material in question so that defence counsel could then have made submissions as to whether or not disclosure of material in that category should be ordered. The Court of Appeal, in its judgment, remarked that the procedure to be followed when the prosecution was in possession of material which it believed should not be disclosed to the defence had been changed by the judgment in R. v. Ward (see paragraph 37 below) in that it was now for the court, and not the prosecution, to decide whether disclosure should be made, and set out a series of procedural guidelines to be followed in such cases (see paragraphs 39-40 below). In conclusion, however, it refused to order disclosure. 26.On 22 June 1993, at the outset of the hearing of the substantive appeal before a differently constituted Court of Appeal, defence counsel invited the court to order the Crown to disclose the name of any person or persons to whom any reward money had been paid for information given to the police concerning the applicants, and sought access to the Police Complaints Authority Report concerning a complaint by Rowe. The prosecution showed the court documents relevant to the request for disclosure which were not shown to the defence. However, defence counsel were able to make submissions as to the factors weighing in favour of disclosure and the nature of the balancing exercise to be undertaken by the court. Having considered those submissions and having examined the relevant documents, the court refused to order disclosure. 27.On 29 July 1993 the Court of Appeal upheld the applicants' convictions and that of Johnson, concluding that there was no basis to say that there was even a lurking doubt about their safety. 28.The applicants applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal to the House of Lords, but this application was refused on 30 September 1993. 29.By a letter of 27 November 1994 the first applicant's solicitor, with reference to R. v. Rasheed (see paragraph 42 below), asked the Crown Prosecution Service for disclosure of any reward claim made prior to the trial by any witness and, in particular, by one of the Jobbins Group, Williamson or Cassar. 30.On 22 November 1995 the Crown Prosecution Service replied: “Regarding the question raised in paragraph (1) of your letter of 27th October 1994, you will know that the topic of rewards was raised by [defence counsel] at the outset of the appeal in this matter. This resulted in an ex parte application which was heard in camera. This application was upheld and referred to by Watkins LJ in his final judgment in these terms: 'We upheld the claim and refused to order disclosure of any kind for reasons we gave on 22nd June and which are recorded'.” 31.In 1994 the applicants applied to the Home Office for a review of the safety of their convictions. In April 1997 the Criminal Cases Review Commission (“the CCRC”) was set up under the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 and the applicants' case was transferred to it. In August 1997 the CCRC appointed an officer from Greater Manchester Police to investigate the events surrounding the prosecution of the applicants and Johnson. The investigating officer's report was submitted in January 1999. 32.In its report of 7 April 1999 the CCRC found, inter alia, that Duncan was a long-standing police informant, who, on 18 December 1988 had approached a Sussex police officer and told him that the applicants were responsible for the crimes of 15 to 16 December 1988. As a result of his assistance to the police and the evidence which he gave at the applicants' trial, Duncan had received a reward of GBP 10,300, in addition to police protection between 18 and 22 December 1988 and immunity from prosecution in relation to his admitted participation as an accessory to the offences in question. It appeared from police records of the information supplied by Duncan that the latter had never identified Johnson as one of the offenders. These facts had not previously been disclosed to the defence on grounds of public interest immunity. The CCRC also found that “the police were not keen that the Jobbins Group should be prosecuted and there was a corresponding inertia on the part of the prosecuting authorities”, and commented that “if the jury had been aware of this then the credibility of the Jobbins Group might have been assessed in a more critical manner”. Moreover, Todd had retracted his statement concerning the incriminating comments allegedly made by Johnson. The CCRC concluded that, in the light of this new evidence, there was a real possibility that Johnson was not involved in the offences of 15 to 16December 1988. Whilst there was evidence linking the two applicants to the robberies, if the prosecution case against one of the three, Johnson, might no longer be sustainable, in the CCRC's view the Court of Appeal ought at the same time to have the opportunity to consider whether the case could still be sustained against Rowe and Davis. It therefore referred the convictions of the applicants and Johnson back to the Court of Appeal, since it considered that there was a real possibility that these convictions would not be upheld if such a reference were made (Criminal Appeal Act 1995, section 13). 33.At the time of the adoption of the present judgment the applicants' case is pending before the Court of Appeal. 34.At common law, the prosecution has a duty to disclose any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial. The duty also extends to statements of any witnesses potentially favourable to the defence. 35.In December 1981 the Attorney-General issued Guidelines, which did not have the force of law, concerning exceptions to the common-law duty to disclose to the defence certain evidence of potential assistance to it ([1982] 74 Criminal Appeal Reports 302: “the Guidelines”). The Guidelines attempted to codify the rules of disclosure and to define the prosecution's power to withhold “unused material”. Under paragraph 1, “unused material” was defined as: “(i)All witness statements and documents which are not included in the committal bundle served on the defence; (ii) the statements of any witnesses who are to be called to give evidence at the committal and (if not in the bundle) any documents referred to therein; (iii) the unedited version(s) of any edited statements or composite statement included in the committal bundles.” Under paragraph 2, any item falling within this definition was to be made available to the defence if “... it ha[d] some bearing on the offence(s) charged and the surrounding circumstances of the case”. 36.According to the Guidelines, the duty to disclose was subject to a discretionary power for prosecuting counsel to withhold relevant evidence if it fell within one of the categories set out in paragraph 6. One of these categories (6(iv)) was “sensitive” material which, because of its sensitivity, it would not be in the public interest to disclose. “Sensitive material” was defined as follows: “... (a) it deals with matters of national security; or it is by, or discloses the identity of, a member of the Security Services who would be of no further use to those services once his identity became known; (b) it is by, or discloses the identity of an informant and there are reasons for fearing that the disclosure of his identity would put him or his family in danger; (c) it is by, or discloses the identity of a witness who might be in danger of assault or intimidation if his identity became known; (d) it contains details which, if they became known, might facilitate the commission of other offences or alert someone not in custody that he is a suspect; or it discloses some unusual form of surveillance or method of detecting crime; (e) it is supplied only on condition that the contents will not be disclosed, at least until a subpoena has been served upon the supplier – e.g. a bank official; (f) it relates to other offences by, or serious allegations against, someone who is not an accused, or discloses previous convictions or other matters prejudicial to him; (g) it contains details of private delicacy to the maker and/or might create risk of domestic strife.” According to paragraph 8, “in deciding whether or not statements containing sensitive material should be disclosed, a balance should be struck between the degree of sensitivity and the extent to which the information might assist the defence”. The decision as to whether or not the balance in a particular case required disclosure of sensitive material was one for the prosecution, although any doubt should be resolved in favour of disclosure. If either before or during the trial it became apparent that a duty to disclose had arisen, but that disclosure would not be in the public interest because of the sensitivity of the material, the prosecution would have to be abandoned. 37.Subsequent to the applicants' trial in 1990, but before the appeal proceedings in October 1992-July 1993, the Guidelines were superseded by the common law. In R. v. Ward ([1993] 1 Weekly Law Reports 619) the Court of Appeal dealt with the duties of the prosecution to disclose evidence to the defence and the proper procedure to be followed when the prosecution claimed public interest immunity. It stressed that the court and not the prosecution was to be the judge of where the proper balance lay in a particular case, because: “... [When] the prosecution acted as judge in their own cause on the issue of public interest immunity in this case they committed a significant number of errors which affected the fairness of the proceedings. Policy considerations therefore powerfully reinforce the view that it would be wrong to allow the prosecution to withhold material documents without giving any notice of that fact to the defence. If, in a wholly exceptional case, the prosecution are not prepared to have the issue of public interest immunity determined by a court, the result must inevitably be that the prosecution will have to be abandoned.” The Court of Appeal described the balancing exercise to be performed by the judge as follows: “... a judge is balancing on the one hand the desirability of preserving the public interest in the absence of disclosure against, on the other hand, the interests of justice. Where the interests of justice arise in a criminal case touching and concerning liberty or conceivably on occasion life, the weight to be attached to the interests of justice is plainly very great indeed.” 38.In R. v. Trevor Douglas K. ([1993] 97 Criminal Appeal Reports 342), the Court of Appeal emphasised that, in performing the balancing exercise referred to in Ward, the court must view the material itself: “In our judgment the exclusion of the evidence without an opportunity of testing its relevance and importance amounted to a material irregularity. When public interest immunity is claimed for a document, it is for the court to rule whether the claim should be upheld or not. To do that involves a balancing exercise. The exercise can only be performed by the judge himself examining or viewing the evidence, so as to have the facts of what it contains in mind. Only then can he be in a position to balance the competing interests of public interest immunity and fairness to the party claiming disclosure.” This judgment also clarified that, where an accused appeals to the Court of Appeal on the ground that material has been wrongly withheld, the Court of Appeal will itself view the material ex parte. 39.In R. v. Davis, Johnson and Rowe ([1993] 1 Weekly Law Reports 613), the Court of Appeal held that it was not necessary in every case for the prosecution to give notice to the defence when it wished to claim public interest immunity, and outlined three different procedures to be adopted. The first procedure, which had generally to be followed, was for the prosecution to give notice to the defence that they were applying for a ruling by the court and indicate to the defence at least the category of the material which they held. The defence then had the opportunity to make representations to the court. Secondly, however, where the disclosure of the category of the material in question would in effect reveal that which the prosecution contended should not be revealed, the prosecution should still notify the defence that an application to the court was to be made, but the category of the material need not be disclosed and the application should be ex parte. The third procedure would apply in an exceptional case where to reveal even the fact that an ex parte application was to be made would in effect be to reveal the nature of the evidence in question. In such cases the prosecution should apply to the court ex parte without notice to the defence. 40.The Court of Appeal observed that, although ex parte applications limited the rights of the defence, in some cases the only alternative would be to require the prosecution to choose between following an inter partes procedure or declining to prosecute, and in rare but serious cases the abandonment of a prosecution in order to protect sensitive evidence would be contrary to the public interest. It referred to the important role performed by the trial judge in monitoring the views of the prosecution as to the proper balance to be struck and remarked that even in cases in which the sensitivity of the information required an ex parte hearing, the defence had “as much protection as can be given without pre-empting the issue”. Finally, it emphasised that it was for the trial judge to continue to monitor the position as the trial progressed. Issues might emerge during the trial which affected the balance and required disclosure “in the interests of securing fairness to the defendant”. For this reason it was important for the same judge who heard any disclosure application also to conduct the trial. 41.Following the applicants' appeal, the English courts further clarified the principles and procedures relating to the issue of disclosure. In R. v. Keane ([1994] 1 Weekly Law Reports 747) the Court of Appeal emphasised that, since the ex parte procedure outlined in R. v. Davis, Johnson and Rowe was “contrary to the general principle of open justice in criminal trials”, it should be used only in exceptional cases. It would be an abdication of the prosecution's duty if, out of an abundance of caution, it were simply “to dump all its unused material in the court's lap and leave it to the judge to sort through it regardless of its materiality to the issues present or potential”. Thus, the prosecution should put before the court only those documents which it regarded as material but wished to withhold. “Material” evidence was that which could, on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution, be seen (i) to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case; (ii) to raise or possibly raise a new issue the existence of which was not apparent from the evidence the prosecution proposed to use; or (iii) to hold out a real (as opposed to fanciful) prospect of providing a lead of evidence going to (i) or (ii). Exceptionally, in case of doubt about the materiality of the documents or evidence, the court might be asked to rule on the issue. In order to assist the prosecution in deciding whether evidence in its possession was “material”, and the judge in performing the balancing exercise, it was open to the defence to indicate any defence or issue which they proposed to raise. 42.In R. v. Rasheed (The Times, 20 May 1994), the Court of Appeal held that a failure by the prosecution to disclose the fact that a prosecution witness whose evidence was challenged had applied for or received a reward for giving information was a material irregularity which justified overturning a conviction. 43.In R. v. Winston Brown ([1995] 1 Criminal Appeal Reports 191), the Court of Appeal reviewed the operation of the Guidelines. It stated: “The Attorney-General's objective was no doubt to improve the existing practice of disclosure by the Crown. That was a laudable objective. But the Attorney-General was not trying to make law and it was certainly beyond his power to do so ... The Guidelines are merely a set of instructions to Crown Prosecution Service lawyers and prosecuting counsel ... Judged simply as a set of instructions to prosecutors, the Guidelines would be unobjectionable if they exactly matched the contours of the common law duty of disclosure ... But if the Guidelines, judged by the standards of today, reduce the common law duties of the Crown and thus abridge the common law rights of a defendant, they must be pro tanto unlawful... [T]oday, the Guidelines do not conform to the requirements of the law of disclosure in a number of critically important respects. First, the judgment in Ward established that it is for the court, not prosecuting counsel, to decide on disputed questions as to discloseable materials, and on any asserted legal ground to withhold production of relevant material ... For present purposes the point of supreme importance is that there is no hint in the Guidelines of the primacy of the court in deciding on issues of disclosure ... Secondly, the Guidelines are not an exhaustive statement of the Crown's common law duty of disclosure: R. v. Ward at 25 and 681D. To that extent too the Guidelines are out of date. Thirdly, the Guidelines were drafted before major developments in the field of public interest immunity. [I]n paragraph 6 the Guidelines are cast in the form of a prosecutor's discretion ... Much of what is listed as 'sensitive material' is no doubt covered by public interest immunity. But not everything so listed is covered by public interest immunity ...” 44.In the case of R. v. Turner ([1995] 1 Weekly Law Reports 264), the Court of Appeal returned to the balancing exercise, stating, inter alia: “Since R. v. Ward ... there has been an increasing tendency for defendants to seek disclosure of informants' names and roles, alleging that those details are essential to the defence. Defences that the accused has been set up, and allegations of duress, which used at one time to be rare, have multiplied. We wish to alert judges to the need to scrutinise applications for disclosure of details about informants with very great care. They will need to be astute to see that assertions of a need to know such details, because they are essential to the running of the defence, are justified. If they are not so justified, then the judge will need to adopt a robust approach in declining to order disclosure. Clearly, there is a distinction between cases in which the circumstances raise no reasonable possibility that information about the informant will bear upon the issues and cases where it will. Again, there will be cases where the informant is an informant and no more; other cases where he may have participated in the events constituting, surrounding, or following the crime. Even when the informant has participated, the judge will need to consider whether his role so impinges on an issue of interest to the defence, present or potential, as to make disclosure necessary ... It is sufficient for us to say that in this case we are satisfied that the information concerning the informant showed a participation in the events concerning this crime which, coupled with the way in which the defence was raised from the very first moment by the defendant when he said that he was being set up, gave rise to the need for the defence to be aware of the identity of the informant and his role in this matter. We, therefore, conclude that if one applies the principle which has been quoted from R. v. Keane ... to the facts of the present case, there could only be one answer to the question as to whether the details concerning this informer were so important to the issues of interest to the defence, present and potential, that the balance which the judge had to strike came down firmly in favour of disclosure.” 45.In 1996 a new statutory scheme covering disclosure by the prosecution came into force in England and Wales. Under the 1996 Act, the prosecution must make “primary disclosure” of all previously undisclosed evidence which, in the prosecutor's view, might undermine the case for the prosecution. The defendant must then give a defence statement to the prosecution and the court, setting out in general terms the nature of the defence and the matters on which the defence takes issue with the prosecution. The prosecution must then make a “secondary disclosure” of all previously undisclosed material “which might reasonably be expected to assist the accused's defence as disclosed by the defence statement”. Disclosure by the prosecution may be subject to challenge by the accused and review by the trial court. 46.Following the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in Chahal v. the United Kingdom (15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V) and Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom (10 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV) the United Kingdom has introduced legislation making provision for the appointment of a “special counsel” in certain cases involving national security. The provisions are contained in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 (“the 1997 Act”) and the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”). Under this legislation, where it is necessary on national security grounds for the relevant tribunal to sit in camera, in the absence of the affected individual and his or her legal representatives, the Attorney-General may appoint a special counsel to represent the interests of the individual in the proceedings. The legislation provides that the special counsel is not however “responsible to the person whose interest he is appointed to represent”, thus ensuring that the special counsel is both entitled and obliged to keep confidential any information which cannot be disclosed. 47.For example, in the immigration context, the relevant Rules under the 1997 Act are contained in the Special Immigration Appeals Act Commission (Procedure) Rules 1998 (Statutory Instrument no. 1998/1881). Rule 3 provides that in exercising its functions, the Commission shall secure that information is not disclosed contrary to the interests of national security, the international relations of the United Kingdom, the detection and prevention of crime, or in any other circumstances where disclosure is likely to harm the public interest. Rule 7 relates to the special advocate established by section 6 of the 1997 Act. It provides, inter alia: “7.... (4)The function of the special advocate is to represent the interest of the appellant by - (a)making submissions to the Commission in any proceedings from which the appellant or his representative are excluded; (b)cross-examining witnesses at any such proceedings; and (c)making written submissions to the Commission. (5)Except in accordance with paragraphs (6) to (9) the special advocate may not communicate directly or indirectly with the appellant or his representative on any matter connected with proceedings before the Commission. (6)The special advocate may communicate with the appellant and his representative at any time before the Secretary of State makes the material available to him. (7)At any time after the Secretary of State has made the material available under Rule 10(3), the special advocate may seek directions from the Commission authorising him to seek information in connection with the proceedings from the appellant or his representative. (8)The Commission shall notify the Secretary of State of a request for direction under paragraph (7) and the Secretary of State must, within a period specified by the Commission, give the Commission notice of any objection which he has to the request for information being made or to the form in which it is proposed to be made. (9)Where the Secretary of State makes an objection under paragraph (8), Rule 11 shall apply as appropriate.” Rules 10 and 11, to which Rule 7 refers, provide: “10.(1)If the Secretary of State intends to oppose the appeal, he must, no later than 42 days after receiving a copy of the notice of appeal - (a)provide the Commission with a summary of the facts relating to the decision being appealed and the reasons for the decision; (b)inform the Commission of the grounds on which he opposes the appeal; and (c)provide the Commission with a statement of the evidence which he relies upon in support of those grounds. (2)Where the Secretary of State objects to material referred to in paragraph (1) being disclosed to the appellant or his representative, he must also - (a)state the reasons for the objection; and (b)if and to the extent it is possible to do so without disclosing information contrary to the public interest, provide a statement of that material in a form that can be shown to the appellant. (3)Where he makes an objection under paragraph (2), the Secretary of State must make available to the special advocate, as soon as it is practicable to do so, the material which he has provided to the Commission under paragraphs (1) and (2). 11.(1)Proceedings under this Rule shall take place in the absence of the appellant and his representative. (2)The Commission shall decide whether to uphold the Secretary of State's objection. (3)Before doing so it shall invite the special advocate to make written representations. (4)After considering representations made under paragraph (3) the Commission may - (a)invite the special advocate to make oral representations; or (b)uphold the Secretary of State's objections without requiring further representations from the special advocate. (5)Where the Commission is minded to overrule the Secretary of State's objection, or to require him to provide material in different form from that in which he has provided it under Rule 10(2)(b), the Commission must invite the Secretary of State and the special advocate to make oral representations. (6)Where - (a)the Commission overrules the Secretary of State's objection or requires him to provide material in different form from that in which he has provided it under Rule10(2)(b), and (b)the Secretary of State wishes to oppose the appeal, he shall not be required to disclose any material which was the subject of the unsuccessful objection if he chooses not to rely upon it in opposing the appeal.” 48.In the context of fair employment proceedings in Northern Ireland, the scheme under sections 90 to 92 of the 1998 Act and the relevant Rules is identical to the mechanism adopted under the 1997 Act (above). 49.In addition, the government has recently placed before Parliament two bills which make provision for the appointment of “special counsel” (operating under the same conditions) in other circumstances. The Electronic Communications Bill 1999 provides for the appointment of a “special representative” in proceedings before an Electronic Communications Tribunal to be established for the purpose of examining complaints relating to the interception and interpretation of electronic communications. In the context of criminal proceedings, the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Bill 1999 makes provision for the appointment by the court of a special counsel in any case in which a trial judge prohibits an unrepresented defendant from cross-examining in person the complainant in a sexual offence.",2000,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

32,001-58277,Grand Chamber,"7.MrAhmet Zeki Okçuoğlu is a Turk of Kurdish origin and was born in 1950. He lives in Istanbul and works as a lawyer.>In May 1991, a magazine, “Demokrat” (Democrat), published in its issue no. 12 an article on a round-table debate it had organised under the chairmanship of Mr M.İ.S. in which the applicant had taken part. The applicant’s comments were recorded in the article, entitled “The past and present of the Kurdish problem” (Kürt Sorununun Dünü ve Bugünü), as follows: “M.İ.S. – Leaving aside the humanitarian side to the current tragic plight of the Kurds in Iraq, there are important political aspects to the problem, the main one perhaps being the intensification, with the crisis in the Gulf, of relations at international level between the Kurdish movements. At this stage, one question needs to be asked: what did we hope to gain from the relations established with the United States and the European States and what have we in fact achieved? ... If you would allow me to, I should like to return to the question ... of the orchestrating of developments in the regional situation, mainly by the United States and the West,... Mr Okçuoğlu, could I ask you to frame your answer in the context of the unitary State? A.Z. Okçuoğlu – Your question is badly put. It involves certain ideological considerations. Before answering, I think I should explain what the Kurdish question is about. It concerns a nation of some 40,000,000 people, one which has existed in the region since history began and one which has, in company with the other nations established here, played a major role historically; but it is also a nation which has, since the beginning of this century and under the influence of the international and regional powers, been deprived of its national rights, seen its territory divided up between the States in the region and been divested of its sovereign rights so as to be subjected instead to the hegemony of other States. If we are to make progress on this question, that must be the starting point. Admittedly, that does not mean to say that a radical solution to the problem will be found from one day to the next. Coming back to your question ... the idea that the Kurdish problem has been fuelled by outside forces, by imperialist powers, is not new. For about a century some observers have seen the problem in those terms. The underlying reasons may be summarised as follows. Firstly, there are the concerns of the nations which keep the Kurds under their domination. From the beginning, those powers have attempted to assert that the problem is that the Kurds are not a national entity, have no claims of their own and are manipulated by outside forces. Their aim, then, is to prevent international powers intervening in the problem and to cast doubt on its legitimacy and to distract attention from it. There is also the international socialist movement and the doctrine of imperialism which prevails in such circles. As you know, the Soviet Union was akin to an empire in the classic sense. The Soviet Government has always been against the Kurds as it considered that, if it the Kurds were given certain rights, the nations it controlled by force would inevitably also assert claims, and discussion of such issues at the international level would render its networks less inaccessible. That is why the Soviets have since the days of Lenin consistently sided with the powers who have kept the Kurds under their domination and why the local socialist satellite powers have invariably put forward similar arguments. Given the negative attitude of these socialist powers towards the Kurds, the relationship between the sovereign power of the former and the official ideology of the latter has also played a role. That attitude was reinforced by the Soviet position. Soviet ideology is in itself an ideology of the sovereign nation. In that regard, the ideology of Soviet sovereignty and the Turkish national ideology as applied in the region were at one. However, the said doctrine of imperialism does not end there. After the seventies, the Kurds, under the influence of Soviet and Chinese socialist propaganda, whether consciously or subconconsciously, adopted the same tack. That led the Kurdish movement into a series of dead ends. The allegation that the Kurdish problem arose as a result of provocations from outside is ill-founded. If one has to speak of imperialist protectionism in the Middle East, it will be noted that it has been of no benefit to the Kurds, whereas, shielded by the imperialist powers concerned, the Turks, the Arabs and the Persians have done quite well. If the British had not intervened in favour of the Ottomans in the Crimean War, the Russian Tsar would have expurgated the Ottoman State from the history books and would have seized the Byzantine heritage. Contrary to what is suggested by some left-wing historians, the imperialists tried to save the ‘sick man’ rather than to kill him. That applies to the Arabs, too. Up till now, the only people in the Middle East – if you except the Palestinians – who have fought for their national rights are the Kurdish people. The Turks, Arabs and Persians have not fired a single bullet for their national rights. Not a shot was fired when the British invaded the Ottoman State in 1918. The so-called war of independence was merely a consequence of an historical conflict between the Greeks and the Turks. The question of who was right is a controversial one. The resistance against the French, launched at Antep and Urfa, was Kurdish. More precisely, it was Turco-Kurdish resistance that developed under the aegis of the local authorities. It was the spontaneous resistance of the people. Neither the Turkish army nor the political authorities played any part in it. The Kurds have fallen behind in obtaining their national rights not, as is suggested in certain quarters, because they are dependent on external powers, but, on the contrary, because they have failed to forge international relations and because the international powers have refused them admission. While the Kurdish problem is the problem of the Kurds, its solution is also of concern to the regional and international powers as it directly affects their interests. The question cannot be dealt with using concepts, such as imperialism, anti-imperialism, socialism and anti-socialism, that bear scant resemblance to the true position. You cannot say: ‘It’s our problem. You, the United States, England, the Soviets, the Turks, don’t interfere; you, the Arabs, the Persians, stay out of this’. We must solve the problem with all those whose interests are at stake. With or without their help. There, too, it has to be said that of all the parties involved in the Kurdish problem, it is the Kurds who have taken the least initiative. So, the Kurds must be realistic. As the question concerns their existence and is posed at a time when their efforts have been minimal, it would be foolhardy to attempt to solve the problems by denying that initiatives have been taken or opposing them. In practice, the Kurds must on this point work out how and to what extent they can play a bigger role in finding a solution to the problem. That would be the practical approach. ... M.İ.S. – I wouldn’t want you to take what I said the wrong way. I do not suggest that the Kurdish revolt is dependent on imperialist factors. All I say is that the countries in the region do not have the resources to solve the problems that exist here by themselves. Accordingly, the continued presence of the international powers seems likely. Under those circumstances, how can the Kurds play a greater role? A.Z. Okçuoğlu – Firstly, when considering the Kurdish problem the international powers are mindful of their own interests. We have to be aware of that and determine where our common interest lies. There are a number of nations like the Kurds in the world. Although the United Nations Charter and the fundamental treaties refer to peoples’ right to self-determination, it is not in practice accepted that that right applies to the Kurds, any more than it is accepted that it applies to a series of other nations. Such nations only manage to obtain certain humanitarian and cultural rights that do not extend beyond the boundaries of the countries in which they live. None of them have been able to achieve more than that. The problems of peoples confined to minority status cannot readily be referred to and resolved without taking this factor into account. All the boundaries need changing, but that is very difficult to achieve. For that reason, I believe that the Kurds have committed an error of judgement. By that I do not mean that they must accept their present status right to the bitter end. If they wish to enter the history books, they have to be aware of the international implications their presence entails. I would add that I attach no credit to the idea that the Kurds have been ‘deceived or sold’. Recently, the United States cautioned them to act with restraint; they broke off their relations with Talabani and turned down all his requests for arms. In my view, the Kurds have committed an error of judgement. They have adopted a quite radical approach, one for which the organisations of Iraqi Kurdistan cannot be held responsible. The Kurds, believing Saddam to be finished, attempted to rise up spontaneously in reaction to the oppression to which they have been subjected for years. Barzani and Talabani, in company with the other Kurdish leaders, were forced to accept that process. We are not strong enough to face the likes of America, France, the Soviets or a Saddam exhausted to the point where he is no longer able to stay on his feet. We have to examine the problem in the light of these realities. The urgent need is to ensure the democratic unity of the Kurds. We must abandon the notion of hostility. No side is strong enough to destroy the other and in any event there is no reason to come to that. Our relations should be friendly, not hostile. Similarly, when we forge relations with the western powers, it is necessary and even essential to afford preference to national values. ... For my part, I am opposed to the definition of primitive nationalism that has often been asserted in recent times. The use of such terminology sometimes reveals a lack of discernment. Nationalism takes two known forms. The first is that of the oppressor nation, the second that of the nation that is oppressed. Beyond that, scientific research into nationalism has not come up with any other definition. It is difficult to know what the notion of ‘primitive nationalism’ covers: does it dismiss nationalism wholesale or does it suggest another form of nationalism? It is unclear. Besides, this terminology is unscientific, of no value and merely serves to reflect certain absurd political preoccupations. I do not subscribe to the theory that the Kurds’ lack of success is due to primitive nationalism. In fact, it is not the Kurds who are responsible for their lack of success. The reasons for it are to be found in the international status of the Kurds. A number of nations in the world are in the same position as the Kurds. None of them has had, up till now, an opportunity to draw its own frontiers, whether by force of arms or otherwise. How can we expect the Kurds to be given an opportunity that has been offered to no other nation? Let us take the example of Lithuania. The Lithuanians had organised a referendum on the question of their independence and had subsequently declared themselves independent by an overwhelming majority. Yet when the United States gave their approval, the Soviets invaded with tanks. Lithuania was isolated. We have to speak therefore with the benefit of hindsight. Since the beginning of the century the struggle has continued in Iraqi Kurdistan. The only people engaged in combat in the Middle East are the Kurdish people. Despite that, their position has not improved at all. The Kurds will certainly find a solution to their problem, but one must be aware that the factors coming into play do not depend solely on the Kurds. I should now like to clarify the notion of nationalism about which so much has been said. As you know, nationalist movements began in the west with the French Revolution and subsequently spread to Asia and Africa. The colonies were freed as a result of nationalism. However, the issue of nationality remains alive. There continue to be peoples who have been deprived of their national rights. If they are to be freed they must show nationalist sentiment. The fact that nationalist movements attract an imprecatory reaction from those whom they cause to suffer is understandable. Conversely, it is impossible to comprehend why people who claim to be on the side of the oppressed, who call themselves revolutionaries or innovators, should react in a similar fashion. The nationalism of the oppressed nation cannot be considered to be a usurpation of the rights of another nation. On the contrary, I believe that internationalism in the modern sense is inherent in nationalism. I do not approve of lumping together all kinds of nationalism, without being aware of the difference between the nationalism of the oppressor nation and the nationalism of the nation that is oppressed. If you ignore that difference, then you are serving the cause of the oppressor nation. Why do Turkish socialists, who outlaw Kurdish nationalism, not take a look at themselves? They defend the staunchest nationalism of all time, namely Kemalism, yet they ban Kurdish nationalism. Prohibiting an oppressed nation from being nationalistic is to condemn it to slavery. My friend S. consistently holds the same line. His politics are always reactionary. The Kurds may react, but building a policy on the back of that reaction will not achieve much. In politics, one doesn’t have friends or enemies, one has interests. Furthermore, politics is the art of seeking the feasible. Is the position of people who criticise advocates of autonomy and of Kurdish independence any different from that reached by the Kurdish national movement in Iraq? Not at all. In Turkey, too, some benefit has been gained, but not from policies geared towards independence. Those in favour of independence may on occasion agree voluntarily to limit their demands saying: ‘Decree a general amnesty, allow us to get organised’. They even add: ‘We don’t want a separation’. Such policies cannot be brought to fruition with plays on words. Today, the Kurds must come up with medium-term policies that are adapted to the international context.”>On 10 June 1991 the Public Prosecutor of the Istanbul National Security Court no. 2 (“National Security Court”) accused the applicant of disseminating propaganda against the “indivisibility of the State”. Relying on the comments set out above (see paragraph 8 above), he requested the application of section 8(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no.3713 – see paragraph 17 below) and confiscation of the copies of the relevant issue of the aforementioned magazine (see paragraph 16 below). 10.The applicant denied the charges before the National Security Court, arguing, in particular, that he had never intended to promote separatism. 11. On 11 March 1993 the National Security Court, composed of three judges, including a military judge, found the applicant guilty of the offence charged and sentenced him under section 8(1) of Law no. 3713 to one year, eight months’ imprisonment and a fine of 41,666,666 Turkish liras (“TRL”), to be paid in twenty monthly instalments. It also ordered confiscation of the publications concerned. After verifying that the document in issue was an accurate transcription of what had been said at the round-table debate in which the applicant had taken part, the National Security Court found, inter alia, that in his comments, the applicant had asserted that some Turkish nationals had been deprived of their “national rights” as a result of their Kurdish origin and that their territory had been divided up between the States in the region concerned. According to the applicant, the Kurdish population – dominated by these States – was fighting to acquire its national rights. The National Security Court held that those comments, taken as a whole, amounted to separatist propaganda that was detrimental to the unity of the Turkish nation and the territorial integrity of the Turkish State and justified Mr Okçuoğlu’s conviction. 12.In a judgment of 24 September 1993, the Court of Cassation dismissed an appeal by the applicant. 13.On 20 February 1995, at the applicant’s request, the National Security Court agreed to deduct from the applicant’s sentence the period from 28 October to 18 November 1990 which he had spent in pre-trial detention in connection with earlier criminal proceedings. Consequently, he was granted automatic parole. The applicant paid the fine that had been imposed on him that same day. 14.On 30 October 1995 Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995 came into force. Inter alia, it reduced the length of prison sentences that could be imosed under section 8 of Law no. 3713 while increasing the level of fines (see paragraph 17 below). In a transitional provision relating to section 2, Lawno. 4126 provided that sentences imposed pursuant to section 8 of Law no.3713 would be automatically reviewed (see paragraph 18 below). 15.Consequently, the National Security Court reviewed the applicant’s case on the merits. In its judgment of 8 March 1996 it reduced MrOkçuoğlu’s prison sentence to one year, one month and ten days but increased the fine to TRL 111,111,110. 16.Article 36 § 1 of the Criminal Code reads as follows: Article 36 § 1 “In the event of conviction, the court shall order the seizure and confiscation of any object which has been used for the commission or preparation of the crime or offence...” 17.The Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713 of 12 April 1991), has been amended by Law no 4126 of 27 October 1995, which came into force on 30 October 1995 (see paragraph 18 below). Sections 8 and 13 read as follows: Former section 8 § 1 “Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited, irrespective of the methods used and the intention. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than two and not more than five years’ imprisonment and a fine of from fifty million to one hundred million Turkish liras.” New section 8 §§ 1 and 3 “Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than one and not more than three years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras. The penalty imposed on a reoffender may not be commuted to a fine. ... Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of printed matter or by means of mass communication other than periodicals within the meaning of the second paragraph, those responsible and the owners of the means of mass communication shall be sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras... ...” Former section 13 “The penalties for the offences contemplated in the present law may not be commuted to a fine or any other measure, nor may they be accompanied by a reprieve.” New section 13 “The penalties for the offences contemplated in the present Law may not be commuted to a fine or any other measure, nor may they be accompanied by a reprieve. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply to convictions pursuant to section 8.” 18.The Law of 27 October 1995 contains a “transitional provision relating to section 2” that applies to the amendments which that law makes to the sentencing provisions of section 8 of Law no. 3713. That transitional provision provides: “In the month following the entry into force of the present Law, the court which has given judgment shall re-examine the case of a person convicted pursuant to section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) and, in accordance with the amendment... to section 8 of Law no. 3713, shall reconsider the term of imprisonment imposed on that person and decide whether he should be allowed the benefit of sections 4 and 6 of Law no. 647 of 13 July 1965.” 19.The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure concerning the grounds on which defendants may appeal on points of law against judgments of courts of first instance read as follows: Article 307 “An appeal on points of law may not concern any issue other than the lawfulness of the impugned judgment. Non-application or erroneous application of a legal rule shall constitute unlawfulness.” Article 308 “Unlawfulness is deemed to be manifest in the following cases: 1-where the court is not established in accordance with the law; 2-where one of the judges who have taken the decision was barred by statute from participating; ...” 20.The Government supplied copies of several decisions given by the prosecutor attached to the Istanbul National Security Court withdrawing charges against persons suspected of inciting people to hatred or hostility, especially on religious grounds (Article 312 of the Criminal Code), or of disseminating separatist propaganda against the indivisible unity of the State (section8 of Law no. 3713 – see paragraph 17 above). In the majority of cases where offences had been committed by means of publications the reasons given for the prosecutor’s decision included such considerations as the fact that the proceedings were time-barred, that some of the constituent elements of the offence could not be made out or that there was insufficient evidence. Other grounds included the fact that the publications in issue had not been distributed, that there had been no unlawful intent, that no offence had been committed or that those responsible could not be identified. Furthermore, the Government submitted a number of decisions of the National Security Courts as examples of cases in which defendants accused of the above-mentioned offences had been found not guilty. These were the judgments of 19 November (no. 1996/428) and 27 December 1996 (no.1996/519); 6 March (no. 1997/33), 3 June (no. 1997/102), 17October (no.1997/527), 24 October (no. 1997/541) and 23 December 1997 (no.1997/606); 21 January (no. 1998/8), 3 February (no. 1998/14), 19 March (no. 1998/56), 21 April 1998 (no. 1998/ 87) and 17June 1998 (no. 1998/133). As regards more particularly proceedings against authors of works dealing with the Kurdish problem, the National Security Courts in these cases reached their decisions on the ground that there had been no dissemination of “propaganda”, one of the constituent elements of the offence, or on account of the objective nature of the words used. 21.The National Security Courts were created by Law no. 1773 of 11 July 1973, in accordance with Article 136 of the 1961 Constitution. That law was annulled by the Constitutional Court on 15 June 1976. The courts in question were later reintroduced into the Turkish judicial system by the 1982 Constitution. The relevant part of the statement of reasons contains the following passage: “There may be acts affecting the existence and stability of a State such that when they are committed special jurisdiction is required in order to give judgment expeditiously and appropriately. For such cases it is necessary to set up National Security Courts. According to a principle inherent in our Constitution, it is forbidden to create a special court to give judgment on a specific act after it has been committed. For that reason the National Security Courts have been provided for in our Constitution to try cases involving the above-mentioned offences. Given that the special provisions laying down their powers have been enacted in advance and that the courts have been created before the commission of any offence , they may not be described as courts set up to deal with this or that offence after the commission of such an offence.” The composition and functioning of the National Security Courts are subject to the following rules. 22.The constitutional provisions governing judicial organisation are worded as follows: Article 138 §§ 1 and 2 “In the performance of their duties, judges shall be independent; they shall give judgment, according to their personal conviction, in accordance with the Constitution, statute and the law. No organ, authority, ... or ... person may give orders or instructions to courts or judges in the exercise of their judicial powers, or send them circulars or make recommendations or suggestions to them.” Article 139 § 1 “Judges shall not be removed from office or compelled to retire without their consent before the age prescribed by the Constitution” Article 143 §§ 1-5 “National Security Courts shall be established to try offences against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the territorial integrity of the State or the indivisible unity of the nation or against the free democratic system of government, and offences which directly affect the State’s internal or external security. National Security Courts shall be composed of a president, two other regular members, two substitute members, a prosecutor and a sufficient number of assistant prosecutors. The president, one of the regular members, one of the substitutes and the prosecutor, shall be appointed from among judges and public prosecutors of the first rank, according to procedures laid down in special legislation; one regular member and one substitute shall be appointed from among military judges of the first rank and the assistant prosecutors from among public prosecutors and military judges. Presidents, regular members and substitute members ... of National Security Courts shall be appointed for a renewable period of four years. Appeal against decisions of National Security Courts shall lie to the Court of Cassation. ...” Article 145 § 4 “Military legal proceedings The personal rights and obligations of military judges ... shall be regulated by law in accordance with the principles of the independence of the courts, the safeguards enjoyed by the judiciary and the requirements of military service. Relations between military judges and the commanders under whom they serve in the performance of their non-judicial duties shall also be regulated by law...” 23.Based on Article 143 of the Constitution, the relevant provisions of Law no. 2845 on the National Security Courts, provide: Section 1 “In the capitals of the provinces of ... National Security Courts shall be established to try persons accused of offences against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the territorial integrity of the State or the indivisible unity of the nation or against the free, democratic system of government and offences directly affecting the State’s internal or external security.” Section 3 “The National Security Courts shall be composed of a president, two other regular members and two substitute members.” Section 5 “The president of a National Security Court, one of the [two] regular members and one of the [two] substitutes ... shall be civilian ... judges, the other members, whether regular or substitute, military judges of the first rank...” Section 6 §§ 2, 3 and 6 “The appointment of military judges to sit as regular members and substitutes shall be carried out according to the procedure laid down for that purpose in the Military Legal Service Act. Except as provided in the present Law or other legislation, the president and the regular or substitute members of the National Security Courts ... may not be appointed to another post or place, without their consent, within four years... ... If, after an investigation concerning the president or a regular or substitute member of a National Security Court conducted according to the legislation concerning them, competent committees or authorities decide to change the duty station of the person concerned, the duty station of that judge or the duties themselves ... may be changed in accordance with the procedure laid down in that legislation.” Section 9 § 1 “National Security Courts shall have jurisdiction to try persons charged with ... (d)offences having a connection with the events which made it necessary to declare a state of emergency, in regions where a state of emergency has been declared in accordance with Article 120 of the Constitution, (e)offences committed against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the indivisible unity of the State – meaning both the national territory and its people – or against the free, democratic system of government and offences directly affecting the State’s internal or external security. ...” Section 27 § 1 “The Court of Cassation shall hear appeals against the judgments of the National Security Courts.” Section 34 §§ 1 and 2 “The rules governing the rights and obligations of ... military judges appointed to the National Security Courts and their supervision ..., the institution of disciplinary proceedings against them, the imposition of disciplinary penalties on them and the investigation and prosecution of any offences they may commit in the performance of their duties ... shall be as laid down in the relevant provisions of the laws governing their profession... The observations of the Court of Cassation on military judges, the assessment reports on them drawn up by Ministry of Justice assessors ... and the files on any investigations conducted in respect of them ... shall be transmitted to the Ministry of Justice.” Section 38 “A National Security Court may be transformed into a Martial Law Court, under the conditions set forth below, when a state of emergency has been declared in all or part of the territory in respect of which the National Security Court concerned has jurisdiction, provided that within that territory there is more than one National Security Court” 24.The relevant provisions of the Military Legal Service Act are worded as follows: Additional section 7 “The aptitude of military judges ... appointed as regular or substitute members of the National Security Courts that is required for promotion or advancement in salary step, rank or seniority shall be determined on the basis of assessment reports drawn up according to the procedure laid down below, subject to the provisions of the present Law and the Turkish Armed Forces Personnel Act (Law no. 926). (a)The first superior competent to carry out assessment and draw up assessment reports for military judges, whether regular or substitute members ... shall be the Minister of State in the Ministry of Defence, followed by the Minister of Defence. ...” Additional section 8 “Members ... of the National Security Courts belonging to the Military Legal Service ... shall be appointed by a committee composed of the personnel director and the legal adviser of the General Staff, the personnel director and the legal adviser attached to the staff of the arm in which the person concerned is serving and the Director of Military Judicial Affairs at the Ministry of Defence...” Section 16(1) and (3) “Military judges ... shall be appointed by a decree issued jointly by the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister and submitted to the President of the Republic for approval, in accordance with the provisions on the appointment and transfer of members of the armed forces... ... The procedure for appointment as a military judge shall take into account the opinion of the Court of Cassation, the reports by Ministry of Justice assessors and the assessment reports drawn up by the superiors...” Section 18(1) “The rules governing the salary scales, salary increases and various personal rights of military judges ... shall be as laid down in the provisions relating to officers.” Section 29 “The Minister of Defence may apply to military judges, after considering their defence submissions, the following disciplinary sanctions: A.A warning, which consists in giving the person concerned notice in writing that he must exercise more care in the performance of his duties. ... B.A reprimand, which consists in giving the person concerned notice in writing that a particular act or a particular attitude has been found to be blameworthy. ... The said sanctions shall be final, mentioned in the assessment record of the person concerned and entered in his personal file...” Section 38 “When military judges ... sit in court they shall wear the special dress of their civilian counterparts...” 25.Article 112 of the Military Criminal Code of 22 May 1930 provides: “It shall be an offence, punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment, to abuse one’s authority as a civil servant in order to influence the military courts.” 26.Under section 22 of Law no. 1602 the First Division of the Supreme Military Administrative Court has jurisdiction to hear applications for judicial review and claims for damages based on disputes relating to the personal status of officers, particularly those concerning their professional advancement.",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1.
III.	ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 10
60.  THE APPLICANT SUBMITTED THAT HE HAD BEEN PROSECUTED ON ACCOUNT OF HIS WRITINGS MERELY BECAUSE THEY WERE THE WORK OF A PERSON OF KURDISH ORIGIN AND CONCERNED THE KURDISH QUESTION. HE ARGUED THAT ON THAT ACCOUNT HE WAS A VICTIM OF DISCRIMINATION CONTRARY TO ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 10. ARTICLE 14 PROVIDES:
“THE ENJOYMENT OF THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS SET FORTH IN THE CONVENTION SHALL BE SECURED WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION ON ANY GROUND SUCH AS SEX, RACE, COLOUR, LANGUAGE, RELIGION, POLITICAL OR OTHER OPINION, NATIONAL OR SOCIAL ORIGIN, ASSOCIATION WITH A NATIONAL MINORITY, PROPERTY, BIRTH OR OTHER STATUS.”
61.  THE GOVERNMENT SUBMITTED THAT THE JUDGMENT DELIVERED WHEN THE APPLICANT WAS CONVICTED SHOWED THAT MR OKÇUOĞLU HAD BEEN PROSECUTED NOT BECAUSE HE BELONGED TO A PARTICULAR ETHNIC GROUP, BUT BECAUSE HE HAD DISSEMINATED SEPARATIST PROPAGANDA THAT JEOPARDISED THE FUNDAMENTAL INTEREST OF THE NATIONAL COLLECTIVITY.
62.  THE COMMISSION EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT NO SEPARATE ISSUE AROSE UNDER ARTICLE 14 READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 10.
63.  HAVING REGARD TO ITS CONCLUSION THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 TAKEN SEPARATELY (SEE PARAGRAPH 50 ABOVE), THE COURT DOES NOT CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE 14.
IV.	APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION
64.  THE APPLICANT SOUGHT JUST SATISFACTION UNDER ARTICLE 41, WHICH PROVIDES:
“IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION OR THE PROTOCOLS THERETO, AND IF THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTY CONCERNED ALLOWS ONLY PARTIAL REPARATION TO BE MADE, THE COURT SHALL, IF NECESSARY, AFFORD JUST SATISFACTION TO THE INJURED PARTY.”
A.	DAMAGE
65.  THE APPLICANT SOUGHT REPARATION FOR THE DAMAGE HE HAD SUSTAINED BUT LEFT THE AMOUNT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT.
66.  THE GOVERNMENT EXPRESSED NO OPINION.
67.  THE COURT NOTES THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE BEFORE IT OF ANY PECUNIARY DAMAGE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE APPLICANT SUFFERED DISTRESS ON ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS OF THE CAUSE. RULING ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS, IT CONSEQUENTLY AWARDS HIM FRF 40,000 FOR NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE.
B.	COSTS AND EXPENSES
68.  THE APPLICANT ALSO LEFT THE ISSUE OF COSTS AND EXPENSES TO THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT. HE DID HOWEVER STATE THAT HE WAS CONTRACTUALLY BOUND TO PAY HIS LAWYER 25,000 US DOLLARS IN FEES.
69.  THE GOVERNMENT EXPRESSED DOUBTS AS TO THE TRUTH OF THAT STATEMENT.
70.  ON THE BASIS OF THE INFORMATION IN ITS POSSESSION, THE COURT CONSIDERS IT REASONABLE TO AWARD THE APPLICANT FRF 20,000 BY WAY OF REIMBURSEMENT OF HIS COSTS AND EXPENSES.
C.	DEFAULT INTEREST
71.  THE COURT DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE TO ADOPT THE STATUTORY RATE OF INTEREST APPLICABLE IN FRANCE AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF THE PRESENT JUDGMENT WHICH ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO IT, IS 3.47% PER ANNUM.
FOR THESE REASONS THE COURT
1.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT THERE HAS BEEN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION;
2.	HOLDS BY 16 VOTES TO 1 THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION;
3.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT NO SEPARATE ISSUE ARISES UNDER ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 14;
4.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT
(A)  THE RESPONDENT STATE IS TO PAY THE APPLICANT, WITHIN THREE MONTHS, THE FOLLOWING SUMS, TO BE CONVERTED INTO TURKISH LIRAS AT THE RATE APPLICABLE ON THE DATE OF SETTLEMENT:
(B)  SIMPLE INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 3.47% SHALL BE PAYABLE ON THESE SUMS FROM THE EXPIRY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED THREE MONTHS UNTIL SETTLEMENT;
5.	DISMISSES UNANIMOUSLY THE REMAINDER OF THE APPLICANT’S CLAIMS FOR JUST SATISFACTION.
"
173,001-58272,Grand Chamber,"9.Mr Haluk Gerger is a Turkish national and was born in 1950. He lives in Ankara and works as a journalist. 10.On 23 May 1993 a memorial ceremony was held in Ankara for Denis Gezmiş and two of his friends, Yusuf Aslan and Hüseyin İnan. Together, they had started an extreme left-wing movement among university students at the end of the 1960s. They were sentenced to death for seeking to destroy the constitutional order by violence and executed in May 1972. The applicant was invited to speak at the ceremony, but was unable to attend and sent the organising committee the following message to be read out in public: “Dear friends, Though ill health has prevented me from being with you, I did not want to miss this opportunity to salute you and to express my solidarity with the revolutionary cause. The Turkish Republic is based on negation of the rights of workers and Kurds. Within the geographical boundaries of this country, any hint of human action, any aspiration for freedom, any claim to assert the rights of the workers and the Kurds has always met with a reaction on the part of the rulers that has been ruthless in its denial and destruction. It has to be said that, because of their origins and historic traditions, the rulers have always distinguished themselves through a cruel militarism that is the product of their mediocrity, backwardness, and thirst for ever more money and, lastly, of the fundamental nature of the Republic and its subservience to imperialism. The more the structural crisis of the established order deepened, the more the ruling classes resorted to imperialism and militarism in their desire to bring it to an end. The rulers, who had condemned the political and social lands of the country to sterile aridity and, in order to break any resistance and stifle any revolt by the masses, had put a chain of dependence around society’s neck and imposed oppressive uniformity upon it, succeeded for many long years in keeping our people in the deep gloom of silence. However, the 1960s revival, the action organised by dynamic social strata previously excluded from the political life of the country such as the workers, the intelligentsia and young people and, lastly, the revolutionary democratic resistance movement of the early 1970s have helped to transform the history of the nation, and their profound influence can still be felt today. A red hope is nascent in the tired barren hearts of the workers. A legend is born in the long history of defeat of the oppressed. From now on, nothing and no-one will be the same! In the face of the longstanding crisis of the established order, the quest for independence and freedom which at that time became ingrained in society’s conscience, in the collective memory of the toiling masses, in the memory of the young and the intelligentsia and in the conscience of the workers henceforth constitutes a refuge for society. The spirit of resistance and revolt of those heroic years, a nightmare for the rulers, has been with the country for more than twenty years. The socialist flag, which was borne aloft at the time and is representative of the only system capable of replacing the incumbent capitalist system, is still flying. From the seeds of liberation of the Kurdish people sown in those days the guerrilla campaign in the mountains of Kurdistan was born. As for us, the rivers, streams, torrents and waterfalls that emerged from the sweeping waters of those years, we are now flowing on toward the final release of mankind, across the plains formed by our class, our people and democracy into the ocean of liberty of a classless society. Like many Denizes [a reference to Deniz Gezmiş, whose first name means “the sea” in Turkish], we head towards the seas of freedom. Today, before the Ocean of Liberation, on these fertile alluvia formed of our solidarity and unity in the struggle, we hail those who have been invited to the heavenly feast. Hail, friends! Hail to those who are marching ‘Towards Future Times, Like many Denizes’! Hail to you, the rose Deniz, the rose Yusuf, the rose Hüseyin... the three roses of Karşıkaya planted on the branch of my heart the three roses of Karşıkaya planted in the spring of my tears with all their flowers of blood.” 11.On 6 August 1993 the Public Prosecutor at the Ankara National Security Court (“National Security Court”) accused the applicant of disseminating propaganda against the unity of the Turkish nation and the territorial integrity of the State. In order to request the application of section8(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713 – see paragraph 19 above), he relied on passages from Mr Gerger’s message, which had been recorded when read out at the memorial ceremony (these are the passages that appear in italics in paragraph 10 above). 12.Mr Gerger pleaded not guilty before the National Security Court, which sat as a chamber of three judges, including a military judge. He did not dispute having drafted the message, but maintained that he had never intended to promote separatism. 13.On 9 December 1993 the National Security Court found the applicant guilty of the offence under section 8(1) of Law no. 3713 and sentenced him to one year, eight months’ imprisonment and a fine of 208,333,333 Turkish liras (TRL). The judgment was delivered by a majority of two to one, the military judge dissenting. The latter explained in his dissenting opinion that, in his view, the offence of disseminating separatist propaganda under section 8(1) of Law no.3713 had not been made out, but that there had been non-public incitement to commit a crime and, consequently, Article 312 § 2 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 18 below) should have been applied. The other two members of the chamber found that passages such as: “... From the seeds of liberation of the Kurdish people sown in those days the guerrilla in the mountains of Kurdistan was born... As for us, the rivers, streams, torrents and waterfalls that emerged from the sweeping waters of those years, we are now flowing on ... across the plains formed by our class, our people and democracy...” (see paragraph 10 above), amounted to separatist propaganda against the unity of the Turkish nation and the territorial integrity of the State. In their view, the applicant’s conviction was justified by the message – whose wording was not in issue – taken as a whole. 14.In a judgment of 22 April 1994, the Court of Cassation dismissed an appeal by the applicant. 15.On 23 September 1995 the applicant completed his prison sentence. However, as he had not paid the fine that had been imposed, he was kept in detention pursuant to section 5 of the Execution of Sentences Act (Law no.647), being required to serve an additional day’s imprisonment for every TRL 10,000 due (see paragraph 21 below). On 26 October 1995 Mr Gerger paid the balance of the fine and was released. 16.On 30 October 1995 Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995 came into force. Inter alia, it reduced the length of prison sentences that could be imposed under section 8 of Law no. 3713 while increasing the level of fines (see paragraph 19 below). In a transitional provision relating to section 2, Lawno. 4126 provided that sentences imposed pursuant to section 8 of Law no.3713 would be automatically reviewed (see paragraph 20 below). 17.Consequently, the National Security Court reviewed the applicant’s case on the merits. On 17 November 1995 it imposed an additional fine of TRL 84,833,333, with payment suspended. That decision became final on 15 March 1996. 18.Article 312 of the Criminal Code reads as follows: “Non-public incitement to commit an offence A person who expressly praises or condones an act punishable by law as an offence or incites the population to break the law shall, on conviction, be liable to between six months’ and two years’ imprisonment and a ... fine of from six thousand to thirty thousand Turkish liras. A person who incites the people to hatred or hostility on the basis of a distinction between social classes, races, religions, denominations or regions shall, on conviction, be liable to between one and three years’ imprisonment and a fine of from nine thousand to thirty-six thousand liras. If this incitement endangers public safety, the sentence shall be increased by one third to one half. The penalties to be imposed on those who have committed the offences defined in the previous paragraph shall be doubled when they have done so by the means listed in Article 311 § 2.” 19.The Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713 of 12 April 1991), has been amended by Law no 4126 of 27 October 1995, which came into force on 30 October 1995. Sections 8 and 13 read as follows: Former section 8 § 1 “Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited, irrespective of the methods used and the intention. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than two and not more than five years’ imprisonment and a fine of from fifty million to one hundred million Turkish liras.” New section 8 § 1 “Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than one and not more than three years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras. The penalty imposed on a reoffender may not be commuted to a fine.” Section 17 ""“Persons convicted of the offences contemplated in the present law who ... have been punished with a custodial sentence shall be granted automatic parole when they have served three-quarters of their sentence, provided they have been of good conduct. … The first and second paragraphs of section 19 … of the Execution of Sentence Act (Law no. 647) shall not apply to the convicted persons mentioned above.” 20.The Law of 27 October 1995 contains a “transitional provision relating to section 2” that applies to the amendments which that law makes to the sentencing provisions of section 8 of Law no. 3713. That transitional provision provides: “In the month following the entry into force of the present Law, the court which has given judgment shall re-examine the case of a person convicted pursuant to section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) and, in accordance with the amendment ... to section 8 of Law no. 3713, shall reconsider the term of imprisonment imposed on that person and decide whether he should be allowed the benefit of sections 4 and 6 of Law no. 647 of 13 July 1965.” 21.Law no. 647 prescribes rules through, inter alia, the following provisions, regarding the collection of fines and automatic parole. Section 5 “The term ‘fine’ shall mean payment to the Treasury of a sum fixed within the statutory limits... If, after service of the order to pay, the convicted person does not pay the fine within the time-limit, he shall be committed to prison for a term of one day for every ten thousand Turkish liras owed, by a decision of the public prosecutor... The sentence of imprisonment thus substituted for the fine may not exceed three years…” Section 19(1) “… persons who ... have been ordered to serve a custodial sentence shall be granted automatic parole when they have served half of their sentence, provided they have been of good conduct...” 22.The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure concerning the grounds on which defendants may appeal on points of law against judgments of courts of first instance read as follows: Article 307 “An appeal on points of law may not concern any issue other than the lawfulness of the impugned judgment. Non-application or erroneous application of a legal rule shall constitute unlawfulness.” Article 308 “Unlawfulness is deemed to be manifest in the following cases: 1-where the court is not established in accordance with the law; 2-where one of the judges who have taken the decision was barred by statute from participating; ...” 23.The Government supplied copies of several decisions given by the prosecutor attached to the Istanbul National Security Court withdrawing charges against persons suspected of inciting people to hatred or hostility, especially on religious grounds (Article 312 of the Criminal Code – see paragraph 18 above), or of disseminating separatist propaganda against the indivisible unity of the State (section8 of Law no. 3713 – see paragraph 19 above). In the majority of cases where offences had been committed by means of publications the reasons given for the prosecutor’s decision included such considerations as the fact that the proceedings were time-barred, that some of the constituent elements of the offence could not be made out or that there was insufficient evidence. Furthermore, the Government submitted a number of decisions of the National Security Courts as examples of cases in which defendants accused of the above-mentioned offences had been found not guilty. These were the judgments of 19 November (no. 1996/428) and 27 December 1996 (no. 1996/519); 6 March (no. 1997/33), 3 June (no. 1997/102), 17October (no. 1997/527), 24 October (no. 1997/541) and 23 December 1997 (no. 1997/606); 21 January (no. 1998/8), 3 February (no. 1998/14), 19 March (no. 1998/56), 21 April 1998 (no. 1998/ 87) and 17June 1998 (no. 1998/133). As regards more particularly proceedings against authors of works dealing with the Kurdish problem, the National Security Courts in these cases reached their decisions on the ground that there had been no dissemination of “propaganda”, one of the constituent elements of the offence. 24.The National Security Courts were created by Law no. 1773 of 11 July 1973, in accordance with Article 136 of the 1961 Constitution. That law was annulled by the Constitutional Court on 15 June 1976. The courts in question were later reintroduced into the Turkish judicial system by the 1982 Constitution. The relevant part of the statement of reasons contains the following passage: “There may be acts affecting the existence and stability of a State such that when they are committed special jurisdiction is required in order to give judgment expeditiously and appropriately. For such cases it is necessary to set up National Security Courts. According to a principle inherent in our Constitution, it is forbidden to create a special court to give judgment on a specific act after it has been committed. For that reason the National Security Courts have been provided for in our Constitution to try cases involving the above-mentioned offences. Given that the special provisions laying down their powers have been enacted in advance and that the courts have been created before the commission of any offence , they may not be described as courts set up to deal with this or that offence after the commission of such an offence.” The composition and functioning of the National Security Courts are subject to the following rules. 25.The constitutional provisions governing judicial organisation are worded as follows: Article 138 §§ 1 and 2 “In the performance of their duties, judges shall be independent; they shall give judgment, according to their personal conviction, in accordance with the Constitution, statute and the law. No organ, authority, ... or ... person may give orders or instructions to courts or judges in the exercise of their judicial powers, or send them circulars or make recommendations or suggestions to them.” Article 139 § 1 “Judges shall not be removed from office or compelled to retire without their consent before the age prescribed by the Constitution” Article 143 §§ 1-5 “National Security Courts shall be established to try offences against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the territorial integrity of the State or the indivisible unity of the nation or against the free democratic system of government, and offences which directly affect the State’s internal or external security. National Security Courts shall be composed of a president, two other regular members, two substitute members, a prosecutor and a sufficient number of assistant prosecutors. The president, one of the regular members, one of the substitutes and the prosecutor, shall be appointed from among judges and public prosecutors of the first rank, according to procedures laid down in special legislation; one regular member and one substitute shall be appointed from among military judges of the first rank and the assistant prosecutors from among public prosecutors and military judges. Presidents, regular members and substitute members ... of National Security Courts shall be appointed for a renewable period of four years. Appeal against decisions of National Security Courts shall lie to the Court of Cassation. ...” Article 145 § 4 “Military legal proceedings The personal rights and obligations of military judges … shall be regulated by law in accordance with the principles of the independence of the courts, the safeguards enjoyed by the judiciary and the requirements of military service. Relations between military judges and the commanders under whom they serve in the performance of their non-judicial duties shall also be regulated by law...” 26.Based on Article 143 of the Constitution, the relevant provisions of Law no. 2845 on the National Security Courts, provide: Section 1 “In the capitals of the provinces of … National Security Courts shall be established to try persons accused of offences against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the territorial integrity of the State or the indivisible unity of the nation or against the free, democratic system of government and offences directly affecting the State’s internal or external security.” Section 3 “The National Security Courts shall be composed of a president, two other regular members and two substitute members.” Section 5 “The president of a National Security Court, one of the [two] regular members and one of the [two] substitutes ... shall be civilian … judges, the other members, whether regular or substitute, military judges of the first rank…” Section 6 §§ 2, 3 and 6 “The appointment of military judges to sit as regular members and substitutes shall be carried out according to the procedure laid down for that purpose in the Military Legal Service Act. Except as provided in the present Law or other legislation, the president and the regular or substitute members of the National Security Courts … may not be appointed to another post or place, without their consent, within four years… … If, after an investigation concerning the president or a regular or substitute member of a National Security Court conducted according to the legislation concerning them, competent committees or authorities decide to change the duty station of the person concerned, the duty station of that judge or the duties themselves … may be changed in accordance with the procedure laid down in that legislation.” Section 9 § 1 “National Security Courts shall have jurisdiction to try persons charged with … (d)offences having a connection with the events which made it necessary to declare a state of emergency, in regions where a state of emergency has been declared in accordance with Article 120 of the Constitution, (e)offences committed against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the indivisible unity of the State – meaning both the national territory and its people – or against the free, democratic system of government and offences directly affecting the State’s internal or external security. …” Section 27 § 1 “The Court of Cassation shall hear appeals against the judgments of the National Security Courts.” Section 34 §§ 1 and 2 “The rules governing the rights and obligations of … military judges appointed to the National Security Courts and their supervision …, the institution of disciplinary proceedings against them, the imposition of disciplinary penalties on them and the investigation and prosecution of any offences they may commit in the performance of their duties ... shall be as laid down in the relevant provisions of the laws governing their profession… The observations of the Court of Cassation on military judges, the assessment reports on them drawn up by Ministry of Justice assessors … and the files on any investigations conducted in respect of them … shall be transmitted to the Ministry of Justice.” Section 38 “A National Security Court may be transformed into a Martial Law Court, under the conditions set forth below, when a state of emergency has been declared in all or part of the territory in respect of which the National Security Court concerned has jurisdiction, provided that within that territory there is more than one National Security Court” 27.The relevant provisions of the Military Legal Service Act are worded as follows: Additional section 7 “The aptitude of military judges … appointed as regular or substitute members of the National Security Courts that is required for promotion or advancement in salary step, rank or seniority shall be determined on the basis of assessment reports drawn up according to the procedure laid down below, subject to the provisions of the present Law and the Turkish Armed Forces Personnel Act (Law no. 926). (a)The first superior competent to carry out assessment and draw up assessment reports for military judges, whether regular or substitute members … shall be the Minister of State in the Ministry of Defence, followed by the Minister of Defence. …” Additional section 8 “Members … of the National Security Courts belonging to the Military Legal Service … shall be appointed by a committee composed of the personnel director and the legal adviser of the General Staff, the personnel director and the legal adviser attached to the staff of the arm in which the person concerned is serving and the Director of Military Judicial Affairs at the Ministry of Defence…” Section 16(1) and (3) “Military judges … shall be appointed by a decree issued jointly by the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister and submitted to the President of the Republic for approval, in accordance with the provisions on the appointment and transfer of members of the armed forces… … The procedure for appointment as a military judge shall take into account the opinion of the Court of Cassation, the reports by Ministry of Justice assessors and the assessment reports drawn up by the superiors…” Section 18(1) “The rules governing the salary scales, salary increases and various personal rights of military judges … shall be as laid down in the provisions relating to officers.” Section 29 “The Minister of Defence may apply to military judges, after considering their defence submissions, the following disciplinary sanctions: A.A warning, which consists in giving the person concerned notice in writing that he must exercise more care in the performance of his duties. … B.A reprimand, which consists in giving the person concerned notice in writing that a particular act or a particular attitude has been found to be blameworthy. … The said sanctions shall be final, mentioned in the assessment record of the person concerned and entered in his personal file…” Section 38 “When military judges … sit in court they shall wear the special dress of their civilian counterparts…” 28.Article 112 of the Military Criminal Code of 22 May 1930 provides: “It shall be an offence, punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment, to abuse one’s authority as a civil servant in order to influence the military courts.” 29.Under section 22 of Law no. 1602 the First Division of the Supreme Military Administrative Court has jurisdiction to hear applications for judicial review and claims for damages based on disputes relating to the personal status of officers, particularly those concerning their professional advancement.",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1.
B.	ALLEGED ABSENCE OF REASONING IN THE JUDGMENT OF THE ANKARA NATIONAL SECURITY COURT
63.  THE APPLICANT MAINTAINED THAT THE ANKARA NATIONAL SECURITY COURT HAD NOT GIVEN SUFFICIENT REASONS FOR ITS DECISION, AND HAD THEREBY INFRINGED HIS RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL.
64.  THE GOVERNMENT ARGUED THAT THAT COMPLAINT WAS UNFOUNDED.
65.  LIKE THE COMMISSION, THE COURT HOLDS THAT IN VIEW OF ITS FINDING OF A VIOLATION OF MR GERGER’S RIGHT TO BE TRIED BY AN INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL TRIBUNAL (SEE PARAGRAPH 62 ABOVE), IT IS UNNECESSARY TO EXAMINE THIS COMPLAINT.
III.	ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 5 § 1
66.  THE APPLICANT SAID THAT THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN SENTENCED TO A TERM OF IMPRISONMENT UNDER LAW NO. 3713 MEANT THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ENTITLED TO AUTOMATIC PAROLE UNTIL HE HAD SERVED THREE QUARTERS OF HIS SENTENCE, UNLIKE PRISONERS SENTENCED UNDER THE ORDINARY CRIMINAL LAW, WHO WERE ENTITLED TO PAROLE AFTER SERVING HALF THEIR SENTENCE. HE CONSIDERED THAT THAT DIFFERENCE CONSTITUTED UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION UNDER ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION, WHICH PROVIDES:
“THE ENJOYMENT OF THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS SET FORTH IN THIS CONVENTION SHALL BE SECURED WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION ON ANY GROUND SUCH AS SEX, RACE, COLOUR, LANGUAGE, RELIGION, POLITICAL OR OTHER OPINION, NATIONAL OR SOCIAL ORIGIN, ASSOCIATION WITH A NATIONAL MINORITY, PROPERTY, BIRTH OR OTHER STATUS.”
67.  THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THIS QUESTION RELATES TO “THE LAWFUL DETENTION OF A PERSON AFTER CONVICTION BY A COMPETENT COURT” AND SHOULD THEREFORE BE EXAMINED UNDER ARTICLE 14 TAKEN TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 5 § 1 (A) OF THE CONVENTION. THE LATTER PROVISION PROVIDES:
“1.  EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND SECURITY OF PERSON. NO ONE SHALL BE DEPRIVED OF HIS LIBERTY SAVE IN THE FOLLOWING CASES AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH A PROCEDURE PRESCRIBED BY LAW:
(A)  THE LAWFUL DETENTION OF A PERSON AFTER CONVICTION BY A COMPETENT COURT;”
68.  THE GOVERNMENT SUBMITTED THAT ARTICLE 5 § 1 (A) DID NOT SECURE CONVICTED PRISONERS A RIGHT TO AUTOMATIC PAROLE. THEY ADDED THAT IN ANY EVENT THE RESTRICTIONS ON ENTITLEMENT TO PAROLE IMPOSED ON PERSONS CONVICTED OF AN OFFENCE UNDER THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT WERE WARRANTED BY THE INTRINSIC SERIOUSNESS OF SUCH OFFENCES.
69.  THE COURT CONSIDERS, FIRSTLY, THAT, ALTHOUGH ARTICLE 5 § 1 (A) OF THE CONVENTION DOES NOT GUARANTEE A RIGHT TO AUTOMATIC PAROLE, AN ISSUE MAY ARISE UNDER THAT PROVISION TAKEN TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION IF A SETTLED SENTENCING POLICY AFFECTS INDIVIDUALS IN A DISCRIMINATORY MANNER.
THE COURT NOTES THAT IN PRINCIPLE THE AIM OF LAW NO. 3713 IS TO PENALISE PEOPLE WHO COMMIT TERRORIST OFFENCES AND THAT ANYONE CONVICTED UNDER THAT LAW WILL BE TREATED LESS FAVOURABLY WITH REGARD TO AUTOMATIC PAROLE THAN PERSONS CONVICTED UNDER THE ORDINARY LAW. IT DEDUCES FROM THAT FACT THAT THE DISTINCTION IS MADE NOT BETWEEN DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE, BUT BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF OFFENCE, ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATURE’S VIEW OF THEIR GRAVITY. THE COURT SEES NO GROUND FOR CONCLUDING THAT THAT PRACTICE AMOUNTS TO A FORM OF “DISCRIMINATION” THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE CONVENTION. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 TAKEN TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 5 § 1 (A) OF THE CONVENTION.
IV.	APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION
70.  THE APPLICANT SOUGHT JUST SATISFACTION UNDER ARTICLE 41, WHICH PROVIDES:
“IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION OR THE PROTOCOLS THERETO, AND IF THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTY CONCERNED ALLOWS ONLY PARTIAL REPARATION TO BE MADE, THE COURT SHALL, IF NECESSARY, AFFORD JUST SATISFACTION TO THE INJURED PARTY.”
A.	DAMAGE
71.  WITHOUT SUPPLYING ANY DETAILS, MR GERGER SOUGHT REPARATION FOR DAMAGE WHICH HE PUT AT 1,000,000 FRENCH FRANCS (FRF).
72.  THE GOVERNMENT REPLIED THAT THERE WAS NO CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN THE ALLEGED VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION AND ANY PECUNIARY DAMAGE. ANY NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE WOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY COMPENSATED FOR BY A FINDING OF A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION.
73.  THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THE APPLICANT MUST HAVE SUFFERED DISTRESS ON ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE. RULING ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS, IT CONSEQUENTLY AWARDS HIM FRF 40,000 FOR NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE.
THE COURT NOTES THAT IF IT WAS MR GERGER’S INTENTION TO CLAIM PECUNIARY DAMAGE ALSO, HE HAS NOT SUPPLIED ANY EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF SUCH A CLAIM; ACCORDINGLY, IT MAKES NO AWARD UNDER THAT HEAD.
B.	COSTS AND EXPENSES
74.  THE APPLICANT SOUGHT PAYMENT OF FRF 250,000 FOR HIS COSTS AND EXPENSES.
75.  THE GOVERNMENT SAID THE CLAIM WAS “EXORBITANT” AND ARGUED THAT THE APPLICANT HAD NOT PRODUCED ANY SUPPORTING EVIDENCE.
76.  ON THE BASIS OF THE INFORMATION IN ITS POSSESSION, THE COURT CONSIDERS IT REASONABLE TO AWARD THE APPLICANT FRF 20,000 BY WAY OF REIMBURSEMENT OF HIS COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURTS AND BEFORE THE COMMISSION AND THE COURT.
C.	DEFAULT INTEREST
77.  THE COURT DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE TO ADOPT THE STATUTORY RATE OF INTEREST APPLICABLE IN FRANCE AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF THE PRESENT JUDGMENT WHICH ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO IT, IS 3.47% PER ANNUM.
FOR THESE REASONS THE COURT
1.	HOLDS BY 16 VOTES TO 1 THAT THERE HAS BEEN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION;
2.	DISMISSES UNANIMOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT’S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS RELATING TO THE COMPLAINT THAT THE ANKARA NATIONAL SECURITY COURT WAS NOT “INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL” WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION;
3.	HOLDS BY 16 VOTES TO 1 THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION IN THAT THE ANKARA NATIONAL SECURITY COURT WAS NOT “INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL”;
4.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT IT IS UNNECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE APPLICANT’S OTHER COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION;
5.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 5 § 1;
6.	HOLDS BY 16 VOTES TO 1
(A)	THAT THE RESPONDENT GOVERNMENT IS TO PAY THE APPLICANT, WITHIN THREE MONTHS, THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS TO BE CONVERTED INTO TURKISH LIRAS AT THE RATE APPLICABLE AT THE DATE OF PAYMENT:
(B)	THAT SIMPLE INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 3.47% SHALL BE PAYABLE FROM THE EXPIRY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED THREE MONTHS UNTIL SETTLEMENT;
7.	DISMISSES UNANIMOUSLY THE REMAINDER OF THE APPLICANT’S’ CLAIMS FOR JUST SATISFACTION.
"
97,001-78623,Grand Chamber,"9.The ten applicants are all citizens of Serbia and Montenegro, which was known at the time of the events in question as the (“the FRY”). The first two applicants, Dusan and Zoran Markovic, were born in 1924 and 1952 respectively, and applied to the Court on behalf of Dejan Markovic, deceased son of Dusan Markovic and brother of Zoran Markovic. The third and fourth applicants, Dusika and Vladimir Jontic, were born in 1948 and 1978 respectively, and applied to the Court on behalf of Slobodan Jontic, deceased husband of Dusika Jontic and father of Vladimir Jontic. The fifth applicant, Draga Jankovic, was born in 1947 and applied to the Court on behalf of her deceased husband, Milovan Jankovic. The sixth and seventh applicants, Mirjana and Slavica Stevanovic, were born in 1945 and 1974 respectively, and applied to the Court on behalf of Slavisa Stevanovic, deceased son of Mirjana Stevanovic and brother of Slavica Stevanovic. The eighth, ninth and tenth applicants, Milena, Obrad and Dejan Dragojevic, were born in 1953, 1946 and 1975 respectively, and applied to the Court on behalf of Dragorad Dragojevic, deceased son of Milena and Obrad Dragojevic and brother of Dejan Dragojevic. 10.The applicants lodged the present application to complain of the outcome of an action in damages which they had brought in the Italian courts in respect of an air strike against the FRY. 11.The facts of the case relate to the same events as those considered by the Court in its decision in the case of Banković and Others v. Belgium and Others ((dec.) [GC], no. 52207/99, ECHR 2001-XII). The facts in that case were summarised as follows: “6.The conflict in Kosovo between Serbian and Kosovar Albanian forces during 1998 and 1999 is well documented. Against the background of the escalating conflict, together with the growing concerns and unsuccessful diplomatic initiatives of the international community, the six-nation Contact Group (established in 1992 by the London Conference) met and agreed to convene negotiations between the parties to the conflict.>On 30 January 1999, and following a decision of its North Atlantic Council (NAC), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) announced air strikes on the territory of the FRY in the case of non-compliance with the demands of the international community. Negotiations consequently took place between the parties to the conflict from 6 to 23 February 1999 in Rambouillet and from 15 to 18 March 1999 in . The resulting proposed peace agreement was signed by the Kosovar Albanian delegation but not by the Serbian delegation.>Considering that all efforts to achieve a negotiated political solution to the Kosovo crisis had failed, the NAC decided on, and on 23 March 1999 the Secretary General of NATO announced, the beginning of air strikes (Operation Allied Force) against the FRY. The air strikes lasted from 24 March to 8 June 1999. ...>Three television channels and four radio stations operated from the RTS facilities in . The main production facilities were housed in three buildings at . The master control room was housed on the first floor of one of the buildings and was staffed mainly by technical staff. 10.On 23 April 1999, just after 2 a.m. approximately, one of the RTS buildings at was hit by a missile launched from a NATO forces’ aircraft. Two of the four floors of the building collapsed and the master control room was destroyed. 11.... Twenty-four targets were hit in the FRY that night, including three in .” 12.The partial collapse of the RTS building caused the deaths of sixteen people, including the five relatives of the applicants. 13.On 31 May 2000 the first four applicants brought an action in damages in the Rome District Court under Article 2043 of the Italian Civil Code. The other six applicants applied to be joined to the proceedings on 3November 2000. 14.The applicants believed that civil liability for the deaths of their relatives lay with the Italian Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of Defence and with the Command of NATO’s Allied Forces in Southern Europe (AFSOUTH). They argued that the Italian courts had jurisdiction to hear the case. In particular, on the basis of the wording of Article 6 of the Italian Criminal Code, they submitted that the unlawful act that had caused the alleged damage should be regarded as having been committed in inasmuch as the military action had been organised on Italian territory and part of it had taken place there. They based this argument on the extent of ’s commitment – involving substantial political and logistical support – to the military mission in question. Specifically, Italy, unlike other NATO members, had provided the air bases from which the aircraft that had bombed and the RTS had taken off. They also relied in support of their claim on Article 174 of the Wartime Military Criminal Code and on the London Convention of 1951 and the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions. 15.The defendants argued that the Italian courts had no jurisdiction to hear the case. The proceedings against AFSOUTH were discontinued by the applicants. 16.The Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Defence subsequently sought a preliminary ruling from the Court of Cassation on the question of jurisdiction (regolamento preventivo di giurisdizione) under Article 41 of the Italian Code of Civil Procedure. 17.In written submissions dated 16 November 2001, Assistant Principal State Counsel at the Court of Cassation argued that the application for a preliminary ruling should be declared inadmissible as it concerned the merits of the claim, not the issue of jurisdiction. He stated as follows: “The governmental bodies defending this claim have requested a preliminary ruling on the issue of jurisdiction, arguing that: (a)since the action is brought against the Italian State as a specific (unitary) subject of international law for acts performed in the exercise of its imperium (iure imperii), it cannot be brought in the Italian courts; (b)paragraph 5 of Article VIII of the London Convention of 19 June 1951, which Italy ratified by Law no. 1335 of 1955, does not provide any basis for the action either, as it applies to damage caused in the receiving State. The government seek to show through this jurisdictional issue that the Italian legal system does not contain any provision or principle capable of providing a basis for the alleged personal right [diritto soggettivo perfetto] or of guaranteeing it in the abstract. Accordingly, the position is that: (a)the government argue that the cannot be held liable for acts carried out in the exercise of its imperium; (b)in addition, they deny that the said London Convention can be used to determine the place where the acts which caused the alleged damage took place (it is not by accident that the applicant has cited the provisions of the Criminal Code referring to the place where the offence was committed). It follows that the questions thus raised go to the merits, not to the issue of jurisdiction (see judgment no. 903 of 17 December 1999 of the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court). For these reasons, the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, is asked to declare the application inadmissible, with all the consequences which that entails in law.” 18.In a ruling (no. 8157) of 8 February 2002, which was deposited with the registry on 5 June 2002 and conveyed to the applicants on 11 June 2002, the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court (Sezioni Unite), found that the Italian courts had no jurisdiction. It reasoned as follows: “...>The claim seeks to impute liability to the on the basis of an act of war, in particular the conduct of hostilities through aerial warfare. The choice of the means that will be used to conduct hostilities is an act of government. These are acts through which political functions are performed and the Constitution provides for them to be assigned to a constitutional body. The nature of such functions precludes any claim to a protected interest in relation thereto, so that the acts by which they are carried out may or may not have a specific content – see the judgments of the full court of 12 July 1968 (no. 2452), 17 October 1980 (no. 5583) and 8 January 1993 (no.124). With respect to acts of this type, no court has the power to review the manner in which the function was performed.>While the purpose of the provisions of international agreements governing the conduct of hostilities – the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions (Articles35.2, 48, 49, 51, 52 and 57) and the European Convention on Human Rights (Articles 2 and 15 § 2) – is to protect civilians in the event of attack, they are rules of international law, and so also regulate relations between States. These same treaties lay down the procedure for finding a violation and the sanctions in the event of liability (Article 91 of the Protocol and Article 41 of the Convention); they also designate the international courts and tribunals with jurisdiction to make such a finding. However, the legislation implementing these rules in the does not contain any express provision enabling injured parties to seek reparation from the State for damage sustained as a result of a violation of the rules of international law. The notion that provisions to that effect may implicitly have been introduced into the system through the implementation of rules of international law is at odds with the converse principle that has been mentioned which holds that protected individual interests are no bar to carrying out functions of a political nature. Indeed, in order to enable reparation to be provided in the domestic system for loss sustained as a result of a violation of the ‘reasonable time’ requirement under Article 6 of the Convention on Human Rights, [the State] introduced appropriate legislation (Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001).>No entitlement to a review of the government’s decision concerning the conduct of hostilities with respect to the NATO aerial operations against the can be found in the London Convention of 1951. The fact that the aircraft used to bomb the Belgrade radio and television station were able to use bases situated on Italian territory constitutes but one element of the highly complex operation whose lawfulness it is sought to review and is not therefore relevant to the application of the rule laid down in paragraph 5 of Article VIII of the Convention, which on the contrary presupposes the commission of an act that is amenable to review.” 19.The Court of Cassation’s ruling brought to an end, ipso jure, the proceedings in the Rome District Court. 20.The relevant provisions of the Italian Constitution are as follows: Article 10 § 1 “The Italian legal system shall comply with the generally recognised rules of international law. ...” Article 24 § 1 “Everyone may bring legal proceedings to protect his or her rights and legitimate interests. ...” Article 28 “Civil servants, other agents of the State and public entities shall be directly responsible, in accordance with the criminal, civil and administrative law, for acts committed in breach of rights. In connection with such acts, civil liability shall extend to the State and public entities. ...” Article 113 “Judicial protection of rights and legitimate interests in the ordinary and administrative courts shall always lie against acts of the public administrative authorities. It may not be excluded or limited to extraordinary remedies or specific categories of act. The law shall specify which judicial bodies are empowered to set aside acts of the public authorities, in what cases and with what effects.” 21.Article 31 of Royal Decree no. 1024 of 26 June 1924 provides: “No appeal to the Consiglio di Stato, sitting in its judicial capacity, shall lie against acts or decisions of the government which involve the exercise of political power.” 22.Article 2043 of the Civil Code provides: “Any unlawful act which causes damage to another will render the perpetrator liable in damages under the civil law.” 23.Article 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which deals with the issue of jurisdiction, provides: “For so long as there has been no determination of the merits of the proceedings at first instance, any party may seek a ruling on a question of jurisdiction under Article37 from the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court. ...” Article 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: “A ruling that an ordinary court has no jurisdiction because the case concerns a public authority or is within the province of a special court may be made at any time and at any level of jurisdiction, including by the court of its own motion.” 24.The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code provide: Article 6 “Anyone who commits an offence on the territory of the State shall be punished in accordance with Italian law. The offence will be regarded as having been committed on the territory of the State if all or part of the act or omission at the origin of the offence or all or some of the consequences of such act or omission occurred there.” Article 185 “Restitution and compensation for damage. The commission of an offence shall give rise to an obligation of restitution under the civil law [Articles 2043 et seq. of the Civil Code]. Any offence that causes pecuniary damage [Article 2056 of the Civil Code] or non-pecuniary damage [Article 2059 of the Civil Code] shall impose an obligation on the perpetrator and those accountable for his or her actions under the civil law [Article2047 of the Civil Code] to make reparation.” “A commanding officer of a military force who, in order to inflict damage on the enemy, orders or authorises the use of a means or method of warfare that is prohibited by law or by international treaty or which is in any event contrary to the military code of honour shall be liable on conviction to a minimum of five years’ imprisonment unless the act concerned is a criminal offence under a specific statutory provision. If the act results in a massacre, the minimum term of imprisonment shall be ten years.” 26.In a judgment of 10 July 1992 (no. 124/1993), the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, established the rule that the courts had no jurisdiction to hear cases against the authorities relating to political acts. A trade union had brought an action against the Prime Minister, the Civil Service Ministry and the Ministry of State Education on the ground that the government had failed to comply with their undertakings. The Court of Cassation noted, inter alia, that such a failure could only engage the government’s political responsibility, but could not create a right. It ruled that the courts had no jurisdiction to hear the case after formulating the following principle: “Legislative action is a political act since it is the standard means of performing political and governmental functions. The governmental authority’s conduct in the present case was not, therefore, capable in law of causing individuals damage (whether to their personal rights or to their legitimate interests); it consequently escapes all judicial scrutiny.” 27.The Italian courts had in fact already examined this question in a number of earlier cases and had ruled that, as they were political in nature, the following acts escaped the scrutiny of the domestic courts: (i)a waiver of the right to exercise jurisdiction under Article VII of the Agreement of 1951 between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces (Court of Cassation, Third Criminal Division, 21 March 1962, no. 1645, Kinardi and Others, Giust. Pen. [Criminal Justice], 1963, III, p. 80); (ii)the assignment of property belonging to Italian nationals under the London Convention of 1951 (Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, 12July 1968, no. 2452, De Langlade v. the Treasury, Rivista diritto internazionale [International Law Review], 1969, p. 583); (iii)a Transport Ministry decree suspending permission to transport goods to (Rome District Court, 18 May 1993, Soc. S. and C. Transp. GmbH v. Ministry of Transport, Rivista diritto internazionale privato e processuale [Review of Private International Law and Procedure], 1995, p.755); (iv)a decision by the Ministry of Employment appointing employees’ representatives as delegates to the International Labour Organisation (Lazio Regional Administrative Court, 20 August 1976, no. 492, CISNAL v. Ministry of Employment and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Italian Yearbook of International Law, 1978-79, p. 184); (v)a declaration of war and treaty provisions relating to compensation for war damage ( (I), 28 January 1985, no. 106, Pestalozza v. the Treasury, Trib. Amm. Reg. [Regional Administrative Court Review], 1985, p. 381). 28.The full court of the Court of Cassation delivered a further judgment (no. 5044) on 11 March 2004. It concerned the jurisdiction of the Italian civil courts to hear claims for compensation for damage sustained by a person who had been captured by the German military in 1944 and deported to work for German industry. had pleaded State immunity and the courts of first instance and appeal had held that they had no jurisdiction to make an order against it. The Court of Cassation carried out a very extensive examination of the international treaties on international crime, imprescriptibility, the international responsibility of States, immunity from jurisdiction and of the case-law of various international tribunals. In holding that the immunity plea failed and the Italian courts had to decide the claim, it stated inter alia: “... In a decision no. 8157 of 5 June 2002, this full court did indeed rule that acts performed by the State in the conduct of hostilities escape all scrutiny by the courts, as they are acts through which ‘political’ functions are carried out. The nature of these functions ‘precludes any claim to a protected interest in respect thereto, so that there may or may not be a specific content to the acts through which they are performed’. Pursuant to this principle, the Italian courts were held to have no jurisdiction to hear a claim against the Italian Prime Minister’s Office and the Italian Ministry of Defence for compensation for the destruction of a non-military objective during NATO air strikes against the or for the resultant civilian deaths. It is readily apparent, however, firstly, that the fact that the court cannot contest the manner in which the actions of the supreme head of the res publica are conducted does not prevent it from finding that a criminal offence has been committed or that there is related liability under the criminal or civil law (Articles 90 and 96 of the Constitution; section 15 of Constitutional Law no. 1 of 1953; and section 30 of Law no. 20 of 1962); secondly, by virtue of the principle of adaptation established by Article 10 § 1 of the Constitution, the ‘generally recognised’ principles of international law which govern the fundamental values constituted by the freedom and dignity of the human being and characterise the most serious assaults upon the integrity of those values as ‘international crimes’ have ‘automatically’ been integrated into our system and are entirely apt for use as a standard whereby the injustice of damage caused to others by intentional or negligent ‘acts’ may be gauged. It is evident, therefore, that the principles referred to in this decision cannot be taken into consideration in the instant case. ...>1Granting immunity from jurisdiction to States who have been guilty of such wrongdoing is in manifest contradiction with the aforementioned normative rules because it constitutes an obstacle to the defence of values whose protection, like these norms and principles, must on the contrary be considered essential for the entire international community, even to the point of justifying forms of mandatory response in the most serious cases. Nor is there any doubt that the antinomy must be resolved by giving priority to the highest ranking norms, as the judges in the minority (eight to nine) stated in their dissenting opinion appended to the judgment in Al-Adsani [v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35763/97, ECHR 2001-XI], by precluding in such cases any claim by the State to immunity from suit in the foreign courts.” 29.In 1993 the Italian government decided to send a military expeditionary force to to perform peacekeeping operations. After the expeditionary force had returned to , it was discovered that some of its members had engaged in the torture of Somali prisoners. Two members of the expedition were charged and given prison sentences. They were also ordered to pay compensation to the civil party. In judgment no. 28154 of 7March 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 10 July 2002, the ordered another Italian serviceman and the Ministry of Defence to make reparation for the damage sustained by the relatives of a civilian whom the serviceman had killed unlawfully. 30.The applicants relied in the domestic courts on the Protocol Additional of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I). The Protocol, which ratified through Law no. 672 of 11December 1985, contains, inter alia, the following provisions: Article 35 – Basic rules “1.In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited.>It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.>It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment. ...” Article 48 – Basic rule “In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.” Article 49 – Definition of attacks and scope of application “1.’Attacks’ means acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defence.>The provisions of this Protocol with respect to attacks apply to all attacks in whatever territory conducted, including the national territory belonging to a Party to the conflict but under the control of an adverse Party.>The provisions of this section apply to any land, air or sea warfare which may affect the civilian population, individual civilians or civilian objects on land. They further apply to all attacks from the sea or from the air against objectives on land but do not otherwise affect the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict at sea or in the air.>The provisions of this section are additional to the rules concerning humanitarian protection contained in the Fourth Convention, particularly in Part II thereof, and in other international agreements binding upon the High Contracting Parties, as well as to other rules of international law relating to the protection of civilians and civilian objects on land, at sea or in the air against the effects of hostilities.” Article 51 – Protection of the civilian population “1.The civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations. To give effect to this protection, the following rules, which are additional to other applicable rules of international law, shall be observed in all circumstances.>The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited.>Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.>Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Indiscriminate attacks are: (a)those which are not directed at a specific military objective; (b)those which employ a method or means of combat which cannot be directed at a specific military objective; or (c)those which employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol; and consequently, in each such case, are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction.>Among others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as indiscriminate: (a)an attack by bombardment by any methods or means which treats as a single military objective a number of clearly separated and distinct military objectives located in a city, town, village or other area containing a similar concentration of civilians or civilian objects; and (b)an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.>Attacks against the civilian population or civilians by way of reprisals are prohibited.>The presence or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield, favour or impede military operations. The Parties to the conflict shall not direct the movement of the civilian population or individual civilians in order to attempt to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield military operations.>Any violation of these prohibitions shall not release the Parties to the conflict from their legal obligations with respect to the civilian population and civilians, including the obligation to take the precautionary measures provided for in Article 57. ...” Article 52 – General Protection of civilian objects “1.Civilian objects shall not be the object of attack or of reprisals. Civilian objects are all objects which are not military objectives as defined in paragraph 2.>Attacks shall be limited strictly to military objectives. In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.>In case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used. ...” Article 57 – Precautions in attack “1.In the conduct of military operations, constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects.>With respect to attacks, the following precautions shall be taken: (a)those who plan or decide upon an attack shall: (i)do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special protection but are military objectives within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 52 and that it is not prohibited by the provisions of this Protocol to attack them; (ii)take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental loss or civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects; (iii)refrain from deciding to launch any attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated; (b)an attack shall be cancelled or suspended if it becomes apparent that the objective is not a military one or is subject to special protection or that the attack may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated; (c)effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit.>When a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be that the attack on which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.>In the conduct of military operations at sea or in the air, each Party to the conflict shall, in conformity with its rights and duties under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, take all reasonable precautions to avoid losses of civilian lives and damage to civilian objects.>No provision of this Article may be construed as authorizing any attacks against the civilian population, civilians or civilian objects. ...” Article 91 – Responsibility “A Party to the conflict which violates the provisions of the Conventions or of this Protocol shall, if the case demands, be liable to pay compensation. It shall be responsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of its armed forces.” 31.The applicants also relied in the domestic courts on paragraph 5 of Article VIII of the London Convention of 19 June 1951 between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces, which ratified through Law no. 1335 of 1955. Article I defines certain terms as follows: “... (d)’sending State’ means the Contracting Party to which the force belongs; (e)’receiving State’ means the Contracting Party in the territory of which the force or civilian component is located, whether it be stationed there or passing in transit; ...” Article VIII provides, inter alia: “...>Claims (other than contractual claims and those to which paragraphs 6 or 7 of this Article apply) arising out of acts or omissions of members of a force or civilian component done in the performance of official duty, or out of any other act, omission or occurrence for which a force or civilian component is legally responsible, and causing damage in the territory of the receiving State to third parties, other than any of the Contracting Parties, shall be dealt with by the receiving State in accordance with the following provisions: (a)Claims shall be filed, considered and settled or adjudicated in accordance with the laws and regulations of the receiving State with respect to claims arising from the activities of its own armed forces. (b)The receiving State may settle any such claims, and payment of the amount agreed upon or determinated by adjudication shall be made by the receiving State in its currency. (c)Such payment, whether made pursuant to a settlement or to adjudication of the case by a competent tribunal of the receiving State, or the final adjudication by such a tribunal denying payment, shall be binding and conclusive upon the Contracting Parties. (d)Every claim paid by the receiving State shall be communicated to the sending States concerned together with full particulars and a proposed distribution in conformity with sub-paragraphs (e) (i), (ii) and (iii) below. In default of a reply within two months, the proposed distribution shall be regarded as accepted. (e)The cost incurred in satisfying claims pursuant to the preceding sub-paragraphs and paragraph 2 of this Article shall be distributed between the Contracting Parties, as follows: (f)In cases where the application of the provisions of sub-paragraphs (b) and (e) of this paragraph would cause a Contracting Party serious hardship, it may request the North Atlantic Council to arrange a settlement of a different nature. (g)A member of a force or civilian component shall not be subject to any proceedings for the enforcement of any judgment given against him in the receiving State in a matter arising from the performance of his official duties. (h)Except in so far as sub-paragraph (e) of this paragraph applies to claims covered by paragraph 2 of this Article, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any claim arising out of or in connexion with the navigation or operation of a ship or the loading, carriage, or discharge of a cargo, other than claims for death or personal injury to which paragraph 4 of this Article does not apply.>Claims against members of a force or civilian component arising out of tortious acts or omissions in the receiving State not done in the performance of official duty shall be dealt with in the following manner: (a)The authorities of the receiving State shall consider the claim and assess compensation to the claimant in a fair and just manner, taking into account all the circumstances of the case, including the conduct of the injured person, and shall prepare a report on the matter. (b)The report shall be delivered to the authorities of the sending State, who shall then decide without delay whether they will offer an ex gratia payment, and if so, of what amount. (c)If an offer of ex gratia payment is made, and accepted by the claimant in full satisfaction of his claim, the authorities of the sending State shall make the payment themselves and inform the authorities of the receiving State of their decision and of the sum paid. (d)Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the jurisdiction of the courts of the receiving State to entertain an action against a member of a force or of a civilian component unless and until there has been payment in full satisfaction of the claim.>Claims arising out of the unauthorized use of any vehicle of the armed services of a sending State shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 6 of this Article, except in so far as the force or civilian component is legally responsible.>If a dispute arises as to whether a tortious act or omission of a member of a force or civilian component was done in the performance of official duty or as to whether the use of any vehicle of the armed services of a sending State was unauthorized, the question shall be submitted to an arbitrator appointed in accordance with paragraph2(b) of this Article, whose decision on this point shall be final and conclusive.>The sending State shall not claim immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of the receiving State for members of a force or civilian component in respect of the civil jurisdiction of the courts of the receiving State except to the extent provided in paragraph 5 (g) of this Article. 10.The authorities of the sending State and of the receiving State shall co-operate in the procurement of evidence for a fair hearing and disposal of claims in regard to which the Contracting Parties are concerned. ...”",2006,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT OF CASSATION, SITTING AS A FULL COURT, IS ASKED TO DECLARE THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE, WITH ALL THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH THAT ENTAILS IN LAW.”
18.  IN A RULING (NO. 8157) OF 8 FEBRUARY 2002, WHICH WAS DEPOSITED WITH THE REGISTRY ON 5 JUNE 2002 AND CONVEYED TO THE APPLICANTS ON 11 JUNE 2002, THE COURT OF CASSATION, SITTING AS A FULL COURT (SEZIONI UNITE), FOUND THAT THE ITALIAN COURTS HAD NO JURISDICTION. IT REASONED AS FOLLOWS:
“...
2.  THE CLAIM SEEKS TO IMPUTE LIABILITY TO THE  ON THE BASIS OF AN ACT OF WAR, IN PARTICULAR THE CONDUCT OF HOSTILITIES THROUGH AERIAL WARFARE. THE CHOICE OF THE MEANS THAT WILL BE USED TO CONDUCT HOSTILITIES IS AN ACT OF GOVERNMENT. THESE ARE ACTS THROUGH WHICH POLITICAL FUNCTIONS ARE PERFORMED AND THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR THEM TO BE ASSIGNED TO A CONSTITUTIONAL BODY. THE NATURE OF SUCH FUNCTIONS PRECLUDES ANY CLAIM TO A PROTECTED INTEREST IN RELATION THERETO, SO THAT THE ACTS BY WHICH THEY ARE CARRIED OUT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC CONTENT – SEE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE FULL COURT OF 12 JULY 1968 (NO. 2452), 17 OCTOBER 1980 (NO. 5583) AND 8 JANUARY 1993 (NO. 124). WITH RESPECT TO ACTS OF THIS TYPE, NO COURT HAS THE POWER TO REVIEW THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FUNCTION WAS PERFORMED.
3.  WHILE THE PURPOSE OF THE PROVISIONS OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS GOVERNING THE CONDUCT OF HOSTILITIES – THE PROTOCOL ADDITIONAL TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS (ARTICLES 35.2, 48, 49, 51, 52 AND 57) AND THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (ARTICLES 2 AND 15 § 2) – IS TO PROTECT CIVILIANS IN THE EVENT OF ATTACK, THEY ARE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND SO ALSO REGULATE RELATIONS BETWEEN STATES.
THESE SAME TREATIES LAY DOWN THE PROCEDURE FOR FINDING A VIOLATION AND THE SANCTIONS IN THE EVENT OF LIABILITY (ARTICLE 91 OF THE PROTOCOL AND ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION); THEY ALSO DESIGNATE THE INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS WITH JURISDICTION TO MAKE SUCH A FINDING.
HOWEVER, THE LEGISLATION IMPLEMENTING THESE RULES IN THE  DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY EXPRESS PROVISION ENABLING INJURED PARTIES TO SEEK REPARATION FROM THE STATE FOR DAMAGE SUSTAINED AS A RESULT OF A VIOLATION OF THE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.
THE NOTION THAT PROVISIONS TO THAT EFFECT MAY IMPLICITLY HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE SYSTEM THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IS AT ODDS WITH THE CONVERSE PRINCIPLE THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED WHICH HOLDS THAT PROTECTED INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS ARE NO BAR TO CARRYING OUT FUNCTIONS OF A POLITICAL NATURE.
INDEED, IN ORDER TO ENABLE REPARATION TO BE PROVIDED IN THE DOMESTIC SYSTEM FOR LOSS SUSTAINED AS A RESULT OF A VIOLATION OF THE ‘REASONABLE TIME’ REQUIREMENT UNDER ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, [THE STATE] INTRODUCED APPROPRIATE LEGISLATION (LAW NO. 89 OF 24 MARCH 2001).
4.  NO ENTITLEMENT TO A REVIEW OF THE GOVERNMENT’S DECISION CONCERNING THE CONDUCT OF HOSTILITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE NATO AERIAL OPERATIONS AGAINST THE  CAN BE FOUND IN THE LONDON CONVENTION OF 1951.
THE FACT THAT THE AIRCRAFT USED TO BOMB THE BELGRADE RADIO AND TELEVISION STATION WERE ABLE TO USE BASES SITUATED ON ITALIAN TERRITORY CONSTITUTES BUT ONE ELEMENT OF THE HIGHLY COMPLEX OPERATION WHOSE LAWFULNESS IT IS SOUGHT TO REVIEW AND IS NOT THEREFORE RELEVANT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE RULE LAID DOWN IN PARAGRAPH 5 OF ARTICLE VIII OF THE CONVENTION, WHICH ON THE CONTRARY PRESUPPOSES THE COMMISSION OF AN ACT THAT IS AMENABLE TO REVIEW.”
19.  THE COURT OF CASSATION’S RULING BROUGHT TO AN END, IPSO JURE, THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE ROME DISTRICT COURT.
II.  RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE
20.  THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
ARTICLE 10 § 1
“THE ITALIAN LEGAL SYSTEM SHALL COMPLY WITH THE GENERALLY RECOGNISED RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.
...”
ARTICLE 24 § 1
“EVERYONE MAY BRING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TO PROTECT HIS OR HER RIGHTS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS.
...”
ARTICLE 28
“CIVIL SERVANTS, OTHER AGENTS OF THE STATE AND PUBLIC ENTITIES SHALL BE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CRIMINAL, CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, FOR ACTS COMMITTED IN BREACH OF RIGHTS. IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACTS, CIVIL LIABILITY SHALL EXTEND TO THE STATE AND PUBLIC ENTITIES.
...”
ARTICLE 113
“JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF RIGHTS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS IN THE ORDINARY AND ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS SHALL ALWAYS LIE AGAINST ACTS OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES.
IT MAY NOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED TO EXTRAORDINARY REMEDIES OR SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OF ACT.
THE LAW SHALL SPECIFY WHICH JUDICIAL BODIES ARE EMPOWERED TO SET ASIDE ACTS OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, IN WHAT CASES AND WITH WHAT EFFECTS.”
21.  ARTICLE 31 OF ROYAL DECREE NO. 1024 OF 26 JUNE 1924 PROVIDES:
“NO APPEAL TO THE CONSIGLIO DI STATO, SITTING IN ITS JUDICIAL CAPACITY, SHALL LIE AGAINST ACTS OR DECISIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH INVOLVE THE EXERCISE OF POLITICAL POWER.”
22.  ARTICLE 2043 OF THE CIVIL CODE PROVIDES:
“ANY UNLAWFUL ACT WHICH CAUSES DAMAGE TO ANOTHER WILL RENDER THE PERPETRATOR LIABLE IN DAMAGES UNDER THE CIVIL LAW.”
23.  ARTICLE 41 OF THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, WHICH DEALS WITH THE ISSUE OF JURISDICTION, PROVIDES:
“FOR SO LONG AS THERE HAS BEEN NO DETERMINATION OF THE MERITS OF THE PROCEEDINGS AT FIRST INSTANCE, ANY PARTY MAY SEEK A RULING ON A QUESTION OF JURISDICTION UNDER ARTICLE 37 FROM THE COURT OF CASSATION, SITTING AS A FULL COURT. ...”
ARTICLE 37 OF THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE PROVIDES:
“A RULING THAT AN ORDINARY COURT HAS NO JURISDICTION BECAUSE THE CASE CONCERNS A PUBLIC AUTHORITY OR IS WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF A SPECIAL COURT MAY BE MADE AT ANY TIME AND AT ANY LEVEL OF JURISDICTION, INCLUDING BY THE COURT OF ITS OWN MOTION.”
24.  THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE CRIMINAL CODE PROVIDE:
ARTICLE 6
“ANYONE WHO COMMITS AN OFFENCE ON THE TERRITORY OF THE STATE SHALL BE PUNISHED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITALIAN LAW.
THE OFFENCE WILL BE REGARDED AS HAVING BEEN COMMITTED ON THE TERRITORY OF THE STATE IF ALL OR PART OF THE ACT OR OMISSION AT THE ORIGIN OF THE OFFENCE OR ALL OR SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH ACT OR OMISSION OCCURRED THERE.”
ARTICLE 185
“RESTITUTION AND COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE.
THE COMMISSION OF AN OFFENCE SHALL GIVE RISE TO AN OBLIGATION OF RESTITUTION UNDER THE CIVIL LAW [ARTICLES 2043 ET SEQ. OF THE CIVIL CODE].
ANY OFFENCE THAT CAUSES PECUNIARY DAMAGE [ARTICLE 2056 OF THE CIVIL CODE] OR NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE [ARTICLE 2059 OF THE CIVIL CODE] SHALL IMPOSE AN OBLIGATION ON THE PERPETRATOR AND THOSE ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS OR HER ACTIONS UNDER THE CIVIL LAW [ARTICLE 2047 OF THE CIVIL CODE] TO MAKE REPARATION.”
“A COMMANDING OFFICER OF A MILITARY FORCE WHO, IN ORDER TO INFLICT DAMAGE ON THE ENEMY, ORDERS OR AUTHORISES THE USE OF A MEANS OR METHOD OF WARFARE THAT IS PROHIBITED BY LAW OR BY INTERNATIONAL TREATY OR WHICH IS IN ANY EVENT CONTRARY TO THE MILITARY CODE OF HONOUR SHALL BE LIABLE ON CONVICTION TO A MINIMUM OF FIVE YEARS’ IMPRISONMENT UNLESS THE ACT CONCERNED IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE UNDER A SPECIFIC STATUTORY PROVISION.
IF THE ACT RESULTS IN A MASSACRE, THE MINIMUM TERM OF IMPRISONMENT SHALL BE TEN YEARS.”
26.  IN A JUDGMENT OF 10 JULY 1992 (NO. 124/1993), THE COURT OF CASSATION, SITTING AS A FULL COURT, ESTABLISHED THE RULE THAT THE COURTS HAD NO JURISDICTION TO HEAR CASES AGAINST THE AUTHORITIES RELATING TO POLITICAL ACTS.
A TRADE UNION HAD BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST THE PRIME MINISTER, THE CIVIL SERVICE MINISTRY AND THE MINISTRY OF STATE EDUCATION ON THE GROUND THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THEIR UNDERTAKINGS. THE COURT OF CASSATION NOTED, INTER ALIA, THAT SUCH A FAILURE COULD ONLY ENGAGE THE GOVERNMENT’S POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY, BUT COULD NOT CREATE A RIGHT. IT RULED THAT THE COURTS HAD NO JURISDICTION TO HEAR THE CASE AFTER FORMULATING THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLE:
“LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS A POLITICAL ACT SINCE IT IS THE STANDARD MEANS OF PERFORMING POLITICAL AND GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS. THE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY’S CONDUCT IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS NOT, THEREFORE, CAPABLE IN LAW OF CAUSING INDIVIDUALS DAMAGE (WHETHER TO THEIR PERSONAL RIGHTS OR TO THEIR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS); IT CONSEQUENTLY ESCAPES ALL JUDICIAL SCRUTINY.”
27.  THE ITALIAN COURTS HAD IN FACT ALREADY EXAMINED THIS QUESTION IN A NUMBER OF EARLIER CASES AND HAD RULED THAT, AS THEY WERE POLITICAL IN NATURE, THE FOLLOWING ACTS ESCAPED THE SCRUTINY OF THE DOMESTIC COURTS:
(I)  A WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE JURISDICTION UNDER ARTICLE VII OF THE AGREEMENT OF 1951 BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY REGARDING THE STATUS OF THEIR FORCES (COURT OF CASSATION, THIRD CRIMINAL DIVISION, 21 MARCH 1962, NO. 1645, KINARDI AND OTHERS, GIUST. PEN. [CRIMINAL JUSTICE], 1963, III, P. 80);
(II)  THE ASSIGNMENT OF PROPERTY BELONGING TO ITALIAN NATIONALS UNDER THE LONDON CONVENTION OF 1951 (COURT OF CASSATION, SITTING AS A FULL COURT, 12 JULY 1968, NO. 2452, DE LANGLADE V. THE TREASURY, RIVISTA DIRITTO INTERNAZIONALE [INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW], 1969, P. 583);
(III)  A TRANSPORT MINISTRY DECREE SUSPENDING PERMISSION TO TRANSPORT GOODS TO  (ROME DISTRICT COURT, 18 MAY 1993, SOC. S. AND C. TRANSP. GMBH V. MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT, RIVISTA DIRITTO INTERNAZIONALE PRIVATO E PROCESSUALE [REVIEW OF PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PROCEDURE], 1995, P. 755);
(IV)  A DECISION BY THE MINISTRY OF EMPLOYMENT APPOINTING EMPLOYEES’ REPRESENTATIVES AS DELEGATES TO THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION (LAZIO REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE COURT, 20 AUGUST 1976, NO. 492, CISNAL V. MINISTRY OF EMPLOYMENT AND MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, ITALIAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, 1978-79, P. 184);
(V)  A DECLARATION OF WAR AND TREATY PROVISIONS RELATING TO COMPENSATION FOR WAR DAMAGE ( (I), 28 JANUARY 1985, NO. 106, PESTALOZZA V. THE TREASURY, TRIB. AMM. REG. [REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE COURT REVIEW], 1985, P. 381).
28.  THE FULL COURT OF THE COURT OF CASSATION DELIVERED A FURTHER JUDGMENT (NO. 5044) ON 11 MARCH 2004. IT CONCERNED THE JURISDICTION OF THE ITALIAN CIVIL COURTS TO HEAR CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE SUSTAINED BY A PERSON WHO HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY THE GERMAN MILITARY IN 1944 AND DEPORTED TO WORK FOR GERMAN INDUSTRY.  HAD PLEADED STATE IMMUNITY AND THE COURTS OF FIRST INSTANCE AND APPEAL HAD HELD THAT THEY HAD NO JURISDICTION TO MAKE AN ORDER AGAINST IT. THE COURT OF CASSATION CARRIED OUT A VERY EXTENSIVE EXAMINATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL TREATIES ON INTERNATIONAL CRIME, IMPRESCRIPTIBILITY, THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF STATES, IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION AND OF THE CASE-LAW OF VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS. IN HOLDING THAT THE IMMUNITY PLEA FAILED AND THE ITALIAN COURTS HAD TO DECIDE THE CLAIM, IT STATED INTER ALIA:
“... IN A DECISION NO. 8157 OF 5 JUNE 2002, THIS FULL COURT DID INDEED RULE THAT ACTS PERFORMED BY THE STATE IN THE CONDUCT OF HOSTILITIES ESCAPE ALL SCRUTINY BY THE COURTS, AS THEY ARE ACTS THROUGH WHICH ‘POLITICAL’ FUNCTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT. THE NATURE OF THESE FUNCTIONS ‘PRECLUDES ANY CLAIM TO A PROTECTED INTEREST IN RESPECT THERETO, SO THAT THERE MAY OR MAY NOT BE A SPECIFIC CONTENT TO THE ACTS THROUGH WHICH THEY ARE PERFORMED’. PURSUANT TO THIS PRINCIPLE, THE ITALIAN COURTS WERE HELD TO HAVE NO JURISDICTION TO HEAR A CLAIM AGAINST THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE AND THE ITALIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENCE FOR COMPENSATION FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF A NON-MILITARY OBJECTIVE DURING NATO AIR STRIKES AGAINST THE  OR FOR THE RESULTANT CIVILIAN DEATHS. IT IS READILY APPARENT, HOWEVER, FIRSTLY, THAT THE FACT THAT THE COURT CANNOT CONTEST THE MANNER IN WHICH THE ACTIONS OF THE SUPREME HEAD OF THE RES PUBLICA ARE CONDUCTED DOES NOT PREVENT IT FROM FINDING THAT A CRIMINAL OFFENCE HAS BEEN COMMITTED OR THAT THERE IS RELATED LIABILITY UNDER THE CRIMINAL OR CIVIL LAW (ARTICLES 90 AND 96 OF THE CONSTITUTION; SECTION 15 OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW NO. 1 OF 1953; AND SECTION 30 OF LAW NO. 20 OF 1962); SECONDLY, BY VIRTUE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF ADAPTATION ESTABLISHED BY ARTICLE 10 § 1 OF THE CONSTITUTION, THE ‘GENERALLY RECOGNISED’ PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW WHICH GOVERN THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES CONSTITUTED BY THE FREEDOM AND DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN BEING AND CHARACTERISE THE MOST SERIOUS ASSAULTS UPON THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE VALUES AS ‘INTERNATIONAL CRIMES’ HAVE ‘AUTOMATICALLY’ BEEN INTEGRATED INTO OUR SYSTEM AND ARE ENTIRELY APT FOR USE AS A STANDARD WHEREBY THE INJUSTICE OF DAMAGE CAUSED TO OTHERS BY INTENTIONAL OR NEGLIGENT ‘ACTS’ MAY BE GAUGED. IT IS EVIDENT, THEREFORE, THAT THE PRINCIPLES REFERRED TO IN THIS DECISION CANNOT BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE INSTANT CASE. ...
9.1  GRANTING IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION TO STATES WHO HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF SUCH WRONGDOING IS IN MANIFEST CONTRADICTION WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED NORMATIVE RULES BECAUSE IT CONSTITUTES AN OBSTACLE TO THE DEFENCE OF VALUES WHOSE PROTECTION, LIKE THESE NORMS AND PRINCIPLES, MUST ON THE CONTRARY BE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL FOR THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, EVEN TO THE POINT OF JUSTIFYING FORMS OF MANDATORY RESPONSE IN THE MOST SERIOUS CASES. NOR IS THERE ANY DOUBT THAT THE ANTINOMY MUST BE RESOLVED BY GIVING PRIORITY TO THE HIGHEST RANKING NORMS, AS THE JUDGES IN THE MINORITY (EIGHT TO NINE) STATED IN THEIR DISSENTING OPINION APPENDED TO THE JUDGMENT IN AL-ADSANI [V. THE UNITED KINGDOM [GC], NO. 35763/97, ECHR 2001-XI], BY PRECLUDING IN SUCH CASES ANY CLAIM BY THE STATE TO IMMUNITY FROM SUIT IN THE FOREIGN COURTS.”
29.  IN 1993 THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO SEND A MILITARY EXPEDITIONARY FORCE TO  TO PERFORM PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS. AFTER THE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE HAD RETURNED TO , IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT SOME OF ITS MEMBERS HAD ENGAGED IN THE TORTURE OF SOMALI PRISONERS. TWO MEMBERS OF THE EXPEDITION WERE CHARGED AND GIVEN PRISON SENTENCES. THEY WERE ALSO ORDERED TO PAY COMPENSATION TO THE CIVIL PARTY. IN JUDGMENT NO. 28154 OF 7 MARCH 2002, THE TEXT OF WHICH WAS DEPOSITED WITH THE REGISTRY ON 10 JULY 2002, THE  ORDERED ANOTHER ITALIAN SERVICEMAN AND THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE TO MAKE REPARATION FOR THE DAMAGE SUSTAINED BY THE RELATIVES OF A CIVILIAN WHOM THE SERVICEMAN HAD KILLED UNLAWFULLY.
III.  OTHER RELEVANT PROVISIONS
30.  THE APPLICANTS RELIED IN THE DOMESTIC COURTS ON THE PROTOCOL ADDITIONAL OF 8 JUNE 1977 TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 12 AUGUST 1949, RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF VICTIMS OF INTERNATIONAL ARMED CONFLICTS (PROTOCOL I). THE PROTOCOL, WHICH  RATIFIED THROUGH LAW NO. 672 OF 11 DECEMBER 1985, CONTAINS, INTER ALIA, THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS:
ARTICLE 35 – BASIC RULES

83,001-59456,Grand Chamber,"9.T.P., the first applicant, gave birth to her daughter, K.M., the second applicant, on 29 January 1983. T.P. was then aged 17 years. 10.Between 1984 and 1987, the local authority, the London Borough of Newham, suspected that the second applicant was being sexually abused, partly as a result of the second applicant having a persistent urinary tract infection, partly because of her behaviour, including a remark made at the children’s hospital where she was admitted for treatment. She had told a social worker that B., the first applicant’s then boyfriend, had “hurt my bum”. In or about March 1986, surgery took place to re-implant the second applicant’s right ureter into her bladder. At a date unspecified, she also had surgery to remove a false second kidney. She continued to have urinary problems and associated infections. 11.There were case conferences held by the local authority on 13 May 1986, 26 June 1986 and 8 October 1986. Concern was expressed, inter alia, about the applicants’ home situation, where there was “a steady stream of young men” and about the first applicant’s ability to protect the second applicant and general parenting skills. The social worker Mr P. had mentioned the possibility of sexual abuse with the first applicant. In a later affidavit, he stated that she appeared angry that it was a concern and claimed that she never left K.M. alone with anyone and that K.M. would tell her if anyone hurt her. 12.In June 1987, during a visit to their home, social workers obtained information regarding their living arrangements including the fact that XY, the first applicant’s boyfriend, lived with the applicants. Concern was expressed regarding the first applicant’s care of her daughter and a case conference was held on 2 July 1987 to which the first applicant was not invited. As a result of the conference, the second applicant was placed on the Child Protection Register under the category of emotional abuse. It was also agreed at the conference that the social worker Mr P would obtain the first applicant’s consent for the second applicant to have a disclosure interview at a child guidance clinic. A further medical examination of the second applicant at the children’s hospital discovered no medical cause for her recurrent urinary infection. The hospital considered it necessary that the second applicant should be admitted to hospital for further tests but agreed to await the outcome of the interview at the child guidance clinic. 13.On 13 November 1987, at a child guidance clinic, the second applicant was interviewed by a consultant child psychiatrist, DrV., employed by Newham health authority. The social worker, MrP., was present during the interview whilst the first applicant waited in an adjoining room. The interview was recorded on videotape. The second applicant was aged four years and nine months at this time. 14.In the course of the interview, the second applicant disclosed that she had been abused by someone named X. The first applicant’s boyfriend, XY, shared the same first name, X, as the abuser. The transcript recorded inter alia: “Dr V.: (referring to a drawing made by K.M.) Whose face is that then?... Is that anyone, anybody special that face or just any face? K.M.: X’s. Dr V.: X’s face OK. Then who’s X? Is X someone you know? K.M.: My mum’s X. Dr V.: Oh your mum’s X. What is that mummy’s boyfriend. Is it? K.M. shakes her head. ... Dr V.: ... Is X still living at home with you? K.M.: shakes her head. Dr V.: He’s not. K.M.: Thrown him out my mum. Dr V.: Your mum throwed him out did she. ... K.M.: He’s coming in tomorrow. Dr V.: He’s coming in no more. K.M.: No he’s coming in tomorrow. Dr V.: He’s coming in tomorrow. What X. K.M. nods.” 15.The first applicant was then interviewed, again on video, and informed that the second applicant had disclosed that she had been sexually abused by XY. She was told that the second applicant could not be returned home but would be taken to a local hospital for further examination. When the first applicant asked whether or not her daughter was being taken into care, she received no reply. Dr V. also told the first applicant that she could see the recording of the interview with her daughter at some point. 16.After the interview, the first applicant asked her daughter if she had been abused by XY. The first applicant stated that the second applicant denied that she had been abused by XY and told this to Mr P. When the first applicant became agitated and angry, Dr V. and Mr P. both concluded that the first applicant would be unable to protect the second applicant from abuse and that she was attempting to persuade the second applicant to retract her allegation. Mr P. and Dr V. came to the conclusion that it would be necessary to remove the second applicant from the care of her mother immediately. In comments made to the first applicant in her interview, the possibility that in due course she could see the video of the disclosure interview was referred to by Dr V. and Mr P. 17.Later, on 13 November 1987, the local authority applied successfully to Newham magistrates court for a place of safety order. The local authority stated that the second applicant had been abused, had identified XY as the abuser and there was a risk of further direct abuse or that the first applicant would pressure the second applicant into retracting her allegation. The first applicant was not in court. A place of safety order was granted for 28 days. 18.On 18 November 1987, the second applicant was examined by a doctor who found that there were signs consistent with anal interference but no significant vaginal findings. 19.On 24 November 1987, the first applicant, having excluded all men from her home, applied to the High Court for the second applicant to be made a ward of court. The local authority attended the application and argued that they should have care and control of the second applicant in order to protect her from the risk of abuse. The local authority was awarded care and control of the second applicant and the first applicant was granted limited access. The local authority did not volunteer the video of the interview with the child. 20.Contact between the first and the second applicant was severely restricted between November 1987 and November 1988. The first applicant was permitted initially two hours of supervised contact with her daughter each week at the foster parent’s home. Following concerns that the first applicant was trying to induce her daughter to retract her evidence and was causing her distress, that access was altered to no telephone calls and one supervised access visit per week at the social services’ office. The second applicant had no contact with her extended family, including her maternal grandmother who was terminally ill and died whilst the second applicant was in the care of the local authority. 21.During this period the second applicant continued to have urinary problems, including incontinence. In April 1988, she underwent another operation, which improved her condition, though she remained subject to frequent infections. 22.During 1988, the first applicant gave birth to a son, D., fathered by XY. D. was made a ward of court but the local authority did not apply to remove D. from the care of his mother and XY. 23.In or about October 1988, Dr B., who had been instructed on behalf of the first applicant in order to assist her in reaching a conclusion regarding the allegations that the second applicant had been sexually abused, obtained the consent of Dr V. to view the video recording of the second applicant’s disclosure interview. In his letter dated 17 October 1988 to the first applicant’s solicitor, he gave his firm opinion that the interview disclosed a high probability that the second applicant had been abused sexually and that there appeared to be little doubt that she was identifying the mother’s boyfriend as the perpetrator. He recommended that the first applicant be allowed to see the video. He referred to Dr V.’s continual insistence that the court would not approve of the first applicant seeing the video and gave his own opinion that the best interests of the second applicant would be served by her mother having access to the fullest possible information. Dr V. informed Dr B. that she would not consent to the first applicant having access to the video until after the full hearing in the wardship trial. 24.On 1 November 1988, during the wardship proceedings regarding D., Registrar Conn ordered that the video be disclosed within seven days. The health authority and Dr V. issued a summons proposing to intervene in the proceedings and applying for the video and transcript not to be made available to the first applicant. 25.In her affidavit of 8 November 1988, Dr V. expressed her opinion that medical confidentiality be attached to the video and that it should only be disclosed if in the interests of the child, which the circumstances showed was not the case. “It is my professional belief that for the parties to see the video recording is not in the interests of children, and in particular not in this case. The possible harm to children arises from them being in the position whereby their words or actions, given in confidence, may control events or decisions. Anger, unforgiveness or victimisation may well be directed at the child especially if the purpose of the viewing is to enable a party to seek to establish his or her innocence of alleged Child Sexual abuse or to confirm a party’s view that no Child Sexual abuse has taken place and that the child must be lying.” She had no objection to the lawyers and medical experts seeing the tape and transcript. 26.By reports dated 11 November 1988, Dr B. and a social worker for the local health authority gave their opinions that it was good and desirable practice for parents to see the interviews involving their children. Dr B. noted generally that the mothers of abused children would often be in a position to clarify details, including the identity of the alleged abuser. He also understood that the video had already been shown by the police to XY in the course of their investigation into the allegations of abuse and considered that it would appear against natural justice to deny the first applicant similar opportunity. He saw no risk of harm flowing to the second applicant from such disclosure. 27.On an unspecified date at or about that time, the first applicant’s solicitors had sight of the transcript. The transcript showed that the second applicant had shaken her head when asked whether the abuser was living at home and that she had identified her abuser as having been thrown out of the house by the first applicant. These matters, which were inconsistent with the identification of XY as the abuser, were raised by the first applicant’s solicitors with the local authority on or about 11 November 1988, when the summons concerning the video was to be heard. 28.On 21 November 1988, at a hearing in the High Court the local authority recommended that the second applicant be rehabilitated to the first applicant and XY for a trial period of four to six months at which point a final proposal would be made. In a report dated 18 November submitted for that hearing, a social worker for the local authority stated that the fact that the second applicant had been sexually abused had been acknowledged by all the psychiatrists in the case, that there was now doubt as to the identity of the abuser but that whoever it was, the second applicant had suffered a seriously damaging experience from which her mother had been unable to protect her. While there had been doubts as to the first applicant’s ability to be a “good enough parent”, it was noted that her situation had changed – she had “matured”, had had a second child and was in a stable relationship with the second child’s father. If over the trial period, any further abuse occurred, it was proposed that the second applicant be removed permanently with a view to adoption and that D.’s future be assessed. In her affidavit of 21November 1998, the first applicant said that she had been informed, and believed, that the video and transcript had been reviewed by the local authority who had concluded that her boyfriend XY was no longer a suspected abuser. Mr Justice Lincoln ordered by consent that the second applicant remain a ward of court and that interim care and control be committed to the local authority who had leave to place her with the first applicant. The matter was adjourned for a period of not more than six months. 29.The second applicant remained with the first applicant from that time onwards. In about November 1989, the final hearing took place in the High Court. The local authority advised the judge that there was no longer any concern that required the second applicant to remain a ward of court. The wardship was discharged. 30.On 8 November 1990, the applicants issued proceedings making allegations of negligence and breach of statutory duty against the local authority, the central allegation being that the social worker, Mr P., and the psychiatrist, Dr V., failed to investigate the facts with proper care and thoroughness and failed to discuss their conclusions with the first applicant. The health authority and Dr V. were also named as defendants. The applicants claimed that as a result of their enforced separation each of them had suffered a psychiatric disorder. 31.Both applicants were seen by a psychiatrist who diagnosed that they were suffering from psychological disturbance known as anxiety neurosis. He issued two reports, one dated 21 February 1991 and the second undated, concerning the effects of the separation and proceedings. 32.On 19 November 1992, Master Topley struck out the application as revealing no cause of action on the basis that Dr V. enjoyed immunity in suit as a witness or potential witness in proceedings concerning the abuse of the second applicant and that this acted to bar the applicants’ claims. The applicants’ appeal to the High Court was dismissed on 17 March 1993 by Judge Phelan who held that no claim could arise from any alleged right to custody of a child which would give rise to an award of damages. 33.In the Court of Appeal, the High Court’s striking out decision was upheld on 23 February 1994. The majority found that no claim for breach of statutory duty in respect of sections 1 and 18 of the Child Care Act 1980 could arise, due to the general nature of the duty, the imprecise terms in which it was couched and the fact that the alleged breach of duty took place before the child was taken into care under the statutory duty in question. They held in respect of the claims that Mr P. and Dr V. were liable in damages as professional persons who caused personal injuries that the local authority arranged for the disclosure interview to enable to decide whether or not to intervene in the performance of its statutory functions. The psychiatrist Dr V. was acting in order to advise the local authority and owed a duty of care to the local authority, not to the first or second applicant. Nor could the local authority be held liable for the negligent mistake made by the social worker in carrying out the statutory function of the local authority to make enquiries. Reference was made to the policy considerations weighing against imposing liability in such matters. However, the Master of the Rolls, Sir Thomas Bingham, dissented and stated that he believed that it could be argued that a common law duty of care was owed to the second applicant by the psychiatrist and the local authority (reported as Mv.Newham LBC; X v. Bedfordshire CC (CA) 2WLR 554). Leave was granted to appeal to the House of Lords. 34.On appeal to the House of Lords, the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal was upheld on 29 June 1995. Lord Browne-Wilkinson delivered the leading judgment concerning three cases, the Bedfordshire case, the Newham case (the applicants’ case) and the Dorset case (reported as X and Others v. Bedfordshire County Council [1995] 3 AER 353). 35.As regarded the claims for breach of statutory duty made in both the Newham and Bedfordshire cases, Lord Browne-Wilkinson held: “... My starting point is that the Acts in question are all concerned to establish an administrative system designed to promote the social welfare of the community. The welfare sector involved is one of peculiar sensitivity, involving very difficult decisions how to strike the balance between protecting the child from immediate feared harm and disrupting the relationship between the child and its parents. In my judgment in such a context it would require exceptionally clear statutory language to show a parliamentary intention that those responsible for carrying out these difficult functions should be liable in damages if, on subsequent investigation with the benefit of hindsight, it was shown that they had reached an erroneous conclusion and therefore failed to discharge their statutory duties. ... When one turns to the actual words used in the primary legislation to create the duties relied upon in my judgment they are inconsistent with any intention to create a private law cause of action.” 36.In respect of the applicants’ claim in the Newham case that the local authority and the health authority were vicariously liable for the actions of the social worker, Mr P., and psychiatrist Dr V. respectively, Lord Browne-Wilkinson said as follows: “In the Newham case [the applicant’s case] the pleadings and Mr Munby’s submissions make it clear how the case is put. The social worker and the psychiatrist, as professionals, owed a personal duty to the first plaintiff, the child, and to the second plaintiff, the mother, to exercise reasonable professional skills in the conduct of the interview with the child and to make proper enquiries. The social worker and the psychiatrist were each personally in breach of this duty, for which breach their employers ... are vicariously liable. ...” Like the majority in the Court of Appeal, I cannot accept these arguments. The social workers and the psychiatrists were retained by the local authority to advise the local authority, not the plaintiffs. The subject matter of the advice and activities of the professionals is the child ... the fact that the carrying out of the retainer involves contact and relationship with the child cannot alter the extent of the duty owed by the professionals under the retainer from the local authority ... In my judgment in the present cases, the social workers and the psychiatrist did not, by accepting the instructions of the local authority assume any general professional duty of care to the plaintiff children ... Even if contrary to my view the social workers and psychiatrist would otherwise have come under a duty of care to the plaintiffs, the same considerations which have led me to the view that there is no direct duty of care owed by the local authorities apply with at least equal force to the question whether it would be just and reasonable to impose such a duty of care on the individual social workers and the psychiatrist. ... In the Newham case [the applicant’s case] it is not alleged that the borough council was under any direct duty of care to the plaintiffs: the case is based solely on the vicarious liability of the council and the health authority for the negligence of their servants.” 37.In the Bedfordshire case, where the applicant children had argued that the local authority owed them a direct duty of care in the exercise of their child care functions, Lord Browne-Wilkinson stated, insofar as relevant, as follows: “I turn then to consider whether, in accordance with the ordinary principles laid down in Caparo [1990] 2 A.C. 605, the local authority ... owed a direct duty of care to the plaintiffs. The local authority accepts that they could foresee damage to the plaintiffs if they carried out their statutory duties negligently and that the relationship between the authority is sufficiently proximate. The third requirement laid down in Caparo is that it must be just and reasonable to impose a common law duty of care in all the circumstances ... The Master of the Rolls took the view, with which I agree, that the public policy consideration that has first claim on the loyalty of the law is that wrongs should be remedied and that very potent counter considerations are required to override that policy (see [1994] 4 AER 602 at 619). However, in my judgment there are such considerations in this case. First, in my judgment a common law duty of care would cut across the whole statutory system set up for the protection of children at risk. As a result of the ministerial directions contained in “Working Together” the protection of such children is not the exclusive territory of the local authority’s social services. The system is inter-disciplinary, involving the participation of the police, educational bodies, doctors and others. At all stages the system involves joint discussions, joint recommendations and joint decisions. The key organisation is the Child Protection Conference, a multi-disciplinary body which decides whether to place the child on the Child Protection Register. This procedure by way of joint action takes place, not merely because it is good practice, but because it is required by guidance having statutory force binding on the local authority. The guidance is extremely detailed and extensive: the current edition of “Working Together” runs to 126 pages. To introduce into such a system a common law duty of care enforceable against only one of the participant bodies would be manifestly unfair. To impose such liability on all the participant bodies would lead to almost impossible problems of disentangling as between the respective bodies the liability, both primary and by way of contribution, of each for reaching a decision found to be negligent. Second, the task of the local authority and its servants in dealing with children at risk is extraordinarily delicate. Legislation requires the local authority to have regard not only to the physical well-being of the child but also to the advantages of not disrupting the child’s family environment. ... In one of the child abuse cases, the local authority is blamed for removing the child precipitately; in the other for failing to remove the children from their mother. As the Report of the Inquiry into Child Abuse in Cleveland 1987 (Cmnd. 412) (“Cleveland Report 1987”) said, at p. 244: ‘... It is a delicate and difficult line to tread between taking action too soon and not taking it soon enough. Social services whilst putting the needs of the child first must respect the rights of the parents; they also must work if possible with the parents for the benefit of the children. These parents themselves are often in need of help. Inevitably a degree of conflict develops between those objectives.’ Next, if liability in damages were to be imposed, it might well be that local authorities would adopt a more cautious and defensive approach to their duties. For example, as the Cleveland Report makes clear, on occasions the speedy decision to remove the child is sometimes vital. If the authority is to be made liable in damages for a negligent decision to remove a child (such negligence lying in the failure properly first to investigate the allegations) there would be a substantial temptation to postpone making such a decision until further inquiries have been made in the hope of getting more concrete facts. Not only would the child in fact being abused be prejudiced by such delay, the increased workload inherent in making such investigations would reduce the time available to deal with other cases and other children. The relationship between the social worker and the child’s parents is frequently one of conflict, the parent wishing to retain care of the child, the social worker having to consider whether to remove it. This is fertile ground in which to breed ill-feeling and litigation, often hopeless, the cost of which both in terms of money and human resources will be diverted from the performance of the social service for which they were provided. The spectre of vexatious and costly litigation is often urged as a reason for not imposing a legal duty. But the circumstances surrounding cases of child abuse make the risk a very high one which cannot be ignored. If there were no other remedy for maladministration of the statutory system for the protection of children, it would provide substantial argument for imposing a duty of care. But the statutory complaints procedures contained in section 76 of the 1980 Act and the much fuller procedures now available under the 1989 Act provide a means to have grievances investigated though not to recover compensation. Further, it was submitted (and not controverted) that the local authorities Ombudsman would have power to investigate cases such as these. Finally, your Lordships’ decision in Caparo [1990] 2 A.C. 605 lays down that in deciding whether to develop novel categories of negligence the court should proceed incrementally and by analogy with decided categories. We were not referred to any category of case in which a duty of care has been held to exist which is in any way analogous to the present cases. Here, for the first time, the plaintiffs are seeking to erect a common law duty of care in relation to the administration of a statutory social welfare scheme. Such a scheme is designed to protect weaker members of society (children) from harm done to them by others. The scheme involves the administrators in exercising discretion and powers which could not exist in the private sector and which in many cases bring them into conflict with those who, under the general law, are responsible for the child’s welfare. To my mind, the nearest analogies are the cases where a common law duty of care has been sought to be imposed upon the police (in seeking to protect vulnerable members of society from wrongs done to them by others) or statutory regulators of financial dealing who are seeking to protect investors from dishonesty. In neither of these cases has it been thought appropriate to superimpose on a statutory regime a common law duty of care giving rise to a claim in damages for failure to protect the weak against the wrongdoer. ... In my judgment, the courts should proceed with great care before holding liable in negligence those who have been charged by Parliament with the task of protecting society from the wrong doings of others.” 38.Prior to the coming into force of the current legislation, the Children Act 1989, on 14 October 1991, the local authority’s duty in respect of child care was governed by the Child Care Act 1980. Sections 1 and 2 of the Child Care Act 1980 provided that: “1.It shall be the duty of every local authority to make available such advice, guidance and assistance as may promote the welfare of children by diminishing the need to receive or keep them in care. 2(1)Where it appears to a local authority with respect to a child in their area appearing to them to be under the age of seventeen- (a)that he has neither parent nor guardian or has been and remains abandoned by his parents or guardian or is lost; (b)that his parents or guardian are, for the time being or permanently, prevented by reason of mental or bodily disease or infirmity or other incapacity or any other circumstances from providing for his proper accommodation, maintenance and upbringing; and (c)in either case, that the intervention of the local authority under this section is necessary in the interests of the welfare of the child, it shall be the duty of the local authority to receive the child into their care under this section.” 39.Under section 28(1) of the Children and Young Persons’ Act 1969 any person, including a local authority could apply to a magistrate for the authority to detain a child and take him/her to a place of safety. There was power to grant the application if the magistrate was satisfied that the applicant had reasonable cause to believe inter alia that the child’s proper development was being avoidably prevented or neglected or that he/she was being ill-treated or exposed to moral danger. The order could last a maximum of 28 days, with no possibility of extension. Before the expiry of the order, it was necessary for the local authority to institute care proceedings under section 1 of the 1969 Act or to make the child a ward of court if it wished either to intervene in the exercise of parental control. 40.The place of safety order was replaced with the emergency protection order under section 44 of the Children Act 1989, which came into force on 14 October 1991. This provided for removal of a child on emergency grounds for a maximum period of 72 hours. 41.Section 76 of the Child Care Act 1980 permitted the Secretary of State to cause an inquiry to be held into any matter relating, inter alia: “the functions of the social services committee of a local authority, in so far as those functions relate to children.” 42.Pursuant to Part III of the Local Government Act 1974, as amended, the Local Commissioner for Administration (the Local Government Ombudsman) had the function, inter alia, of investigating written complaints by persons who claim to have sustained injustice “in consequence of maladministration in connection with ... action taken in exercise of administrative functions of local authorities”. On conclusion of an investigation, Local Government Ombudsmen could recommend an appropriate remedy, including the payment of compensation, where maladministration was found. 43.The power of the High Court to make a child a ward of court derives from its inherent jurisdiction. The effect is that the court assumes responsibility for the child and may make orders concerning any aspect of the child’s life. The child’s welfare must be the first consideration of the court. 44.As soon as the originating summons was issued, the custody of the child vested in the court. From that moment, the parties to the proceedings, including the local authority, only had such power and authority over the child as was conferred by the court. 45.In England and Wales, there is no single tort which imposes liability to pay compensation for civil wrongs. Instead there are a series of separate torts, for example, trespass, conversion, conspiracy, negligence, defamation etc. 46.Negligence arises in specific categories of situations. These categories are capable of being extended. There are three elements to the tort of negligence: a duty of care, breach of the duty of care and damage. The duty of care may be described as the concept which defines the categories of relationships in which the law may impose liability on a defendant in damages if he or she is shown to have acted carelessly. To show a duty of care, the claimant must show that the situation comes within an existing established category of cases where a duty of care has been held to exist. In novel situations, in order to show a duty of care, the claimant must satisfy a threefold test, establishing: –that damage to the claimant was foreseeable; –that the claimant was in an appropriate relationship of proximity to the defendant; –that it is fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant. These criteria apply to claims against private persons as well as claims against public bodies. The leading case is Caparo Industries v. Dickman ([1990] 2 AC 605). 47.If the courts decide that as a matter of law there is no duty of care owed in a particular situation, that decision will (subject to the doctrine of precedent) apply in future cases where the parties are in the same relationship. 48.The decision in X and Others v. Bedfordshire County Council ([1995] 3 AER 353) is the leading authority in the United Kingdom in this area. It held that local authorities could not be sued for negligence or for breach of statutory duty in respect of the discharge of their functions concerning the welfare of children. The leading judgment is reported at length in the facts above (see paragraphs 45-46). 49.Since the X. and Others case, there has been two further significant judgments regarding the extent of liability of local authorities in child care matters. 50.The Court of Appeal gave judgment in the W and Others v. Essex County Council ([1998] 3 All ER 111, judgment of 2 April 1998). This case concerned the claims by a mother and father (first and second plaintiffs), who had agreed to act as foster parents, that the defendant local authority placed G, a 15 year old boy, in their home although they knew that he was a suspect or known sexual abuser. During G’s stay in their home, the plaintiffs’ three children (fourth to sixth plaintiffs) were all sexually abused and suffered psychiatric illness. The plaintiffs brought an action against the local authority and the social worker involved, claiming damages for negligence and for negligent misstatement. On the defendants’ application to strike out the statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, the judges struck out the parents’ claims but refused to strike out the claims of the children. The Court of Appeal upheld his decision. The headnote for the judgment summarised the Court of Appeal’s findings as follows: “(1)... In the instant case, the giving of information to the parents was part and parcel of the defendants’ performance of their statutory powers and duties, and it had been conceded that it was arguable that those decisions fell outside the ambit of their discretion. Accordingly, since it had also been conceded that the damage to the children was reasonably foreseeable and that there was sufficient proximity, the question for the court was whether it was just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on the council or the social worker. Having regard to the fact that the common law duty of care would cut across the whole statutory set up for the protection of children at risk, that the task of the local authority and its servants in dealing with such children was extraordinarily difficult and delicate, that local authorities might adopt a more defensive approach to their duties if liability in damages were imposed, that the relationship between parents and social workers was frequently one of conflict and that the plaintiff children’s injuries were compensatable under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, it was not just and reasonable to do so. It followed that no duty of care was owed to the plaintiff parents ... (2)(Stuart-Smith LJ dissenting) It was arguable that the policy considerations against imposing a common law duty of care on a local authority in relation to the performance of its statutory duties to protect children did not apply when the children whose safety was under consideration were those in respect of whom it was not performing any statutory duty. Accordingly, since in the instant case, the plaintiff children were not children for whom the council had carried out any immediate caring responsibilities under the child welfare system but were living at home with their parents, and express assurances had been given that a sexual abuser would not be placed in their home, their claim should proceed ...” 51.On further appeal by the parents, the House of Lords on 16 March 2000 held that it was impossible to say that the psychiatric injury allegedly suffered by the parents, flowing from a feeling that they had brought the abuser and their children together or from a feeling of responsibility for not having detected the abuse earlier, was outside the range of psychiatric injury recognised by the law, nor was it unarguable that the local authority had owed a duty of care to the parents. The parents’ claim could not be said to be so certainly or clearly bad that they should be barred from pursuing it to trial and their appeal was allowed. 52.The House of Lords gave judgment on 17 June 1999 in Barrett v. the London Borough of Enfield ([1999] 3 WLR 79). That case concerned the claims of the plaintiff, who had been in care from the age of ten months to seventeen years, that the local authority had negligently failed to safeguard his welfare causing him deep-seated psychiatric problems. The local authority had applied to strike out the case as disclosing no cause of action. The House of Lords, upholding the plaintiff’s appeal, unanimously held that the case of X and Others v. Bedfordshire County Council did not in the circumstances of this case prevent a claim of negligence being brought against a local authority by a child formerly in its care. 53.Lord Browne-Wilkinson, in his judgment in that case, commented as follows on the operation of the duty of care: “(1)Although the word ‘immunity’ is sometimes incorrectly used, a holding that it is not fair, just and reasonable to hold liable a particular class of defendants whether generally or in relation to a particular type of activity is not to give immunity from a liability to which the rest of the world is subject. It is a prerequisite to there being any liability in negligence at all that as a matter of policy it is fair, just and reasonable in those circumstances to impose liability in negligence. (2) In a wide range of cases public policy has led to the decision that the imposition of liability would not be fair and reasonable in the circumstances, e.g. some activities of financial regulators, building inspectors, ship surveyors, social workers dealing with sex abuse cases. In all these cases and many others the view has been taken that the proper performance of the defendant’s primary functions for the benefit of society as a whole will be inhibited if they are required to look over their shoulder to avoid liability in negligence. In English law the decision as to whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a liability in negligence on a particular class of would-be defendants depends on weighing in the balance the total detriment to the public interest in all cases from holding such class liable in negligence as against the total loss to all would-be plaintiffs if they are not to have a cause of action in respect of the loss they have individually suffered. (3) In English law, questions of public policy and the question whether it is fair and reasonable to impose liability in negligence are decided as questions of law. Once the decision is taken that, say, company auditors though liable to shareholders for negligent auditing are not liable to those proposing to invest in the company (see Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 1 All ER 568, [1990] 2 AC 605), that decision will apply to all future cases of the same kind. The decision does not depend on weighing the balance between the extent of the damage to the plaintiff and the damage to the public in each particular case.” 54.At the relevant time, Order 18 rule 19 of the Rules of the Supreme Court provided that a claim could be struck out if it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. This jurisdiction has been described as being reserved for “plain and obvious cases”, in which a claim was “obviously unsustainable”. 55.In applications to strike out, the courts proceeded on the basis that all the allegations set out in the claimant’s pleadings were true. The question for the courts was whether, even assuming that the claimant could substantiate all factual allegations at trial, the claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. 56.The striking out procedure, now contained in the Part 3.4(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules in force since 1999, is regarded as an important feature of English civil procedure, performing the function of securing speedy and effective justice, inter alia by allowing it to be decided promptly which issued need full investigation and trial and disposing summarily of the others. By means of this procedure, it can be determined at an early stage, with minimal cost to the parties, whether the facts as pleaded reveal a claim existing in law.",2001,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

2,001-61549,Grand Chamber,"10.The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in . At the relevant time he was a member of the Royal Air Force (RAF). 11.On 18 February 1998 the applicant, along with a co-accused, was convicted by a district court-martial (pursuant to section 70(1) of the Air Force Act 1955) of theft contrary to the Theft Act 1968. He was sentenced to fifty-six days' imprisonment, to be dismissed from the service and to be reduced to the ranks. 12.The applicant's court-martial was composed of a permanent president (Wing Commander Rodgers), two other officers of lower rank (Squadron Leader Borthwick and Flight Lieutenant Winks) and a judge advocate. Wing Commander Rodgers' appointment to the post of permanent president was his last before retirement in September 1998. Although he had been the subject of appraisal reports prior to August 1997, he was not reported on thereafter. The two ordinary members had attended the junior officers' command course in 1993, which included training in disciplinary processes. 13.By a letter from the reviewing authority dated 3 April 1998, the applicant's representative was informed that neither the findings nor the sentence of the court-martial would be varied. The authority had received advice from the Judge Advocate General. 14.The applicant's appeal to the against conviction and sentence was dismissed on 5 February 1999. 15.The Armed Forces Act 1996 (“the 1996 Act”) came into force on 1April 1997 and amended, inter alia, the Air Force Act 1955 (references below to “the 1955 Act” are to that Act as amended). Trial by court-martial in the RAF is regulated, inter alia, by the 1955 Act, the Courts-Martial (Air Force) Rules 1997 (“the 1997 Rules”) and the Queen's Regulations for the RAF. 16.Section 70(1) of the 1955 Act provides that any person subject to air-force law who commits a civilian offence, whether in the or elsewhere, shall be guilty of an offence against that section. 17.Section 71(1) of the 1955 Act lists the punishments available to a court-martial following conviction and establishes, as a matter of law, the relative positions of each punishment in the hierarchy of punishments available (the “coda” to section 71(1) of the 1955 Act). 18.The powers of punishment of courts-martial (general and district) are set out in section 85 of the 1955 Act: “(1)A general court-martial shall have power to try any person subject to air force law for any offence which under this Act is triable by court-martial, and to award for any such offence any punishment authorised by this Act for that offence. (2)A district court-martial shall have the powers of a general court-martial except that it shall not try an officer or sentence a warrant officer to imprisonment, discharge with disgrace, dismissal or detention, and shall not award the punishment of death or of imprisonment for a term exceeding two years or make an order committing a person to be detained under section 71AA of this Act for a period exceeding two years.” 19.A person guilty of theft is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine or both (section 7 of the Theft Act 1968). 20.An allegation that a person subject to air-force law has committed an offence must be reported to the CO of the accused. The CO must investigate the charge, after which he may refer the matter to the higher authority (section 76(5)(b) of the 1955 Act). 21.The higher authority is a senior RAF officer (the Air Officer Commanding). He is not legally qualified. He must decide, in respect of cases referred to him by a CO, whether to refer the matter back to the CO to be dealt with summarily (unless the accused has already elected trial by court-martial); to refer the matter to the prosecuting authority for a decision as to whether the accused should be prosecuted; or to drop the charges. The higher authority's decision is essentially a command decision, the higher authority being required to ask himself whether there are service reasons for prosecuting or not. Once the higher authority has taken this decision, he has no further involvement in the case. 22.The role of prosecutor is performed by the prosecuting authority. He is appointed by the Queen and must have been legally qualified for ten years (section 83A of the 1955 Act). The prosecuting authority has a staff of between six to eight RAF officers, who are all legally qualified (section 83C of the 1955 Act) and employed full-time on prosecuting duties. The barristers on staff are, as members of the Bar of England and , subject to the professional and ethical duties of the Bar Code of Conduct (including a duty to act with independence and in the interests of justice). Similar professional obligations apply to the solicitors on staff, who are members of the Law Society of England and . Those lawyers also apply the Code for Service Prosecutors, which has been endorsed by the Attorney General. 23.Following the higher authority's decision to refer a case to it, the prosecuting authority has an absolute discretion, applying similar criteria as those applied in civilian cases by the Crown Prosecution Service, to decide whether or not to prosecute, what type of court-martial would be appropriate and what charges should be brought. The prosecuting authority also prefers the charges, conducts the prosecution (Part II of Schedule I to the 1996 Act) and, in particular, has the power to make all decisions concerning the prosecution (section 83B(7) of the 1955 Act). 24.The prosecuting authority (Air Vice Marshal Weeden) was, at the relevant time, also Director of Legal Services (RAF). In his prosecuting role, he was answerable solely to the Attorney General. As Director of Legal Services (RAF) he was answerable to the Air Member for Personnel/Commander in Chief of Personnel and Training Command. Air Vice Marshal Weeden was not reported on in relation to his performance as the prosecuting authority, although he was reported on in relation to his role as Director of Legal Services (RAF). Annual appraisal reports on prosecuting officers were drawn up by 1st reporting officers within the prosecuting authority. 25. CAOs are RAF officers appointed by the Defence Council. Once notified of a prosecution by court-martial by the prosecuting authority, a CAO is responsible for making the arrangements for courts-martial, including arranging venue and timing, ensuring that a judge advocate and any court officials required will be available, securing the attendance of witnesses and selecting members of the court-martial. Before commencement of the court-martial hearing, the power to dissolve it is vested in the responsible CAO. The Courts-Martial Administration Unit discharges the administration and functions of the CAOs on their behalf and at their direction. 26.A district court-martial comprises a judge advocate, a president and not less than two serving air-force officers (“the ordinary members”) of at least two years' experience in the RAF (section 84D of the 1955 Act). 27.The Judge Advocate General and his staff of judge advocates are appointed by the Lord Chancellor and are civilians who must have at least seven years' experience as advocates or five years' experience as barristers. A judge advocate is appointed to each court-martial (section 84D(1) of the 1955 Act) by the Judge Advocate General. 28.A judge advocate is robed and sits in the centre with the president and one of the members on his left and the other member on his right. A judge advocate's role during a court-martial is to ensure the fair and regular conduct of the proceedings. He controls the course of the evidence and rules on legal objections. All rulings and directions on questions of law (including questions of procedure and practice) are given by the judge advocate in open court and are binding on the court-martial (section 84B(3) and (4) of the 1955 Act). In this respect, judge advocates have available to them the same model directions (prepared by the Judicial Studies Board) as are available to Crown Court judges. Once the court-martial hearing has commenced, the power to dissolve it is vested in the judge advocate. 29.A judge advocate also delivers a summing-up and further directions in open court before the members of the court-martial retire to consider their verdict, in the same way as a Crown Court judge would direct the jury. The judge advocate does not retire with the president and ordinary members and has no vote on verdict: as the members of the court-martial are the sole arbiters of fact, they alone must decide whether the charge has been proved or not (section 96(1) and (1A) of the 1955 Act). Following the deliberation on verdict, the judge advocate checks the findings. If he is satisfied that they are not contrary to law, the findings are announced. If he is not so satisfied, he gives the president and ordinary members further directions in open court, following which they retire to reconsider their findings in the light of the judge advocate's directions (Rule 72(3) and (4) of the 1997 Rules). The judge advocate retires with the other members of the court-martial for the deliberations on sentence (during which he can give, if necessary, guidance on the appropriate sentence to be imposed) and votes on sentence. 30.The president of a court-martial ensures that the hearing is conducted in accordance with service tradition (Rule 33 (1) of the 1997 Rules). During the deliberations on verdict, the president chairs the discussions. 31.The post of permanent president was first created in 1941, not by any statutory provision but rather as a matter of policy. Permanent presidents were selected from among serving RAF officers of suitable age and rank; they have always had the rank of wing commander. Legal qualifications or experience were not required. The appointment was full-time, was usually expected to be for a period in excess of three years and, almost without exception, was the officer's last posting before his retirement. The Air Secretary had the power to terminate the appointment of a permanent president, although this never happened. While appraisal reports were not prepared on permanent presidents sitting in army courts-martial, such reports were made on those sitting in RAF courts-martial. However, the reports did not concern their judicial decision-making. 32.In R. v. McKendry (6 March 2000, unreported), the judge advocate held that a particular permanent president could not be regarded as independent and impartial for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. Although the ruling was limited to the particular case, recourse to permanent presidents was abandoned pending the outcome of the judgment of the House of Lords in R. v. Boyd, Hastie and Spear Saunby and Others (“R. v. Boyd and Others”). That judgment was delivered on 18 July 2002 (see paragraphs 63-76 below), but permanent presidents have not been reintroduced to RAF courts-martial. 33.There is no requirement that the ordinary members of courts-martial should have formal legal training (Rule 17(b) of the 1997 Rules). 34.Certain officers cannot be selected for courts-martial. Section 84C(4) of the 1955 Act provides that the CAO, the COs of the accused, members of the higher authority, investigating officers and all other officers involved in inquiring into the charges concerned are all excluded from selection. Rule17 of the 1997 Rules excludes from selection an officer serving under the command of the higher authority referring the case, the prosecuting authority and the CAO. The Queen's Regulations for the RAF (QR 1154(f)) further underline that, so far as is practicable, a court-martial is to be composed of officers from different RAF stations. 35.At the relevant time (between 1997 and early 2000), ordinary members were randomly selected from a volunteer database for each court-martial. Individual officers were allowed to volunteer by completing a standard form or, alternatively, over the telephone. The information so provided would be entered on a computer database by the CAO. When members were required for a court-martial, the CAO looked for members in the database who were not excluded from participating in a court-martial. If volunteers could not be found in this way, a station would be selected from an alphabetical roster in each command using a separate database. The station would then be notified of those officers on that station, if any, who were on the volunteer database and the station would then be responsible for designating the officer(s) and informing the CAO. 36.The ordinary members remain subject to RAF discipline in the general sense since they remain RAF officers, but they are not reported on in relation to the carrying out of their duties as members of the court-martial and, in particular, in relation to their judicial decision-making. Attempting to influence, or influencing, a member of a court-martial amounts to the common-law offence of perverting the course of justice and/or to the offence of conduct to the prejudice of good order and air-force discipline (section 69 of the 1955 Act). 37.When the members have been designated and the court-martial has been convened, the members are sent the Courts-Martial Administration Unit (RAF) briefing notes for court-martial members (see paragraphs 45-62 below) along with a list of prosecution witnesses. The members are required to examine the list and to tell the CAO if any of the witnesses are known to them. They are also advised that, should they subsequently discover that they do know someone, they should inform the judge advocate. 38.At the start of the court-martial hearing, the names of all of the members of the court-martial are read out and the accused can object to any sitting member (section 92(1) of the 1955 Act and Rule 40 of the 1997 Rules). Each member of an RAF court-martial must take the following oath: “I swear by Almighty God that I will well and truly try the accused before the court according to the evidence, and that I will duly administer justice according to law without partiality, favour or affection, and I do further swear that I will not on any account, at any time whatsoever, disclose the vote or opinion of any member of this court-martial, unless thereunto required in due course of law.” 39.Deliberations of the court-martial members are confidential, a member being forbidden to reveal any opinion or vote. The members of the court-martial are required to speak during deliberations, and at the close of deliberations to vote on verdict and sentence in ascending order of seniority. Decisions on verdict and sentence are reached by majority vote (section96 of the 1955 Act). The casting vote on sentence, if needed, rests with the president (section 96(5) of the 1955 Act) who, at the time of the applicant's court-martial, gave the reasons for the sentence in open court. Under the present procedure, those reasons are given by the judge advocate (Rule80(2) of the 1997 Rules). 40.All guilty verdicts reached, and sentences imposed, by a court-martial must be reviewed by the reviewing authority within prescribed time-limits (section 113 of the 1955 Act). Although ultimate responsibility rests with the Defence Council, the review is, as a matter of practice, generally delegated to the Air Secretary or to such officer who at that time is carrying out the duties of the Air Secretary (section 113(5)(b) of the 1955 Act). Post-trial advice is received by the reviewing authority from the Judge Advocate General, who advises whether or not the conviction or sentence should be altered in the convicted person's favour. This advice is not binding, but is generally accepted by the reviewing authority. It is disclosed to the accused, who has the right to present a petition to the reviewing authority. 41.The reviewing authority may substitute a finding of guilt which could have been made by the court-martial and if the court-martial must have been satisfied as to the facts which would justify making that finding (section 113AA(2) of the 1955 Act), and it may also “pass any such sentence (not being, in the opinion of the authority, more severe than the sentence originally passed) open to a court-martial on making such a finding as appears proper” (section 113AA(4) of the 1955 Act). The reviewing authority also has the power to quash any verdict of guilt and associated sentence and to authorise a retrial (section 113A(1) of the 1955 Act). It is then for the prosecuting authority to decide whether to seek a retrial. While the person concerned is not specifically heard by the reviewing authority on the question of retrial, the decision of the prosecuting authority to seek a retrial can be challenged by an accused as an abuse of process. If convicted following a retrial, an individual retains his access on verdict and sentence to the (see paragraphs 42-44 below). The reviewing authority gives a reasoned decision and, should it substitute a finding of guilt and/or sentence, that ruling is treated for all purposes as if it was reached or imposed by the court-martial itself. 42.The is a civilian court composed of judges from the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal. A convicted person has a right of appeal to the against both conviction and sentence (section 8 of the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act 1968, as amended – “the 1968 Act”). 43.An appeal against conviction will be allowed where the Courts-Martial Appeal Court finds that the conviction is unsafe, but dismissed in all other cases. The test of what is “unsafe” is the same as that applied in appeals against convictions by the civilian criminal courts. An appeal against sentence may be allowed where the Courts-Martial Appeal Court considers that the sentence is not appropriate for the case (section 16A of the 1968 Act). It has power, inter alia, to call for the production of evidence and witnesses, whether or not produced at the court-martial (section 28 of the 1968 Act). It can also authorise a retrial (section 19(1) of the 1968 Act). 44.In R. v. McKendry (judgment of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court of 20 February 2001), the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of absence without leave and was sentenced to, inter alia, 265 days' detention. The reviewing authority rejected his petition and Mr Justice Ouseley gave the judgment of the . Having noted in detail the advice of the Judge Advocate General to the reviewing authority, he quoted as follows from a prior judgment of the (R. v. Pattinson, judgment of 25 January 1999): “In our judgment, the Court has to bear in mind, in dealing with an appeal of this kind, ... the somewhat 'hybrid jurisdiction' which [the Courts-Martial Appeal Court] exercises; in that it is clearly free to correct any injustice, but it nonetheless has to be mindful that those imposing and confirming sentences, particularly, it is to be said ... in relation to an offence of desertion, are particularly well placed and indeed better placed than [the ] in assessing the seriousness of offending in the context of service life.” Mr Justice Ouseley continued: “The offence of going absent without leave, as indeed the offence of desertion, is not one in respect of which any civilian parallel exists. The sentencing considerations involve factors that are particular to the armed services, in respect of which their judgment and experience are entitled to great weight. A court should be reluctant to interfere with such courts-martial sentencing decisions, particularly where the Judge Advocate General has reviewed the matter and has dismissed the petition in the terms in which he did here. The considerations particular to this sort of military offence relate to the significance of the offence for the maintenance of military discipline and efficiency, the need for deterrence, the significance of rank and the availability of other measures from dismissal to loss of rank and pay, which are in many ways not available or not paralleled in the civilian sphere. Indeed some of those factors would also be of particular weight when the is dealing with offences which do have parallels in the civilian sphere, and would justify caution in interfering with courts-martial sentences; even more so do they justify caution when dealing with offences which have no parallel in the civilian sphere.” R. v. Holtby-Smith (judgment of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court of 26February 2003) concerned a retrial following a decision of the reviewing authority. Lord Justice Kennedy in the stated as follows: “The Reviewing Authority directed ... that the Prosecuting Authority consider whether there should be a retrial. That was an inappropriate direction on the part of the Reviewing Authority because under section 113A of the [1955 Act] the decision whether or not to order a retrial must be one for the Reviewing Authority itself and not for the Prosecuting Authority, though of course the Reviewing Authority could, if so disposed, canvas the views of the Prosecuting Authority, and of the proposed defendant, as to whether or not there should be a retrial. Following that, the Reviewing Authority was advised of the error of its approach and ... directed a retrial in the interests of justice ... If [such a] decision of the Reviewing Authority was to be challenged, it could only be challenged by means of judicial review ... ” In R v. Ball and R. v. Rugg (judgment of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court of 12 February 1998), the sentence of the court-martial was one year's detention and the reviewing authority substituted a sentence of one year's imprisonment. The quashed the latter sentence and replaced it with a sentence of nine months' detention. 45.The briefing notes are sent by the Courts-Martial Administration Unit to the members selected for a court-martial. The notes applicable at the time of the applicant's court-martial (February 1998) could not be located by the parties. The notes issued in July 1999 are described below. 46.The introductory part of the notes was entitled “Important points for members of courts-martial” and provided as follows: “Before trial>Read the accompanying briefing document.>Contact the Courts-Martial Administration Unit (CMAU) if you are wrongly described in the convening order.>If you think that you may not be eligible to sit as a member of the court-martial – e.g. because you know the accused or something about him or a witness, or for any other reason – tell the CMAU or, if you are already at court, ask to see the Judge Advocate privately and tell him. Do not mention your concerns to anybody else.>Do not attempt to find out any details of the case in advance of going to court, and do not speak to any one, or allow anybody to speak to you about it – including when you arrive at the unit where the court-martial is to be held. At the trial>Once the trial has started you must not talk to anyone about the case (other than the remaining members of the court when all together) for as long as it continues.>Listen carefully to the witnesses and advocates, and to what the Judge Advocate tells you; and reach your decision only on what you hear in court.>You may only question witnesses through the Judge Advocate, or with his permission.>You must not visit the scene of the alleged offence unless the Judge Advocate so directs, when everyone involved in the case will go. After the trial>You must never reveal anything to anyone about the deliberations on finding or sentence unless required to do so '... in due course of law'.” 47.Paragraph 2 of the briefing notes emphasised the central role of the judge advocate by telling the members of the court-martial that: “The main thing to remember is that the Judge Advocate will conduct the court-martial ... He will therefore decide all questions of law, practice and procedure ... He is a member of the court and his rulings and directions are binding on the other members of the court and, of course, the parties to the proceedings. Subject to the Judge Advocate's conduct of the trial, it will be the President's duty to ensure that the trial befits the traditions and standards of the Service; and, in particular, that officers and other persons under instruction do not interfere in the trial ... The following pages set out in general terms the order of events at a court-martial. Bear in mind, however, that the Judge Advocate may not follow it to the letter if he decides that the particular circumstances of the case do not warrant it. The Judge Advocate may also, if the interests of justice require, dissolve the court before conclusion of the trial.” 48.The notes went on to warn the members as follows: “3.When you arrive at the Unit, do not speak to any Unit personnel ... and certainly not to any Unit executive. If you disregard this direction you may find yourself inadvertently talking to, for example, a witness or a lawyer involved in the case, which in turn might result in you being debarred from the trial or, indeed, the trial being prejudiced. If someone has spoken to you and you have any doubts about your position in this respect, you must tell the Judge Advocate privately before the trial commences.>Mention has been made above of the President's duties. Apart from that, the function of the President and the other officer members is to decide, on the evidence, whether the accused is guilty or not guilty; and if guilty, then to decide, together with the Judge Advocate, the sentence to be imposed. The Judge Advocate will tell you all you need to know about the law and procedure in order to discharge those functions.” 49.Paragraph 6 informed the members that they were: “... exempted from occupying public accommodation on the accused's Unit. Justice must manifestly be seen to be done and this aim is assisted by your being seen to avoid local Unit influences.” 50.Paragraph 8 of the briefing notes went on to advise that: “Save for resolving any queries members may have about court etiquette and procedure (e.g. putting on and removal of head-dress, etc.) under no circumstances must the President purport to carry out any form of briefing with other members of the court in the absence of the Judge Advocate. However, he should at this stage make sure the officers under instruction are aware of their duty not to do anything which interferes with the conduct of the trial – e.g. must not say anything or make gestures or imply they have any prior knowledge about the case or the accused, etc.” 51.Paragraphs 9 and 10 provided: “9. It is the [CAO]'s duty to ensure that the officer members of the court are qualified to act as members, and are not ineligible in any way, i.e.: that they have the requisite number of years' commissioned service, for example; and that they have not sat as members of a court-martial which has tried the accused before, or been involved in any investigation or inquiry into matters relating to the subject matter of the charge against the accused ... However, if before the date of trial, you think you may be ineligible, or not qualified to sit, or for example know something about the accused which could prejudice your impartiality, or know someone who might be a witness in the case (you will receive prior notice from the CAO of persons who may be called as prosecution witnesses) you must not mention the matter to any other member but should tell the CAO who will, if necessary, arrange for your place on the court to be taken by someone else. If your concern about any of the above matters does not arise until you get to court, you must not talk about it to anyone else but should ask to see the Judge Advocate privately and tell him. Likewise, if during the trial you realise that, e.g. you know a witness, you should tell the Judge Advocate privately without mentioning it to anyone else. 10.Before the court is opened, the Judge Advocate may join you in your room briefly and, if he does, will answer any queries about this briefing document. If he does not meet you beforehand and you have any such queries, you should send him a message to that effect through the Court orderly.” 52.Paragraph 15 provided that the convening order would be read when everyone was assembled in the courtroom, that the members of the court-martial would identify themselves and that the judge advocate would ask the accused if he or she objected to any of the members. The judge advocate would then administer the oath to each member of the court-martial individually (paragraph 17 of the notes). 53.Paragraph 20 informed members that, when the opening formalities were complete: “... The Judge Advocate may then warn the court not to talk to anyone else about the case for as long as it continues. That includes family, friends, work associates, the prosecutor, defence counsel and, most importantly, the accused and anyone who may be a witness. To that end, other than when the Judge Advocate is sitting alone, members are not to leave the courtroom during the trial except to go to the lavatory, and for any overnight or luncheon adjournment; and are not to associate with Unit personnel either professionally or socially until it is over. Refreshments will be brought into the courtroom as required.” 54.Paragraph 21 of the notes provided: “The President and members must not, when taking refreshments in the courtroom, or at any other time, including when sitting alongside the Judge Advocate, look at papers lying on the desks of the Judge Advocate, prosecutor or defence counsel. Such papers might include information which the court must not see under any circumstances.” 55.Paragraph 29 (reflecting Rule 62(2) of the 1997 Rules) pointed out that the president and ordinary members of the court-martial might only put questions to a witness through the judge advocate. If at the end of the witness's evidence they felt that they must hear that witness on a particular question, then the question was to be passed on in writing to the judge advocate, who could put it to the witness in the correct way. 56. Paragraph 34 (drawing on Rule 69 of the 1997 Rules) provided that, following the addresses of the prosecuting and defence counsel, the judge advocate would sum up the main points of evidence and direct the other members of the court on the law relating to the case. The members of the court-martial were not to ask the judge advocate any questions during his summing-up, but they could ask in writing for further directions, which the judge advocate had to give in open court. 57.Paragraph 35 (reflecting rule 70 of the 1997 Rules) dealt with deliberations on the verdict: “While the court is deliberating on the findings, no one is to be present except the President, members and officers under instruction. The President and members are not to separate until the finding has been reached, unless the Judge Advocate directs that in the interests of justice they may separate ... If any person has to leave the courtroom for personal reasons, he must be told by the President not to speak to any person on any account. If the court wishes to hear again evidence recorded by the VCR, the Judge Advocate must be told and, on his direction, the court must be reopened and the passage read in open court.” 58.Further guidance on deliberations was given in paragraph 38 of the briefing notes: “The President will normally initiate the discussion on the issue of guilt or innocence. The President should ensure that every court member present gives his opinion as to the finding on each charge separately, in ascending order of seniority commencing with the junior member. A unanimous decision is preferable, but a majority of votes will decide the issue, and the finding of the majority will be recorded as the finding of the court. The President should write down the finding(s) on the record of findings sheet and sign it. Prior to reopening the court, the President should remind any members overruled by the majority that they must now adopt the finding of the court. This is important if it becomes necessary to consider the sentence, as their previous feelings should not influence their decisions.” 59.Paragraph 39 explained the process by which the judge advocate would review the record of the deliberations to check whether the findings were not contrary to law and his related powers (see also paragraph 29 above). This paragraph also noted that the judge advocate “may, for sentencing purposes, inquire into any finding of fact reached by the court during its deliberation on finding ... though it is anticipated he will exercise this power very sparingly”. 60.Paragraph 25 explained what was to happen when sentence was being considered, either after a guilty plea or following conviction: “The court will close to deliberate on sentence, i.e. no one will be present save for the members (including, of course, the Judge Advocate) and any person under instruction. The Judge Advocate will initiate discussion on the sentence and will inform the members, e.g. about punishments and the principles to be observed. Sentence will be determined by a majority of votes if necessary and the opinions of the officer members will be given orally in ascending order of seniority, commencing with the junior member. The Judge Advocate will decide where he votes in the order. In the case of an equality of votes, the President has a second or casting vote on sentence which is exercisable once, i.e. he has a final, determining vote. When sentence has been decided, it is entered on the record of sentence which the Judge Advocate will have. The President will sign that record, as will the Judge Advocate.” 61.Finally, paragraph 44 provided as follows: “After the President has announced the trial is concluded and directed the court orderly to carry on, and the Judge Advocate has dissolved the court, the President may invite the officers under instruction to express their views about the case. Thereafter, he should remind them of the oath of secrecy they have taken before releasing them. The court orderly should be instructed to burn or shred all scrap paper. ...” 62.An aide-mémoire for non-permanent presidents of courts-martial was annexed to the briefing notes (Annex A). This document described the court-martial procedures from the point of view of the duties and role of the president. Annex B to the notes outlined the court orderly's duties (essentially to ensure the smooth running of the court-martial). Annex C contained the general rules for personnel attending courts-martial which concerned the wearing of head-dress, seating arrangements for witnesses and members of the public and other matters of etiquette. 63.The appellants (from both the RAF and the army) had been convicted by a district court-martial (apart from one who had pleaded guilty). Their appeals to the were unsuccessful. Before the House of Lords, three of the appellants argued that the permanent president's role meant that their courts-martial lacked independence and impartiality. The remaining appellants challenged more generally the compatibility with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention of their trials by court-martial on charges of an offence against the ordinary criminal law. The House of Lords granted leave to appeal. 64.Prior to the delivery of the House of Lords' judgment in that case, a Chamber of this Court adopted its judgment in Morris v. the United Kingdom (no. 38784/97, ECHR 2002-I), in which the Chamber concluded that Mr Morris's (army) court-martial, convened under the 1996 Act, fell foul of the independence and impartiality requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. 65.Subsequently, the House of Lords unanimously dismissed the appeal in R. v. Boyd and Others. Lord Steyn, Lord Hutton and Lord Scott of Foscote agreed with the detailed judgments delivered by Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry. 66.Lord Bingham rejected the challenge to the impartiality and independence of the permanent president, agreeing with the Chamber's finding on the point in Morris, cited above: “I do not for my part doubt that ... the [was] correct. [Permanent presidents] are appointed to that office in the closing years of their service careers, whether in the army or the [RAF]. They are officers who have no effective hope of promotion and no effective fear of removal. While no doubt they are, as officers, answerable for any extra-judicial delinquency, as any judge might be, they are answerable to no one for the discharge of their decision-making function. The only factual matters on which [the appellants] could rely were the reports written on Wing Commander Chambers who presided [at one of the RAF courts-martial] (there being no report on any army [permanent president]). It would in my opinion be preferable if no annual report were written on officers serving as [permanent presidents], but those on Wing Commander Chambers gave no support in substance to [the appellants'] argument. While praising the wing commander's efficiency and effectiveness as a [permanent president], they made no allusion at all to the quality or outcome of any of his judicial decisions, but instead made express reference to the isolated, unsupervised and independent nature of his role. There is no substance in this challenge.” 67.As to the role of the ordinary or junior members of the court-martial, Lord Bingham found as follows: “It goes without saying that any judgment of the commands great respect, and section 2(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires the House to take any such judgment into account, as it routinely does. There were, however, a large number of points in issue in Morris v. the United Kingdom, and it seems clear that on this particular aspect the did not receive all the help which was needed to form a conclusion. It is true that the junior officers who sit on courts-martial have very little legal training, but that is also true of the [permanent president] whose presence was accepted [in Morris] as a guarantee of the rights of the accused. It is also true that junior officers sitting on courts-martial remain subject to army discipline and reports. But there is nothing to suggest that any report ever is or ever has been made on any junior officer's decision-making as a member of a court-martial, and it is hard to see how any such report could be made given the prohibition on disclosure of the deliberations of the tribunal in the oath taken by the members. There is nothing to suggest that they remain subject to service discipline in relation to their judicial decision-making, and again it is hard to see how they could. It is true that there is no statutory bar on an officer being made subject to external army influence when sitting on the case. Any person seeking to influence the decision of a sitting member of a court-martial otherwise than at the hearing would, however, be at risk of prosecution either for perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice or under section 69 of the 1955 Act. The officer members are drawn from a different command from the accused. Briefing notes sent to officer members of courts-martial before they sit enjoin them not to 'speak to any unit personnel and certainly not to any unit officer who may be attending the trial in an official capacity or as a spectator'. They are instructed in writing not to talk to anyone about the case (other than the other members of the court-martial, when all are together) for as long as the trial continues, and this instruction is routinely emphasised by the judge advocate. The officers do not occupy accommodation at the unit of the accused and are told to be seen to avoid 'local unit influences'. They are instructed 'not to associate with Formation or Unit personnel either professionally or socially until the trial is over'. At the outset of the hearing the officers take an oath in terms quoted by the in [paragraph 27 of its judgment in Morris], swearing to try the accused 'according to the evidence' and to 'administer justice according to the Army Act 1955 without partiality, favour or affection'. In considering the independence and impartiality of the [permanent president] both the [Courts-Martial Appeal Court in the appellants' cases] and the European Court in Morris ... attached weight to established convention and practice. In my opinion the rules governing the role of junior officers as members of courts-martial are in practice such as effectively to protect the accused against the risk that they might be subject to 'external army influence', as I feel sure the European Court would have appreciated had the position been more fully explained.” 68.Turning to the criticism of the reviewing authority in Morris, Lord Bingham noted: “Its role can certainly be seen as anomalous, since ordinarily a binding decision of any court cannot be disturbed otherwise than (exceptionally) by itself or by a superior appellate court. It is however to be noted that the review of conviction and sentence carried out by the reviewing authority, whether the accused seeks such review or not ... cannot work otherwise than to the advantage of the accused. The reviewing authority cannot substitute conviction of a more serious offence, nor can it substitute a sentence which is in its opinion more severe (section 113AA(4)). This subsection does not confer a discretion, but calls for an exercise of judgment. It is essentially the same exercise of judgment as is required of the Court of Appeal ... which has not given rise to difficulty in practice. If the reviewing authority were to substitute a sentence which the accused considered to be more severe than that imposed by the court-martial, it would be open to the accused to challenge the substituted sentence on appeal to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, and it is important to note that the intervention of the reviewing authority in no way diminishes the rights of the accused on appeal. It is difficult to see any analogy with the situation which the considered in Brumarescu v. Romania ... where the applicant, with a final and irreversible judgment of a court in his favour, was deprived of the benefit of that judgment by a later decision in proceedings initiated by a party not involved in the earlier case. If a court-martial is not an independent and impartial tribunal for the trial of civil offences committed by service personnel in and , the reviewing authority could not be relied on to save it. But if it is, I find it difficult to understand how the role of the reviewing authority can undermine or reduce its independence and impartiality. [The appellants] recognised the difficulty of this argument and did not seek to sustain the judgment of the on the point.” 69.The appellants had also generally argued that the whole culture of the services was such as to incline those who took part in courts-martial to attach excessive weight to the values of discipline and morale, to the point of rendering a trial unfair. It was argued that the ritual accompanying courts-martial was oppressive and unfair. Lord Bingham observed: “I would for my part have no hesitation in agreeing that a court-martial is a court of law, not a parade, and its procedures (while properly involving some formality) should be those appropriate to a court of law and not the parade ground. I would also accept that officers serving on courts-martial will disapprove of those found to have acted in breach of the law governing their respective service. But judges and jurors in the Crown Court will similarly disapprove of those found to have infringed the ordinary criminal law. There is no reason to think that in the former case any more than in the latter such disapproval will infect the tribunal's approach to deciding whether the particular accused has broken the law in the manner charged. Officers will appreciate, better than anyone, that to convict and punish those not shown to be guilty is not to promote the interests of good discipline and high morale but to sow the seeds of disaffection and perhaps even mutiny. In the absence of any evidence at all to support it, I could not accept the suggestion that any modern officer would, despite the oath he has taken, exercise his judgment otherwise than independently and impartially or be thought by any reasonable and informed observer to be at risk of doing so.” 70.Lord Rodger rejected the suggestion that, by its very nature, a trial of a civilian offence by court-martial was incompatible with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and he referred, in this respect, to this Court's judgment in Engel and Others v. the Netherlands (judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no.22) and to Morris (cited above, § 59). Since the trial by court-martial did not in itself violate Article 6 § 1, the decision as to whether the court-martial was to be regarded as an independent and impartial tribunal depended on the safeguards which were in place. He noted generally in this respect: “A submission of this kind requires one, as a starting-point, to consider what is meant by the requirement that a tribunal should be independent and impartial. As the noted in Morris ... the concepts of independence and objective impartiality are closely linked. In the present cases, in substance, the court-martial must be guarded from the risk of influence by the prosecution and guarded from the risk of influence by the relevant service authorities, especially superior officers who might wish to secure some particular result, supposedly in the interests of the morale or discipline of the service or of some particular unit. As a result of the abolition of the role of the convening officer by the 1996 Act, no issue was raised in these cases as to the independence of the members of the tribunal from the prosecution. On the other hand, Article 6 does not require that the members of the tribunal should not share the values of the military community to which they belong any more than it requires that the judge or members of the jury in a civil court should be divorced from the values of the wider community of which they form part. What matters is that, while sharing the values of the service community, the members of the court-martial should put aside any prejudices which they may have and act – and be seen to act – independently and impartially in deciding the issues in the case before them.” 71.As to permanent presidents, Lord Rodger observed that, while there had been no appraisal reports on permanent presidents in the army since 1997, the RAF had continued the practice of preparing reports on permanent presidents. He was of the view that “that practice [was] undesirable and, as the army experience show[ed], unnecessary. It would be better if it were discontinued”. However, he went on to observe that such reports generally, and the ones completed in the case before him, commented on the manner in which the permanent president had tackled his role as a permanent president (referring to the administrative aspects of the job) and did not bear on his actual decisions when sitting in a court-martial. Indeed, Lord Rodger noted that the reports in question had recognised that the permanent president's role was one in which the president was “isolated and unsupervised and which require[d] independence” which the Air Secretary “honour[ed] and respect[ed]”. The reports did not therefore give the slightest reason to doubt the permanent president's independence. On the contrary, he considered that “ ... all involved in making these reports were well aware of the need not to intrude upon the decisions reached by him when sitting as president. Even had anyone wished to intrude, the oath of secrecy taken by the members of courts-martial would have made it impossible to investigate those decisions.” 72.As to the other members of the court-martial, Lord Rodger noted the conclusion of the Chamber in Morris. He also observed, however, that “for whatever reason ... the was given rather less information than the [House of Lords] about the safeguards relating to the officers serving on courts-martial”. He drew parallels between the members of the court-martial and jurors, noting that, while jurors brought certain prejudices and experiences with them to a trial, the safeguards of an oath and the trial judge's directions were considered by the domestic courts and by the European Court to be sufficient to ensure that jurors put aside their prejudices and reached a just verdict on the evidence. The members of courts-martial took a similar oath and the judge advocate gave them the same kind of directions which a trial judge would have given jurors: there was no reason to suppose that members of a court-martial would be less faithful to their oath or less diligent in applying the directions given by the judge advocate than would jurors, particularly when “trust and obedience to commands” were important to the officers sitting on a court-martial. 73.Indeed, Lord Rodger considered that the steps taken to ensure that the members of a court-martial acted independently and impartially were, on one view, even more strict than with a jury. Those steps had not, he noted, been outlined to the Chamber in Morris. He went on to detail those steps. In this connection, he referred to the briefing notes sent to members of the court-martial and noted as relevant safeguards those matters outlined at paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 20, 21, 25, 29, 30, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40, 42 and 45 of those notes. Lord Rodger commented on these safeguards as follows: “The various provisions which I have quoted from the briefing notes for the members of courts-martial reinforce significantly the message, proclaimed in any event by the oath and the directions of the judge advocate, that the members are to act independently and impartially. In order to be seen to avoid local unit influences, the members are not to stay in public accommodation at the accused's unit. They are not to speak to unit personnel and especially not to any officer who may be attending the trial – at the risk of being debarred from the trial or indeed of the trial being prejudiced. They are not to associate either professionally or socially with such personnel until the trial is over. There is a veto on the president briefing the other members of the court in the absence of the judge advocate. The members are to tell the court administration officer if they know something about the accused which could prejudice their impartiality or if they know someone who might be a witness in the case. The members are warned not to talk to anyone else about the case as long as it continues. They are not to look at any papers which are before the judge advocate, prosecutor or defence counsel, for fear of seeing something which they ought not to. When they deliberate on conviction or sentence, the most junior member is to give his opinion orally first – again, obviously, with the aim of ensuring that the junior members express their own personal view, uninfluenced by the more senior members. In terms of the members' oath their deliberations are to be kept secret and this secrecy is further ensured by the instruction to the court orderly at the end of the proceedings to burn or shred all scrap paper. Again, the object is to prevent the members feeling, or coming under, any outside pressure during or after the trial by reason of their participation in the decision in the case. [The appellants] did not suggest that these were other than genuine instructions to the members which they were intended to observe. Nor was it suggested that the instructions were in practice ignored or that they had been ignored in these particular cases. But if they are indeed observed, I find it hard, if not impossible, to see how anyone either in the court or, more particularly, outside the court could improperly influence the members' decision either on conviction or on sentence. Certainly, it is hard to see what more could be done to ensure that, while sitting in the court-martial, the officers act not as officers subject to command but as independent and impartial members of the court, reaching the verdict and determining the sentence according to law but according also to their own individual conscience.” 74.Lord Rodger noted that there were, however, two differences between members of a court-martial and an ordinary jury, differences which he concluded did not undermine the independence of the former: “First, the routines, the periods of boredom and the pleasures, pains and pressures of service life would be unknown to most jurors today, although they would have been familiar to many of their fathers and grandfathers. By contrast, members of a court-martial know all about them and about the society in which the accused lives and works. [The appellants' counsel] suggested that officers on a court-martial, imbued by their training with notions of rank and discipline, would always tend to believe the evidence of a fellow officer or a non-commissioned officer rather than the evidence of a private. By contrast, he said, members of a jury, who carried no such burden of preconceptions, would be able to see more clearly and judge purely on the evidence before them. Of course, this submission was really just a matter of assertion. There was, and could be, no evidence to back it up. Indeed, it was somewhat undermined by the conviction of [two of] the appellants ... [Those appellants'] conviction was based on the evidence of [two Guardsmen] ... In accepting the guardsmen's evidence, the court-martial must have disbelieved the evidence of their superiors in rank ... In any event, it is possible to fashion an argument – equally a matter of assertion – that officers who are familiar with service life and who are in close contact with service personnel of all ranks may well be less impressed by mere rank and better able to gauge the underlying realities than jurors confronted for the first time with officers or non-commissioned officers telling an apparently plausible tale. Viewed in this light, the specialised knowledge and experience of the members of a court-martial could be seen as a positive advantage rather than as a disadvantage. However that may be, I see no reason to think that, when duly directed by the judge advocate, officers on a court-martial cannot properly assess the evidence and return a true verdict based on it. I therefore reject the appellants' argument on this point. The members of a court-martial perform a role in deciding sentence which is no part of a jury's function in the . I accept that, in determining sentence, the members will indeed have regard to such issues as the impact of the offence on service morale and discipline. They will, inevitably, be more aware of these effects than a civil judge would be. Therefore, while the safeguards of the independence and impartiality of the members should mean that they approach their verdict in much the same way as jurors in a civil trial, it cannot be assumed that, when passing sentence, the court-martial will necessarily give exactly the same weight to these service factors as would a Crown Court judge. The sentences which a court-martial passes may therefore not coincide exactly with the sentences which a civil judge would pass on the same facts. In my view that does not call the decisions of the courts-martial into question, either generally or in terms of Article 6. Any difference in sentencing does not mean that the members are not independent or impartial, but merely that, though both independent and impartial, they may assess the various factors differently ... There are ... two additional points to bear in mind. The first is that the judge advocate advises the other members on sentence and also has a vote on sentence. He will be able to bring to bear his informed view as a lawyer on what sentence would be suitable. The second safeguard is that any sentence imposed by the court-martial is subject not only to review by the reviewing authority but also to appeal, on the ground that it is not appropriate, with the leave of the []. The members of the [] are civil judges and are in a position to correct any inappropriate punishment that the court-martial may impose by reason of the members' military background.” 75.Lord Rodger considered that all of these matters had to be borne in mind when considering the particular characteristics of the members of the court-martial to which the Chamber attached importance in Morris. He went on to identify and disagree with the specific concerns expressed by the Chamber in that case as regards the independence of the ordinary members: “The first was that the officer members had no legal training. That applies also in the present cases and indeed must apply in virtually all cases. As the briefing notes show, officers who may be called upon to sit on courts-martial are given some training by being allowed to sit and observe proceedings, including the members' deliberations. This should mean that, when they are eventually asked to sit, they should not find the procedures wholly unknown or strange, but it goes no further than that. While in Morris v. the United Kingdom the Third Chamber seems to have regarded the lack of formal legal training as a significant defect, as I have already noted, in Engel v. the Netherlands ... the European Court held that the Dutch Supreme Military Court was an independent and impartial tribunal, even though four of the six members were military officers with no legal training. Given the other safeguards which were in place in the present cases, I see no reason to conclude that the absence of legal training undermined the members' independence and impartiality. The attached importance to the fact that the officers, other than the permanent president, remained subject to army discipline and reports. In so far as the members of the courts-martial in the present cases also remained subject to service discipline, they simply shared the characteristic of all serving members of the armed forces. It must have been equally true of the military members of the in Engel v. the Netherlands. Moreover, the fuller information available to the House about the safeguards in place to protect the independence of the members of courts-martial shows clearly, in my view, that, just like the Dutch officers in Engel v. the Netherlands, the officers in these cases would not have been under the command of any higher authority in their function as members of the courts-martial. Indeed, as [the Ministry of Defence] pointed out, contrary to the assumption of the , there was even a formal legal bar to any superior officer trying to influence their decision, since this would have constituted the criminal offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice. It is true, of course, that, as in Morris v. United Kingdom, so also in these cases, leaving aside the permanent presidents, the officers sitting on the courts-martial would have remained subject to reports. [The appellants] indeed drew attention to a number of such reports where mention is made of the fact that, during the year in question, the officer concerned had sat as a member of a court-martial. In itself that must be unobjectionable since the information that the particular officer has had this experience may be relevant at some future date if, for instance, consideration is being given to appointing a permanent president. What would be objectionable would be any report which made reference, whether favourable or unfavourable, to an officer's decisions when sitting on a court-martial. But [the appellants] could point to no report where this had been done. The only report which referred to an officer's performance in relation to a court-martial was one relating to [one officer]: 'Her foray into the court-martial arena has brought particular accolades for her thoughtful and incisive contribution to the legal process'. The report showed that [that officer] had acted not only as junior member on several courts-martial but also as assistant defending officer to an airman tried by a general court-martial. It appears that the comment may well have related to this second role. In any event the report makes no comment on any decision reached by [that officer] when sitting as a member of a court-martial. Indeed counsel for the [Ministry of Defence] showed the House a number of statements from officers concerned with personnel matters who had read thousands of annual reports and had never seen mention of such a thing. That being so, again with the benefit of this more detailed information, I would not share the view of the European Court in Morris v. the United Kingdom that the independence and impartiality of officers sitting on courts-martial are compromised by the fact that they remain subject to the system of annual reports. For all these reasons I consider that those charged with administering the system of courts-martial have been at pains to put in place a series of practical safeguards which are designed to secure the independence and impartiality of those sitting on these courts. Nor is this surprising. There is not a little force in the point made by the [Courts-Martial Appeal Court] that, if service factors are to be seen as an aspect or function of the public interest, they will themselves require that the court-martial process should be, and should be seen to be, fair and impartial and, so far as possible, to achieve accurate results. Otherwise both servicemen and the public would lose confidence in it, with consequential effects on good order and discipline. Having regard in particular to the additional information which was not before the , I would therefore hold that the safeguards built into the system are indeed such that no fair-minded and informed observer who had considered them would conclude that there was a real possibility that the courts-martial in these cases lacked independence or impartiality in this respect. In other words they were, objectively, independent and impartial. I would accordingly reject the Article 6 challenge based on the role of the officer members.” 76.Finally, Lord Rodger turned to the reviewing authority and to the finding in Morris that the role played by that authority constituted in itself a reason for finding that a court-martial had not been independent or impartial. Lord Rodger did not agree. Indeed, he noted that even the appellants before him had difficulty in supporting the Chamber's reasoning in Morris on this point. He continued: “The reviewing authority is, admittedly, an unusual institution. It does not operate like an ordinary court and, at a certain level of abstract theory, its existence could seem to be inconsistent with the charge against an accused being determined by only a system of 'tribunals'. That appears to be the way in which the has treated it. But if, as the court indicates, the issue can also be characterised as relating to the independence of the court-martial, I find it difficult to see how the existence of this body affects that independence. It might, of course, be different if there were any suggestion that the decisions of the courts-martial were influenced by the existence of the reviewing authority, for example, because they tended to convict more readily or to impose heavier sentences in the knowledge that the reviewing authority could always quash them. But [the appellants] made no such submission and there is nothing whatever in the information before the House that would support it. On the contrary, [the appellants] accepted that the provision for review could only be to the benefit, and not to the detriment, of someone who had been convicted. In particular, it could provide a quick and simple means of correcting a mistaken decision by a court-martial. ... In reaching its conclusion on this point the European Court was particularly concerned by the fact that the decision as to whether any substituted sentence was more or less severe than that imposed by the court-martial would have been left to the discretion of the reviewing authority. When making this observation the Court does not appear to have been referred to, or to have had in mind, the coda to section 71(1) of the [1955 Act] which establishes, as a matter of law, the relative positions of particular punishments in the hierarchy of punishments set out in the subsection and which deals specifically with how detention and imprisonment are to relate to one another. Particularly when these provisions are taken into account, it is hard to see how, in reality, there is likely to be any scope for the reviewing authority to exercise the kind of discretion that appears to have troubled the European Court. In truth, counsel could refer to no case where any problem as to the relative severity of two punishments had arisen. If, by chance, however, the reviewing authority were to go wrong on the point, the person affected could ask the appeal court for leave to appeal. In all the cases under appeal except [one], the reviewing authority did not intervene, but the appellants were granted leave to appeal to the []. Where they had other arguable grounds of appeal relating to conviction or sentence, the [] dealt with them, as well as with the Article 6 grounds, in their reasoned judgments. In these circumstances I am, with due respect to the decision of the European Court in Morris v .the United Kingdom, unable to see why the mere existence of the reviewing authority, or the reduction of [a] period of detention [in one case], should lead to the conclusion that the determination of the charges against the appellants was not reached by a 'tribunal' that was 'independent and impartial' for the purposes of Article 6. I would therefore reject the appellants' Article 6 argument based on the role of the reviewing authority.” 77.In 2002 the rate of acquittals in contested RAF courts-martial was 52%. The rate of acquittals in contested Crown Court trials has been: Year ending in March 1999: 42.8% Year ending in March 2000: 42.8% Year ending in March 2001: 44.3% Year ending in March 2002: 42% Year ending in December 2002: 37.4%",2003,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE WERE SUFFICIENT SAFEGUARDS OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE ORDINARY MEMBERS OF THE APPLICANT'S COURT-MARTIAL.
(D)  THE REVIEWING AUTHORITY
127.  THE GOVERNMENT CONTESTED THE FINDING IN MORRIS ON THE ROLE OF THE REVIEWING AUTHORITY: THEY EMPHASISED THAT SUCH A REVIEW COULD ONLY OPERATE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE CONVICTED PERSON AND THAT THAT PERSON WOULD RETAIN FULL ACCESS TO THE  THEREAFTER. THE APPLICANT RELIED ON BRUMĂRESCU,  (P. 282, §§ 77 AND 79) AND MORRIS (§§ 73-77), CITED ABOVE. HE POINTED OUT THAT, IN ANY EVENT, SUCH REVIEWS DID NOT ALWAYS OPERATE IN FAVOUR OF THE ACCUSED.
128.  IN THE COURT'S OPINION, THE JUDGMENTS IN VAN DE HURK V. THE NETHERLANDS (19 APRIL 1994, SERIES A NO. 288, P. 16, § 45, AND P. 17, § 50) AND FINDLAY (P. 282, § 77, AND P. 276, § 52) MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT IS THE POWER OF A NON-JUDICIAL AUTHORITY TO INTERFERE WITH THE FINDINGS OF A COURT-MARTIAL FOR WHICH THE 1996 ACT PROVIDES WHICH IS TO BE EXAMINED BY THIS COURT, IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THAT POWER WAS IN FACT USED OR WHETHER THAT POWER COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN EXERCISED IN THE APPLICANT'S FAVOUR.
129.  IN THE POST-1996 SYSTEM UNDER REVIEW IN THE PRESENT CASE, A COURT-MARTIAL REACHED A VERDICT AND DECIDED ON SENTENCE. WHETHER OR NOT AN INDIVIDUAL APPLIED TO THE REVIEWING AUTHORITY, THE LATTER WOULD AUTOMATICALLY REVIEW BOTH THE VERDICT AND SENTENCE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE INDIVIDUAL COULD APPEAL AGAINST THE VERDICT AND SENTENCE TO THE . CONSEQUENTLY, THE REVIEWING AUTHORITY FORMED PART OF A PROCESS AT THE END OF WHICH THE VERDICT AND SENTENCE BECAME FINAL. THE COURT THEREFORE AGREES WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT THIS CAN BE CONTRASTED WITH THE POSITION IN BRUMĂRESCU, WHERE THE APPLICANT HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE BENEFIT OF THE LEGAL CERTAINTY OF A JUDICIAL DECISION WHICH HAD ALREADY BECOME FINAL, IRREVERSIBLE AND THUS RES JUDICATA.
130.  THE COURT FURTHER CONSIDERS, AS DID LORDS BINGHAM AND RODGER IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS, THAT THE REVIEWING AUTHORITY IS AN ANOMALOUS FEATURE OF THE PRESENT COURT-MARTIAL SYSTEM AND EXPRESSES ITS CONCERN ABOUT A CRIMINAL PROCEDURE WHICH EMPOWERS A NON-JUDICIAL AUTHORITY TO INTERFERE WITH JUDICIAL FINDINGS.
131.  NEVERTHELESS, THE COURT NOTES THAT THE FINAL DECISION IN COURT-MARTIAL PROCEEDINGS WILL ALWAYS LIE WITH A JUDICIAL AUTHORITY, NAMELY THE . THIS IS THE CASE EVEN IF A REVIEWING AUTHORITY QUASHES A VERDICT AND AUTHORISES A RETRIAL: EVEN IF THE PROSECUTING AUTHORITY WERE TO DECIDE TO BRING A FRESH PROSECUTION AND EVEN IF A COURT-MARTIAL WERE TO REFUSE TO STAY THOSE FURTHER PROCEEDINGS AS AN ABUSE OF PROCESS, THE FINAL REVIEW OF ANY NEW CONVICTION AND SENTENCE WOULD REMAIN WITH THE COURTS-MARTIAL APPEAL COURT.
IN VAN DE HURK, CITED ABOVE, THE COURT DID NOT EXCLUDE THAT THE CROWN'S POWER TO DEPRIVE A COURT'S JUDGMENT PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY OF ITS EFFECT COULD HAVE BEEN REMEDIED BY A SUBSEQUENT REVIEW BY A JUDICIAL BODY THAT AFFORDED ALL THE GUARANTEES REQUIRED BY ARTICLE 6, ALTHOUGH NO SUCH REVIEW WAS FOUND TO EXIST IN THAT CASE. THE APPEAL TO THE  WAS NOT CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT IN , SINCE THE APPLICANT HAD PLEADED GUILTY AT FIRST INSTANCE AND NO APPEAL LAY AGAINST SENTENCE ONLY TO THE .
132.  THE COURT REGARDS AS UNSUBSTANTIATED THE APPLICANT'S ASSERTION THAT COURTS-MARTIAL ADJUST SENTENCES UPWARDS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE REVIEWING AUTHORITY'S ASSESSMENT. MOREOVER, IT DOES NOT CONSIDER PERSUASIVE HIS SUBMISSION THAT THE  WOULD BE UNDULY INFLUENCED BY THE DECISION OF THE REVIEWING AUTHORITY: THE ESSENTIAL FACT IS THAT THE  IS NOT IN ANY WAY BOUND BY THE ADVICE TO, OR THE DECISION OF, THE REVIEWING AUTHORITY. INDEED, ONE OF THE DOMESTIC CASES ON WHICH THE APPLICANT RELIED (R. V. BALL AND R . V. RUGG, CITED ABOVE) RESULTED IN THE  OVERTURNING THE FINDING ON SENTENCE OF THE REVIEWING AUTHORITY.
133.  ACCORDINGLY, THE COURT FINDS THAT THE ROLE OF THE REVIEWING AUTHORITY DID NOT, IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PRESENT CASE, BREACH THE PRINCIPLE OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH 106 ABOVE AND, IN PARTICULAR, DID NOT UNDERMINE THE INDEPENDENCE OR IMPARTIALITY OF THE APPLICANT'S COURT-MARTIAL.
(E)  CONCLUSION
134.  IN ALL OF THE ABOVE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COURT CONCLUDES THAT THE APPLICANT'S MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY OF HIS COURT-MARTIAL, CONVENED UNDER THE 1996 ACT, WERE NOT OBJECTIVELY JUSTIFIED AND THAT THE COURT-MARTIAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT CONSEQUENTLY BE SAID TO HAVE BEEN UNFAIR.
THERE HAS THEREFORE BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION.
FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY
1.  DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE;
2.  HOLDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION.

82,001-58280,Grand Chamber,"8.The applicant is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1957 and lives in Istanbul.>At the material time, the applicant was the major shareholder in Deniz Basın Yayın Sanayi ve Ticaret Organizasyon, a Turkish limited liability company which owns a weekly review entitled Haberde Yorumda Gerçek (“The Truth of News and Comments”), published in Istanbul. 10.The issue dated 26 April 1992 contained a news report providing information given at a press conference by a delegation - which included two former Turkish parliamentarians Leyla Zana and Orhan Doğan, Lord Avebury and a member of the Anglican Church - on its visit to Şırnak village, in the wake of tensions in the area. The news report included an article reporting the Governor of Şırnak as having told the delegation that the Şırnak Chief of Police had given an order to open fire on the people. It further rendered a dialogue between Leyla Zana, Orhan Doğan and İsmet Yediyıldız, a Gendarme Commander. The relevant part of the report read: “Gendarmerie Regiment Commander İsmet Yediyıldız: ‘Your blood would not quench my thirst…’ While the British delegation and Diyarbakır MP Leyla Zana, Şırnak MP Orhan Doğan and Bismil District Governor Mehmet Kurdoğlu managed to persuade the people of Tepe village, which was blockaded by the security forces, after talking to them for a while and telling them that permission had been obtained for them to get the bodies of their dead, an interesting conversation took place between DiyarbakırSecurity Director Ramazan Er and Gendarmerie Regiment CommanderİsmetYediyıldız. The conversation between the MPs Leyla Zana and Orhan Doğan on the one hand and Colonel İsmet Yediyıldız on the other hand was recounted by Leyla Zana as follows: Colonel Yediyıldız: What business do you have here? There had been nobody here until you arrived. You have come and stirred things up again. Leyla Zana: No, Sir. The situation had been extremely tense before we arrived. We have come with the District Governor and are trying to calm down the tension here. Here is the District Governor. Colonel Yediyıldız: No, that’s not true. We saw when we were flying by helicopter that there was nobody here before. People gathered when you arrived. Orhan Doğan: No, you can ask the District Governor if you like. (Meanwhile, District Governor Mehmet Kurdoğlu was also being told off.) Colonel Yediyıldız: Do you know who these dead people are? Orhan Doğan: Yes, they are our children, the children of all of us. Colonel Yediyıldız: No, these are not our children, they are your children. Orhan Doğan: But my Colonel ... Colonel Yediyıldız: Do not call me your colonel. I am not your colonel. Your blood would not quench my thirst. You should also be honest and freely admit that my blood would not quench your thirst. Right now I could kill you like a rat. Your death would give us pleasure. Your blood would not quench my thirst. Leyla Zana: If the problem can be solved by killing us, then here are our people; let’s go among them and you kill us and this problem is solved. Colonel Yediyıldız: No, I would not kill you now. I would kill you after disgracing you in the eyes of the people.” 11.On 29 May 1992 the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court (İstanbul Devlet Güvenlik Mahkemesi) charged the applicant, being the owner of the review, with revealing the identity of officials mandated to fight terrorism and thus rendering them terrorist targets. The charges were brought under section 6 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (""the 1991 Act""; see paragraph 16 below). 12.In the proceedings before the Istanbul National Security Court the applicant denied the charges and advanced the following arguments in his defence. The news report had been published with the aim of informing the public of the events which had occurred during the 1992 Newroz celebrations. It had been based on a joint press declaration by former deputies Leyla Zana and Orhan Doğan and an English delegation, during their visit to south-east Turkey. By virtue of the fact that section 6 of the 1991 Act contained an absolute prohibition on the disclosure and dissemination of the identity of officials appointed to fight terrorism, it enabled officials to abuse their authority, violate the law and subject citizens to ill-treatment. The right to receive and impart information, including information concerning acts of officials, was fundamental in a democratic society. Section 6 of the 1991 Act contravened not only the Turkish Constitution but also Article 10 of the Convention. 13.In a judgment of 2 September 1993 the National Security Court convicted the applicant under section 6 of the 1991 Act and sentenced him to pay a fine of 54,000,000 Turkish lira. It noted that the news report had contained an allegation to the effect that the Governor of Şırnak had stated to the visiting delegation that the Şırnak Chief of Police had given an order to open fire on the people. It had further affirmed that a gendarme commander had stated to Orhan Doğan in Leyla Zana’s presence ""[y]our death would give us pleasure. Your blood would not quench my thirst"". By having disclosed the identity of these officials, the publication had rendered them targets for terrorist attack. 14.The applicant appealed, reiterating his defence before the National Security Court. He also argued that the press declaration at issue had already been reported in other newspapers and magazines and that the incriminated news report had added nothing to these. 15.On 10 December 1993 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal. It upheld the cogency of the National Security Court's assessment of the evidence and its reasoning for rejecting the applicant's defence. 16.The relevant provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 read as follows: Section 6 “It shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to announce, orally or in the form of a publication, that terrorist organisations will commit an offence against a specific person, whether or not that person’s ... identity is divulged, provided that it is done in such a manner that he or she may be identified, or to reveal the identity of civil servants who have participated in anti-terrorist operations or to designate any person as a target. It shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to print or publish declarations or leaflets emanating from terrorist organisations. … Where the offences contemplated in the above paragraphs are committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the sales of the previous issue if the periodical appears monthly or less frequently, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched.2 However, the fine may not be less than fifty million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher.” 17.The relevant provisions of domestic law governing the organisation and procedure of the National Security Court are quoted in paragraphs3233 of the Sürek no. 1 v. Turkey judgment, which is being delivered on the same date as the present judgment.",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1.
55.  THE APPLICANT CLAIMED COMPENSATION FOR PECUNIARY AND NONPECUNIARY DAMAGE AS WELL AS REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE DOMESTIC AND CONVENTION PROCEEDINGS. ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION  PROVIDES:
“IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION OR THE PROTOCOLS THERETO, AND IF THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTY CONCERNED ALLOWS ONLY PARTIAL REPARATION TO BE MADE, THE COURT SHALL, IF NECESSARY, AFFORD JUST SATISFACTION TO THE INJURED PARTY.”
A.	PECUNIARY DAMAGE
56.  THE APPLICANT CLAIMED THE SUM OF 100, 000 FRENCH FRANCS (FRF) BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR THE FINE IMPOSED ON HIM AND PAID (SEE PARAGRAPH 13 ABOVE). THE AMOUNT CLAIMED INCLUDED INTEREST ACCRUED, TOOK ACCOUNT OF THE HIGH RATE OF INFLATION IN THE RESPONDENT STATE AND WAS CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF AN EXCHANGE RATE FROM 1992.
57.  THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THAT THE SUM CLAIMED BY THE APPLICANT WAS EXORBITANT HAVING REGARD TO THE FACT THAT THE APPLICANT WAS ONLY FINED 54,000,000 TURKISH LIRAS AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO PAY THE FINE IN MONTHLY INSTALMENTS.
58.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT COMMENT.
59.  THE COURT CANNOT SPECULATE AS TO WHAT THE OUTCOME OF PROCEEDINGS COMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE 6 § 1 WOULD HAVE BEEN, BUT HAS FOUND THAT THE RESPONDENT STATE IS IN BREACH OF ARTICLE 10 ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPLICANT’S CONVICTION AND SENTENCE. HAVING REGARD TO THE RATES OF EXCHANGE DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, IT CONSIDERS THAT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE APPLICANT SHOULD BE AWARDED FRF 13,000 IN RESPECT OF PECUNIARY DAMAGE.
B.	NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE
60.  THE APPLICANT CLAIMED THAT AS A LAWYER HIS CAREER HAD BEEN BLIGHTED ON ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT HE HAS A CONVICTION RECORDED AGAINST HIM FOR AN OFFENCE OF TERRORISM. HE REQUESTED THE COURT TO AWARD HIM THE SUM OF FRF 80,000 BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR MORAL DAMAGE.
61.  THE GOVERNMENT ARGUED THAT IF THE COURT WERE MINDED TO FIND A VIOLATION IN THIS CASE THAT FINDING WOULD CONSTITUTE IN ITSELF SUFFICIENT JUST SATISFACTION UNDER THIS HEAD.
62.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT COMMENT ON THIS LIMB OF THE APPLICANT’S CLAIM EITHER.
63.  THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THE APPLICANT MAY BE TAKEN TO HAVE SUFFERED DISTRESS ON ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE. MAKING AN ASSESSMENT ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS, AS REQUIRED BY ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION, THE COURT AWARDS THE APPLICANT IN COMPENSATION THE SUM OF FRF 30,000 UNDER THIS HEAD.
C.	COSTS AND EXPENSES
64.  THE APPLICANT CLAIMED THE LEGAL COSTS AND EXPENSES (TRANSLATION, POSTAL, COMMUNICATIONS AND TRAVEL EXPENDITURE) WHICH HE INCURRED IN THE PROCEEDING BEFORE THE DOMESTIC COURTS AND THE CONVENTION INSTITUTIONS. HE 
ASSESSED THESE AT 50,000 FRF. AS TO THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION AND COURT HE STATED THAT HIS LAWYER’S FEES WERE BASED ON THE TURKISH BAR ASSOCIATION’S MINIMUM RATE SCALES. THE APPLICANT ADDED THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT CLAIMED TOOK ACCOUNT OF THE HIGH LEVEL OF INFLATION IN TURKEY AND WAS BASED ON CURRENT EXCHANGE RATES.
65.  THE GOVERNMENT STATED THAT THE AMOUNT CLAIMED WAS EXAGGERATED IN COMPARISON WITH FEES EARNED BY TURKISH LAWYERS IN THE DOMESTIC COURTS AND HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY JUSTIFIED. THE CASE WAS SIMPLE AND HAD NOT REQUIRED MUCH EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE APPLICANT’S LAWYER WHO HAD DEALT WITH IT THROUGHOUT THE PROCEEDINGS IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE. THEY CAUTIONED AGAINST THE MAKING OF AN AWARD WHICH WOULD ONLY CONSTITUTE A SOURCE OF UNJUST ENRICHMENT HAVING REGARD TO THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THE RESPONDENT STATE.
66.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT COMMENT.
67.  THE COURT NOTES THAT THE APPLICANT’S LAWYER HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION OF OTHER CASES BEFORE THE COURT CONCERNING COMPLAINTS UNDER ARTICLES 6 AND 10 OF THE CONVENTION WHICH ARE BASED ON SIMILAR FACTS. DECIDING ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS AND ACCORDING TO THE CRITERIA LAID DOWN IN ITS CASE-LAW (SEE, AMONG MANY OTHER AUTHORITIES, THE ABOVE-MENTIONED NIKOLOVA V. BULGARIA JUDGMENT REPORTS 1999-... P. …, § 79), THE COURT AWARDS THE APPLICANT THE SUM OF FRF 15,000.

68.  THE COURT DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE TO ADOPT THE STATUTORY RATE OF INTEREST APPLICABLE IN FRANCE AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF THE PRESENT JUDGMENT WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO IT, IS 3.47 % PER ANNUM.
FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT
1.	HOLDS BY SIXTEEN VOTES TO ONE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION;
2.	DISMISSES UNANIMOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT'S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION CONCERNING THE EXHAUSTION OF DOMESTIC REMEDIES IN RELATION TO THE APPLICANT’S COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION;
3.	HOLDS BY SIXTEEN VOTES TO ONE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION;

121,001-59454,Grand Chamber,"13.The complaints raised in this application arise out of the Turkish military operations in northern Cyprus in July and August 1974 and the continuing division of the . At the time of the Court's consideration of the merits of the Loizidou v. case in 1996, the Turkish military presence at the material time was described in the following terms (Loizidou v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996 (merits), Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, p. 2223, §§ 16-17): “16.Turkish armed forces of more than 30,000 personnel are stationed throughout the whole of the occupied area of northern , which is constantly patrolled and has checkpoints on all main lines of communication. The army's headquarters are in Kyrenia. The 28th Infantry Division is based in Asha (Assia) with its sector covering Famagusta to the Mia Milia suburb of and with about 14,500 personnel. The 39th Infantry Division, with about 15,500 personnel, is based at Myrtou village, and its sector ranges from Yerolakkos village to Lefka. TOURDYK (Turkish Forces in Cyprus under the Treaty of Guarantee) is stationed at Orta Keuy village near Nicosia, with a sector running from Nicosia International Airport to the . A Turkish naval command and outpost are based at and Kyrenia respectively. Turkish airforce personnel are based at Lefkoniko, Krini and other airfields. The Turkish airforce is stationed on the Turkish mainland at . 17.The Turkish forces and all civilians entering military areas are subject to Turkish military courts, as stipulated so far as concerns 'TRNC citizens' by the Prohibited Military Areas Decree of 1979 (section 9) and Article 156 of the Constitution of the 'TRNC'.” 14.A major development in the continuing division of Cyprus occurred in November 1983 with the proclamation of the “Turkish Republic of Northern ” (the “TRNC”) and the subsequent enactment of the “TRNC Constitution” on 7 May 1985. This development was condemned by the international community. On 18 November 1983 the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution541 (1983) declaring the proclamation of the establishment of the “TRNC” legally invalid and calling upon all States not to recognise any Cypriot State other than the Republic of Cyprus. A similar call was made by the Security Council on 11 May 1984 in its Resolution 550 (1984). In November 1983 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe decided that it continued to regard the government of the Republic of Cyprus as the sole legitimate government of Cyprus and called for respect of the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of the . 15.According to the respondent Government, the “TRNC” is a democratic and constitutional State which is politically independent of all other sovereign States including Turkey, and the administration in northern Cyprus has been set up by the Turkish-Cypriot people in the exercise of its right to self-determination and not by . Notwithstanding this view, it is only the Cypriot government which is recognised internationally as the government of the in the context of diplomatic and treaty relations and the working of international organisations. 16.United Nations peacekeeping forces (“UNFICYP”) maintain a buffer-zone. A number of political initiatives have been taken at the level of the United Nations aimed at settling the problem on the basis of institutional arrangements acceptable to both sides. To this end, inter-communal talks have been sponsored by the Secretary-General of the United Nations acting under the direction of the Security Council. In this connection, the respondent Government maintain that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities in northern have pursued the talks on the basis of what they consider to be already agreed principles of bi-zonality and bi-communality within the framework of a federal constitution. Support for this basis of negotiation is found in the UN Secretary-General's Set of Ideas of 15 July 1992 and the UN Security Council resolutions of 26 August 1992 and 25 November 1992 confirming that a federal solution sought by both sides will be “bi-communal” and “bi-zonal”. Furthermore, and of relevance to the instant application, in 1981 the United Nations Committee on Missing Persons (“CMP”) was set up to “look into cases of persons reported missing in the inter-communal fighting as well as in the events of July 1974 and afterwards” and “to draw up comprehensive lists of missing persons of both communities, specifying as appropriate whether they are still alive or dead, and in the latter case approximate times of death”. The CMP has not yet completed its investigations. 17.The events of July and August 1974 and their aftermath gave rise to three previous applications by the applicant Government against the respondent State under former Article 24 of the Convention. The first (no.6780/74) and second (no. 6950/75) applications were joined by the Commission and led to the adoption on 10 July 1976 of a report under former Article 31 of the Convention (“the 1976 report”) in which the Commission expressed the opinion that the respondent State had violated Articles 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. On 20 January 1979 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in turn adopted, with reference to an earlier decision of 21 October 1977, Resolution DH (79) 1 in which it expressed, inter alia, the conviction that “the enduring protection of human rights in Cyprus can only be brought about through the re-establishment of peace and confidence between the two communities; and that inter-communal talks constitute the appropriate framework for reaching a solution of the dispute”. In its resolution the Committee of Ministers strongly urged the parties to resume the talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in order to agree upon solutions on all aspects of the dispute (see paragraph 16 above). The Committee of Ministers viewed this decision as completing its consideration of the case. The third application (no. 8007/77) lodged by the applicant Government was the subject of a further report under former Article 31 adopted by the Commission on 4 October 1983 (“the 1983 report”). In that report the Commission expressed the opinion that the respondent State was in breach of its obligations under Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. On 2 April 1992 the Committee of Ministers adopted Resolution DH (92) 12 in respect of the Commission's 1983 report. In its resolution the Committee of Ministers limited itself to a decision to make the 1983 report public and stated that its consideration of the case was thereby completed. 18.The instant application is the first to have been referred to the Court. The applicant Government requested the Court in their memorial to “decide and declare that the respondent State is responsible for continuing violations and other violations of Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17 and 18 of the Convention and of Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No. 1”. These allegations were invoked with reference to four broad categories of complaints: alleged violations of the rights of Greek-Cypriot missing persons and their relatives; alleged violations of the home and property rights of displaced persons; alleged violations of the rights of enclaved Greek Cypriots in northern Cyprus; alleged violations of the rights of Turkish Cypriots and the Gypsy community in northern Cyprus. 19.The Court considers it appropriate at this stage to summarise the Commission's findings of fact in respect of the various violations of the Convention alleged by the applicant Government as well as the essential arguments advanced by both parties and the documentary and other evidence relied on by the Commission. 20.The applicant Government essentially claimed in their application that about 1,491 Greek Cypriots were still missing twenty years after the cessation of hostilities. These persons were last seen alive in Turkish custody and their fate has never been accounted for by the respondent State. 21.The respondent Government maintained in reply that there was no proof that any of the missing persons were still alive or were being kept in custody. In their principal submission, the issues raised by the applicant Government should continue to be pursued within the framework of the United Nations Committee on Missing Persons (see paragraph 16 above) rather than under the Convention. 22.The Commission proceeded on the understanding that its task was not to establish what actually happened to the Greek-Cypriot persons who went missing following the Turkish military operations conducted in northern in July and August 1974. Rather, it saw its task as one of determining whether or not the alleged failure of the respondent State to clarify the facts surrounding the disappearances constituted a continuing violation of the Convention. 23.To that end, the Commission had particular regard to its earlier findings in its 1976 and 1983 reports. It recalled that in its 1976 report it had stated that it was widely accepted that a considerable number of Cypriots were still missing as a result of armed conflict in Cyprus and that a number of persons declared to be missing were identified as Greek Cypriots taken prisoner by the Turkish army. This finding, in the Commission's opinion at the time, created a presumption of Turkish responsibility for the fate of persons shown to be in Turkish custody. While noting that killings of Greek-Cypriot civilians had occurred on a large scale, the Commission also considered at the time of its 1976 report that it was unable to ascertain whether, and under what circumstances, Greek-Cypriot prisoners declared to be missing had been deprived of their life. 24.In the present case, the Commission further recalled that in its 1983 report it found it established that there were sufficient indications in an indefinite number of cases that missing Greek Cypriots had been in Turkish custody in 1974 and that this finding once again created a presumption of Turkish responsibility for the fate of these persons. 25.The Commission found that the evidence submitted to it in the instant case confirmed its earlier findings that certain of the missing persons were last seen in Turkish or Turkish-Cypriot custody. In this connection, the Commission had regard to the following: a statement of Mr Denktaş, “President of the TRNC”, broadcast on 1 March 1996, in which he admitted that forty-two Greek-Cypriot prisoners were handed over to Turkish-Cypriot fighters who killed them and that in order to prevent further such killings prisoners were subsequently transferred to Turkey; the broadcast statement of Professor Yalçin Küçük, a former Turkish officer who had served in the Turkish army at the time and participated in the 1974 military operation in Cyprus, in which he suggested that the Turkish army had engaged in widespread killings of, inter alia, civilians in so-called cleaning-up operations; the Dillon Report submitted to the United States Congress in May 1998 indicating, inter alia, that Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot soldiers rounded up Greek-Cypriot civilians in the village of Asha on 18 August 1974 and took away males over the age of 15, most of whom were reportedly killed by Turkish-Cypriot fighters; the written statements of witnesses tending to corroborate the Commission's earlier findings that many persons now missing were taken into custody by Turkish soldiers or Turkish-Cypriot paramilitaries. 26.The Commission concluded that, notwithstanding evidence of the killing of Greek-Cypriot prisoners and civilians, there was no proof that any of the missing persons were killed in circumstances for which the respondent State could be held responsible; nor did the Commission find any evidence to the effect that any of the persons taken into custody were still being detained or kept in servitude by the respondent State. On the other hand, the Commission found it established that the facts surrounding the fate of the missing persons had not been clarified by the authorities and brought to the notice of the victims' relatives. 27.The Commission further concluded that its examination of the applicant Government's complaints in the instant application was not precluded by the ongoing work of the CMP. It noted in this connection that the scope of the investigation being conducted by the CMP was limited to determining whether or not any of the missing persons on its list were dead or alive; nor was the CMP empowered to make findings either on the cause of death or on the issue of responsibility for any deaths so established. Furthermore, the territorial jurisdiction of the CMP was limited to the island of Cyprus, thus excluding investigations in where some of the disappearances were claimed to have occurred. The Commission also observed that persons who might be responsible for violations of the Convention were promised impunity and that it was doubtful whether the CMP's investigation could extend to actions by the Turkish army or Turkish officials on Cypriot territory. 28.The Commission established the facts under this heading against the background of the applicant Government's principal submission that over 211,000 displaced Greek Cypriots and their children continued to be prevented as a matter of policy from returning to their homes in northern and from having access to their property there for any purpose. The applicant Government submitted that the presence of the Turkish army together with “TRNC”-imposed border restrictions ensured that the return of displaced persons was rendered physically impossible and, as a corollary, that their cross-border family visits were gravely impeded. What started as a gradual and continuing process of illegality over the years had now resulted in the transfer of the property left behind by the displaced persons to the “TRNC” authorities without payment of compensation and its re-assignment, together with “title deeds”, to State bodies, Turkish Cypriots and settlers from . 29.The respondent Government maintained before the Commission that the question of the Varosha district of Famagusta along with the issues of freedom of movement, freedom of settlement and the right of property could only be resolved within the framework of the inter-communal talks (see paragraph 16 above) and on the basis of the principles agreed on by both sides for the conduct of the talks. Until an overall solution to the question, acceptable to both sides, was found, and having regard to security considerations, there could be no question of a right of the displaced persons to return. The respondent Government further submitted that the regulation of property abandoned by displaced persons, as with restrictions on cross-border movement, fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the “TRNC” authorities. 30.The Commission found that it was common knowledge that with the exception of a few hundred Maronites living in the Kormakiti area and Greek Cypriots living in the Karpas peninsula, the whole Greek-Cypriot population which before 1974 resided in the northern part of Cyprus had left that area, the large majority of these people now living in southern . The reality of this situation was not contested by the respondent Government. 31.The Commission noted with reference to its earlier findings in its 1976 and 1983 reports that there was no essential change in the situation obtaining at the time of the introduction of the instant application. Accordingly, and this was not disputed either by the respondent Government, displaced Greek Cypriots had no possibility of returning to their homes in northern Cyprus and were physically prevented from crossing into the northern part on account of the fact that it was sealed off by the Turkish army. The arrangements introduced by the “TRNC” authorities in 1998 to allow Greek Cypriots and Maronites to cross into northern for the purposes of family visits or, as regards Greek Cypriots, visits to the Apostolos Andreas Monastery, did not affect this conclusion. 32.Nor did the respondent Government dispute the fact that Greek-Cypriot owners of property in northern continued to be prevented from having access to, controlling, using and enjoying their property. As to the fate of that property, the Commission found it established that up until 1989 there was an administrative practice of the Turkish-Cypriot authorities to leave the official Land Register unaffected and to register separately the “abandoned” property and its allocation. The beneficiaries of allocations were issued with “possessory certificates” but not “deeds of title” to the properties concerned. However, as from June 1989 the practice changed and thereafter “title deeds” were issued and the relevant entries concerning the change of ownership were made in the Land Register. The Commission found it established that, at least since June 1989, the Turkish-Cypriot authorities no longer recognised any ownership rights of Greek Cypriots in respect of their properties in northern . The Commission found confirmation for this finding in the provisions of “Article 159 § 1 (b) of the TRNC Constitution” of 7 May 1985 and “Law no. 52/1995” purporting to give effect to that provision. 33.Although the respondent Government pointed out in their submissions to the Commission that the issue of the right of displaced Greek Cypriots to return to their homes was a matter to be determined within the framework of the inter-communal talks sponsored by the Secretary-General of the United Nations (see paragraph 16 above), the Commission found that there had been no significant progress in recent years in the discussion of issues such as freedom of settlement, payment of compensation to Greek Cypriots for the interference with their property rights, or restitution of Greek-Cypriot property in the Varosha district. 34.The applicant Government adduced evidence in support of their complaint that the dwindling number of Greek Cypriots living in the Karpas peninsula of northern Cyprus were subjected to continuing oppressive treatment which amounted to a complete denial of their rights and a negation of their human dignity. In addition to the harassment and intimidation which they suffered at the hands of Turkish settlers, and which has gone unpunished, the enclaved Greek Cypriots laboured under restrictions which violated many of the substantive rights contained in the Convention. The continuous daily interferences with their rights could not be redressed at the local level on account of the absence of effective remedies before the “TRNC” courts. Similar but less extensive restrictions applied to the Maronite population living in the Kormakiti area of northern . 35.The respondent Government maintained before the Commission that effective judicial remedies were available to all Greek Cypriots living in northern . However, they claimed that the applicant Government actively discouraged them from taking proceedings in the “TRNC”. The respondent Government further submitted that the evidence before the Commission did not provide any basis of fact for the allegations made. 36.The Commission established the facts under this heading with reference to materials submitted by both Governments. These materials included, inter alia, written statements of persons affected by the restrictions alleged by the applicant Government; press reports dealing with the situation in northern Cyprus; case-law of the “TRNC” courts on the availability of remedies in the “TRNC”; “TRNC legislation” and decisions of the “TRNC Council of Ministers” on entry and exit arrangements at the check-point. The Commission also had regard to United Nations documents concerning the living conditions of enclaved Greek Cypriots and especially to the UN Secretary-General's progress reports of 10 December 1995 and 9 March 1998 on the humanitarian review carried out by UNFICYP in 1994-95 concerning the living conditions of Karpas Greek Cypriots, the so-called “Karpas Brief”. 37.Furthermore, the Commission's delegates heard the evidence of fourteen witnesses on the situation of Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in northern . These witnesses comprised two persons who were closely associated with the preparation of the “Karpas Brief” as well as persons proposed by both Governments. The delegates also visited, on 23 and 24 February 1998, a number of localities in northern , including Greek-Cypriot villages in the Karpas area, and heard statements from officials and other persons encountered during the visits. 38.The Commission considered the above-mentioned “Karpas Brief” an accurate description of the situation of the enclaved Greek-Cypriot and Maronite populations at about the time of the introduction of the instant application and that the proposals for remedial action recommended by UNFICYP following the humanitarian review reflected the real needs of these groups in the face of administrative practices which actually existed at the material time. Although the Commission noted that there had been a considerable improvement in the overall situation of the enclaved populations, as evidenced by the UN Secretary-General's progress reports on the “Karpas Brief” recommendations, there still remained a number of severe restrictions. These restrictions were not laid down in any “TRNC legislation” and were in the nature of administrative practices. 39.The Commission further found that there existed a functioning court system in the “TRNC” which was in principle accessible to Greek Cypriots living in northern . It appeared that at least in cases of trespass to property or personal injury there had been some successful actions brought by Greek-Cypriot litigants before the civil and criminal courts. However, in view of the scarcity of cases brought by Greek Cypriots, the Commission was led to conclude that the effectiveness of the judicial system for resident Greek Cypriots had not really been tested. 40.In a further conclusion, the Commission found that there was no evidence of continuing wrongful allocation of properties of resident Greek Cypriots to other persons during the period under consideration. However, the Commission did find it established that there was a continuing practice of the “TRNC” authorities to allocate to Turkish-Cypriots or immigrants the property of Greek Cypriots who had died or left northern . 41.In the absence of legal proceedings before the “TRNC” courts, the Commission noted that it had not been tested whether or not Greek Cypriots or Maronites living in northern were in fact considered as citizens enjoying the protection of the “TRNC Constitution”. It did however find it established that, in so far as the groups at issue complained of administrative practices such as restrictions on their freedom of movement or on family visits which were based on decisions of the “TRNC Council of Ministers”, any legal challenge to these restrictions would be futile given that such decisions were not open to review by the courts. 42.Although the Commission found no evidence of cases of actual detention of members of the enclaved population, it was satisfied that there was clear evidence that restrictions on movement and family visits continued to be applied to Greek Cypriots and Maronites notwithstanding recent improvements. It further observed that an exit visa was still necessary for transfers to medical facilities in the south, although no fees were levied in urgent cases. There was no evidence to confirm the allegation that the processing of applications for movement was delayed in certain cases with the result that the health or life of patients was endangered; nor was there any indication of a deliberate practice of delaying the processing of such applications. 43.The Commission found it established that there were restrictions on the freedom of movement of Greek-Cypriot and Maronite schoolchildren attending schools in the south. Until the entry into force of the decision of the “TRNC Council of Ministers” of 11 February 1998, they were not allowed to return permanently to the north after having attained the age of 16 in the case of males and 18 in the case of females. The age-limit of 16years was still maintained for Greek-Cypriot male students. Up to the age-limit, certain restrictions applied to the visits of students to their parents in the north, which were gradually relaxed. However, even today such visits are subject to a visa requirement and a reduced “entry fee”. 44.As to educational facilities, the Commission held that, although there was a system of primary-school education for the children of Greek Cypriots living in northern , there were no secondary schools for them. The vast majority of schoolchildren went to the south for their secondary education and the restriction on the return of Greek-Cypriot and Maronite schoolchildren to the north after the completion of their studies had led to the separation of many families. Furthermore, school textbooks for use in the Greek-Cypriot primary school were subjected to a “vetting” procedure in the context of confidence-building measures suggested by UNFICYP. The procedure was cumbersome and a relatively high number of school-books were being objected to by the Turkish-Cypriot administration. 45.Aside from school-books, the Commission found no evidence of any restrictions being applied during the period under consideration to the importation, circulation or possession of other types of books; nor was there evidence of restrictions on the circulation of newspapers published in southern . However, there was no regular distribution system for the Greek-Cypriot press in the Karpas area and no direct post and telecommunications links between the north and south of the island. It was further noted that the enclaved population was able to receive Greek-Cypriot radio and television. 46.The Commission did not find any conclusive evidence that letters destined for Greek Cypriots were opened by the “TRNC” police or that their telephones were tapped. 47.As to alleged restrictions on religious worship, the Commission found that the main problem for Greek Cypriots in this connection stemmed from the fact that there was only one priest for the whole Karpas area and that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities were not favourable to the appointment of additional priests from the south. The Commission delegates were unable to confirm during their visit to the Karpas area whether access to the Apostolos Andreas Monastery was free at any time for Karpas Greek Cypriots. It appeared to be the case that on high religious holidays (which occur three times a year) visits to the monastery are also allowed to Greek Cypriots from the south. 48.Concerning alleged restrictions on the freedom of association of the enclaved population, the Commission observed that the relevant “TRNC” law on associations only covered the creation of associations by Turkish Cypriots. 49.The applicant Government contended before the Commission that Turkish Cypriots living in northern , especially political dissidents and the Gypsy community, were the victims of an administrative practice of violation of their Convention rights. They adduced evidence in support of their claim that these groups were victims of arbitrary arrest and detention, police misconduct, discrimination and ill-treatment and interferences in various forms with other Convention rights such as, inter alia, fair trial, private and family life, expression, association, property and education. 50.The respondent Government essentially maintained that the above allegations were unsubstantiated on the evidence and pointed to the availability of effective remedies in the “TRNC” to aggrieved persons. 51.The Commission's investigation into the applicant Government's allegations was based mainly on the oral evidence of thirteen witnesses who testified before the Commission's delegates on the situation of Turkish Cypriots and the Gypsy community living in northern . The witnesses were proposed by both parties. Their evidence was taken by the delegates in Strasbourg, Cyprus and between November 1997 and April 1998. 52.The Commission found that there existed rivalry and social conflict between the original Turkish Cypriots and immigrants from who continued to arrive in considerable numbers. Some of the original Turkish Cypriots and their political groups and media resented the “TRNC” policy of full integration for the settlers. 53.Furthermore, while there was a significant incidence of emigration from the “TRNC” for economic reasons, it could not be excluded that there were also cases of Turkish Cypriots having fled the “TRNC” out of fear of political persecution. The Commission considered that there was no reason to doubt the correctness of witnesses' assertions that in a few cases complaints of harassment or discrimination by private groups of or against political opponents were not followed up by the “TRNC” police. However, it concluded that it was not established beyond reasonable doubt that there was in fact a consistent administrative practice of the “TRNC” authorities, including the courts, of refusing protection to political opponents of the ruling parties. In so far as it was alleged by the applicant Government that the authorities themselves were involved in the harassment of political opponents, the Commission did not have sufficient details concerning the incidents complained of (for example, the dispersing of demonstrations, short-term arrests) which would allow it to form an opinion as to the justification or otherwise of the impugned acts. The Commission noted that, in any event, it did not appear that the remedy of habeas corpus had been invoked by persons claiming to be victims of arbitrary arrest or detention. 54.Regarding the alleged discrimination against and arbitrary treatment of members of the Turkish-Cypriot Gypsy community, the Commission found that judicial remedies had apparently not been used in respect of particularly grave incidents such as the pulling down of shacks near Morphou and the refusal of airline companies to transport Gypsies to the United Kingdom without a visa. 55.In a further conclusion, the Commission observed that there was no evidence before it of Turkish-Cypriot civilians having been subjected to the jurisdiction of military courts during the period under consideration. Furthermore, and with respect to the evidence before it, the Commission considered that it had not been established that, during the period under consideration, there was an official prohibition on the circulation of Greek-language newspapers in northern or that the creation of bi-communal associations was prevented. In respect of the alleged refusal of the “TRNC” authorities to allow Turkish Cypriots to return to their properties in southern , the Commission observed that no concrete instances were referred to it of any persons who had wished to do so during the period under consideration.",2001,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT REJECTS THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT'S CRITICISM IN THIS RESPECT.
112.  THE COURT ALSO OBSERVES THAT IN ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE IN RELATION TO THE VARIOUS COMPLAINTS DECLARED ADMISSIBLE, THE COMMISSION APPLIED THE STANDARD OF PROOF “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” AS ENUNCIATED BY THE COURT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT OF 18 JANUARY 1978 (SERIES A NO. 25), IT BEING NOTED THAT SUCH PROOF MAY FOLLOW FROM THE COEXISTENCE OF SUFFICIENTLY STRONG, CLEAR AND CONCORDANT INFERENCES OR OF SIMILAR UNREBUTTED PRESUMPTIONS OF FACT (IBID., PP. 64-65, § 161).
113.  THE COURT, FOR ITS PART, ENDORSES THE APPLICATION OF THIS STANDARD, ALL THE MORE SO SINCE IT WAS FIRST ARTICULATED IN THE CONTEXT OF A PREVIOUS INTERSTATE CASE AND HAS, SINCE THE DATE OF THE ADOPTION OF THE JUDGMENT IN THAT CASE, BECOME PART OF THE COURT'S ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW (FOR A RECENT EXAMPLE, SEE SALMAN V. TURKEY [GC], NO. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000-VII).
MOREOVER, AS REGARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE EXISTENCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES, THE COURT DOES NOT RELY ON THE CONCEPT THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS BORNE BY ONE OR THE OTHER OF THE TWO GOVERNMENTS CONCERNED. RATHER, IT MUST EXAMINE ALL THE MATERIAL BEFORE IT, IRRESPECTIVE OF ITS ORIGIN (SEE THE ABOVE-MENTIONED IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, P. 64 § 160).
114.  THE COURT NOTES, HOWEVER, THAT THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT HAVE DISPUTED THE APPROPRIATENESS OF APPLYING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED STANDARD OF PROOF WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ALLEGATIONS THAT THE VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION OF WHICH THEY COMPLAIN RESULT FROM ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES ON THE PART OF THE RESPONDENT STATE. IN THEIR SUBMISSION, THE COMMISSION ERRED IN NOT HAVING REGARD TO THE EXISTENCE OF “SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE” OF ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES AND ITS RELIANCE ON THE “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” STANDARD PREVENTED IT FROM REACHING THE CORRECT CONCLUSION ON THE FACTS AS REGARDS A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS. FOR THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT, THE STANDARD OF PROOF APPLIED BY THE COMMISSION IS AT VARIANCE WITH THE APPROACH FOLLOWED BY THE COURT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, AN APPROACH WHICH, THEY MAINTAIN, HAD ALREADY BEEN ANTICIPATED IN THE COMMISSION'S DECISION IN THE “GREEK CASE” (YEARBOOK 12).
115.  THE COURT RECALLS HOWEVER THAT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, IT REJECTED THE IRISH GOVERNMENT'S SUBMISSION THAT THE “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” STANDARD OF PROOF WAS AN EXCESSIVELY RIGID STANDARD FOR ESTABLISHING THE EXISTENCE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE OF VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION (LOC. CIT., PP. 64-65, § 161). THE “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” STANDARD WAS APPLIED IN THAT CASE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EVIDENCE BORE OUT THE ALLEGATION OF A PRACTICE OF VIOLATION. THE COURT WILL ACCORDINGLY ASSESS THE FACTS AS FOUND BY THE COMMISSION WITH REFERENCE TO THIS STANDARD. FURTHERMORE, THE COURT WILL APPLY THE DEFINITION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CONVENTION SET OUT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, NAMELY AN ACCUMULATION OF IDENTICAL OR ANALOGOUS BREACHES WHICH ARE SUFFICIENTLY NUMEROUS AND INTER-CONNECTED TO AMOUNT NOT MERELY TO ISOLATED INCIDENTS OR EXCEPTIONS BUT TO A PATTERN OR SYSTEM (IBID., P. 64, § 159).
116.  THE COURT FURTHER RECALLS THAT, IN THE AREA OF THE EXHAUSTION OF DOMESTIC REMEDIES, THERE IS A DISTRIBUTION OF THE BURDEN OF PROOF. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INSTANT CASE, IT IS INCUMBENT ON THE RESPONDENT GOVERNMENT CLAIMING NON-EXHAUSTION TO SATISFY THE COURT THAT THE REMEDY WAS AN EFFECTIVE ONE AVAILABLE IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE AT THE RELEVANT TIME, THAT IS TO SAY, THAT IT WAS ACCESSIBLE, WAS ONE WHICH WAS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING REDRESS IN RESPECT OF THE AGGRIEVED INDIVIDUALS' COMPLAINTS AND OFFERED REASONABLE PROSPECTS OF SUCCESS. HOWEVER, ONCE THIS BURDEN OF PROOF HAS BEEN SATISFIED IT FALLS TO THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH THAT THE REMEDY ADVANCED BY THE RESPONDENT GOVERNMENT WAS IN FACT EXHAUSTED OR WAS FOR SOME REASON INADEQUATE AND INEFFECTIVE IN THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE, OR THAT THERE EXISTED SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ABSOLVING THE PERSONS CONCERNED FROM THE REQUIREMENT OF EXHAUSTING THAT REMEDY. ONE SUCH REASON MAY BE CONSTITUTED BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES REMAINING TOTALLY PASSIVE IN THE FACE OF SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT OR INFLICTION OF HARM BY STATE AGENTS, FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THEY HAVE FAILED TO UNDERTAKE INVESTIGATIONS OR OFFER ASSISTANCE. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IT CAN BE SAID THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF SHIFTS ONCE AGAIN, SO THAT IT BECOMES INCUMBENT ON THE RESPONDENT GOVERNMENT TO SHOW WHAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE "
112,001-85131,Grand Chamber,"11.In their capacity as doctors, the applicants are members of the National Health System (Εθνικό Σύστημα Υγείας) and are employed by the public hospital “O Evangelismos”. 12.On 28 April 1994 they applied to the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal seeking to have set aside the hospital's refusal to pay them an allowance for overtime work, set at 1/65th of their basic salary. The sole purpose of this application was to challenge the lawfulness of the disputed administrative decision. 13.Initially scheduled for 11 March 1996, the hearing was postponed seven times, one of these being at the applicants' request. It was eventually held on 22 November 1999. On 16 December 1999 the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal set aside the disputed administrative decision (decision no. 2684/1999). 14.On 18 April 2000 the hospital lodged an appeal against that decision. Initially scheduled for 18 January 2001, the hearing was held on 18 October 2001, after four postponements. On 7 March 2002 the Third Division of the sent the case for examination by that court's seven-judge bench on account of the importance of a question concerning the way in which the document in dispute had been published (judgment no. 763/2002). 15.On 6 February 2003, following the postponement of one hearing, the Supreme Administrative Court overturned the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal's decision. It held that the ministerial decree on which the applicants based their claim to receive an allowance for overtime work had not been published in due form and was therefore without foundation (judgment no. 307/2003). 16.It appears from the case file that, in the meantime, the applicants had on several occasions brought actions in the administrative courts, seeking payment of various amounts in respect of allowances for overtime work allegedly owed by the public hospital in question. The total sum claimed by each applicant in this connection varied between 15,000 and 20,000 euros (EUR). It appears from the case file that these actions were dismissed by the domestic courts. 17.Article 115 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Procedure provides: “Several persons may bring a joint action, in a single appeal, against the same act or omission, provided that the grounds advanced have, in substance, the same legal or factual basis with regard to the essential issues or are based on the same action. [A joint action may also be lodged] where the grounds advanced concern a shared right or where, in substance, the rights relied upon have the same legal or factual basis with regard to the key issues. ...”",2008,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

14,001-58908,Grand Chamber,"8.Nicole Van Geyseghem, a nursery nurse born in 1942, is a Belgian citizen. At the time of lodging her application, she was living in Hoeilaart (Belgium).>The applicant and four others were prosecuted for importing drugs from Brazil on three occasions between 22 June 1986 and 21 March 1987, including 2.33 kilograms of cocaine on 20 March 1987, the date on which the applicant was arrested. 10.On 10 December 1992 the Brussels Criminal Court convicted the applicant in absentia (she had failed to appear even though she had been properly served with a summons) and sentenced her to four years’ imprisonment and a fine of 180,000 Belgian francs (BEF). The court also ordered her immediate arrest on the ground that there was reason to believe that she would attempt to evade enforcement of her sentence. 11.On 26 April 1993 Mrs Van Geyseghem applied to the same court to set aside its judgment. 12.She attended the hearing of her application. On 7 May 1993 the Brussels Criminal Court, after adversarial proceedings, sentenced her to three years’ imprisonment and a fine of BEF 60,000. The court held that there was no need to order the applicant’s immediate arrest as there was no cause to fear that she would attempt to evade enforcement of her sentence. 13.On 21 May 1993 both the applicant and the prosecution appealed. 14.Although the summons to appear had been served on her in accordance with the proper procedure, Mrs Van Geyseghem did not attend the appeal hearing and neither did a lawyer on her behalf. On 14 June 1993 the Brussels Court of Appeal, ruling in the applicant’s absence, upheld the judgment of 7 May 1993 in its entirety. It also ordered the applicant’s immediate arrest on the ground that there was reason to believe that she would attempt to evade enforcement of her sentence in view of its length and of the fact that she had failed to appear both at the appeal hearing and at the original trial. 15.On 26 August 1993 the applicant applied to set aside the Court of Appeal’s judgment. Her application was served on the prosecution by means of a bailiff’s writ, in which the hearing was set down for 13September 1993. 16.The applicant did not attend the hearing in person. Her counsel, MrVerstraeten, appeared and, relying on Article 185 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 20 below), stated that he was representing his client and would be making submissions to the effect that the prosecution had become time-barred between the delivery of the Court of Appeal’s judgment in absentia and the date on which the application to set it aside was to be heard by the Court of Appeal. The court refused MrsVan Geyseghem’s counsel leave to address it and make submissions on his client’s behalf. At counsel’s request, the following was entered in the record of the hearing of 13September 1993: “The Court refuses Mr Rafael Verstraeten, of the Brussels Bar, leave to represent the appellant and to make submissions on her behalf to the effect that the prosecution is time-barred.” 17.In a judgment of 4 October 1993 the Court of Appeal declared the application void on the following grounds: “Although the application has been filed in the proper form and within the statutory time, the appellant has failed to attend the hearing on the date set by her and has not adduced any evidence of force majeure preventing her from attending in person.” 18.The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of 4 October 1993. In her pleading she argued that the Court of Appeal’s refusal to grant her counsel leave to make submissions on her behalf had infringed her defence rights and Article 185 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that the accused may appear by counsel “where the hearing concerns only an objection [or] a matter unconnected with the merits of the case …”. In written submissions of 16 March 1994 summarising his address, the applicant’s counsel referred to the European Court’s judgment in the Poitrimol v.France case (23 November 1993, Series A no. 277-A). 19.The Court of Cassation dismissed her appeal in a judgment of 4 May 1994 in the following terms: “The appellant submits that her counsel attended the hearing and that the Court of Appeal, in refusing him leave to represent her and make submissions on her behalf to the effect that the prosecution was time-barred – that is, to raise ‘an objection unconnected with the merits of the case’ – infringed Articles 185, 188 and 211 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the general principle of law which requires that the rights of the defence be respected; Where a trial or appeal court is dealing with charges which may attract a custodial sentence as the principal sentence, paragraph 2 of the above-mentioned Article 185 allows an accused to appear by counsel only ‘where the hearing concerns an objection, a matter unconnected with the merits of the case or the civil interests’; Within the meaning of that provision, a claim that an action is time-barred is neither an objection nor a matter unconnected with the merits; The ground of appeal has no basis in law.” 20.The relevant Articles of the Code of Criminal Procedure read as follows: Article 185 “1.The party claiming civil damages and the party liable to pay such damages shall attend the hearing or appear by counsel.>The accused shall attend the hearing. However, the accused may appear by counsel in the case of minor offences which do not attract a custodial sentence or where the hearing concerns an objection, a matter unconnected with the merits of the case or the civil interests. The Criminal Court may still grant leave for the accused to appear by counsel where he provides evidence that he is unable to attend.>In any event, the Criminal Court may order the accused to attend. No appeal shall lie against such a decision. The judgment in which the accused is ordered to attend shall be served on the party concerned on an application by the prosecution, together with a summons to attend on the date determined by the Criminal Court. Where the accused fails to attend, the court shall determine the matter in his absence.” Article 186 “If the accused fails to attend the hearing, he shall be tried in his absence.” Article 187 “An accused who is convicted in his absence may lodge an application to set aside the judgment within fifteen days of the date on which it was served on him.” Article 188 “An application to set aside shall automatically be effective as a summons to attend the first hearing following the expiry of fifteen days, or three days where the party lodging the application is in custody. The application shall be void if the party who lodged it fails to attend the hearing. Save as hereinafter provided, no appeal by the party who lodged the application to set aside shall lie against the Criminal Court’s ruling. Where appropriate, the court may make an interim award. Such an award shall be enforceable notwithstanding an appeal.” Article 208 “A judgment on appeal delivered in absentia may be challenged by means of an application to set aside made under the same procedure and within the same time-limits as a judgment delivered in absentia by the Criminal Court. The application shall automatically be effective as a summons to attend the first hearing following the expiry of fifteen days, or three days where the party lodging the application is in custody. The application to set aside shall be void if the party who lodged it fails to attend the hearing. No appeal by the party who lodged the application shall lie against the Court of Appeal’s ruling other than an appeal on points of law to the Court of Cassation.” Article 211 “The provisions of the preceding Articles which relate to the formalities of judicial investigations, the nature of evidence, the form, authenticity and signature of final judgments delivered at first instance, orders to pay costs and the penalties applicable under those Articles shall also apply to judgments delivered on appeal.” 21.Where an application to set aside has been declared void on the ground that the applicant failed to attend the hearing, the judgment which records the fact will itself be a judgment given in absentia. If the applicant again fails to attend the hearing, a second application by him to set aside will be inadmissible, in accordance with the maxim “opposition sur opposition ne vaut” (an application to set aside a judgment delivered in absentia on an application to set aside an earlier judgment delivered in absentia is ineffective). Were the convicted person able to lodge a further application to set aside the decision of the court which refused in absentia his application to set aside an initial decision also delivered in absentia, he could, by failing to attend and lodging one application after another, indefinitely hinder the enforcement of any conviction and thus paralyse the administration of justice.",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

159,001-96007,Grand Chamber,"8.The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in .>In the parliamentary elections of 3 November 2002, as a member of the People’s Republican Party (CHP), he was elected member of parliament (MP) for the Konya constituency to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (“the National Assembly”). 10.Prior to his election he practised as a lawyer in and, in the course of his professional activities, two sets of criminal proceedings were brought against him, one for insulting a lawyer and the other for insulting a public official. 11.Once elected as an MP he enjoyed parliamentary immunity. 12.On 23 December 2002 the Karapınar public prosecutor applied to the General Directorate of the Ministry of Justice to have the applicant’s parliamentary immunity lifted for the purposes of the criminal proceedings against him for insulting a lawyer. 13.On 17 January 2003 the General Directorate of the Ministry of Justice transmitted the request to the Prime Minister’s Office. 14.On an unspecified date examination of the matter of the lifting of the applicant’s parliamentary immunity in the proceedings concerning the insulting of a lawyer was referred to the National Assembly’s joint committee (“the joint committee”) under Rules 131 et seq. of the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly. The joint committee decided to stay the proceedings until the dissolution of the 22nd Parliament. 15.The applicant challenged that decision. His file was then sent before the plenary Assembly of the National Assembly (“the plenary Assembly”). 16.On 11 April 2003 the Konya Assize Court (“the Assize Court”) adopted a decision suspending the criminal proceedings against the applicant for insulting a public official, by virtue of Article 83 of the Constitution and Article 253 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 17.On 4 December 2003 the transmitted the case file to the Ministry of Justice with a view to having the applicant’s parliamentary immunity lifted. 18.On 23 December 2003 the Department of Criminal Affairs of the Ministry of Justice referred the matter to the Prime Minister. 19.The Prime Minister’s Office transmitted the case file to the joint committee. 20.On 28 May 2004, after noting that the applicant had requested the lifting of his immunity, the joint committee decided, in view of the nature of the charges, to stay the proceedings against him for insulting a public official until the end of his term of parliamentary office. It transmitted its decision to the plenary Assembly. 21.When the plenary Assembly met on 8 December 2004 the joint committee’s report was read and appended to the minutes of the meeting. 22.On 15 December 2004 the applicant challenged the joint committee’s decision. In his pleadings he made the point that parliamentary immunity had not been introduced to render MPs unaccountable or immune from punishment, but to allow them to discharge their duties in all freedom and independence and without fear. Unlike non-liability, he argued, inviolability was by nature a relative and temporary privilege. However, the scope of the inviolability, the procedure for lifting it and the shortcomings in its implementation had undermined due respect for the National Assembly. The applicant added that it was unacceptable in a society governed by the rule of law that an arrangement originally intended to help MPs to discharge their duties should be transformed into a personal privilege. 23.On 7 February 2005 the Secretariat of the Speaker’s Office informed the applicant that the two files concerning the lifting of his immunity had been placed on the agenda of the plenary Assembly. 24.At the meeting of the plenary Assembly on 16 February 2005 the applicant once again asked to be allowed to avail himself of his right to be judged in a fair trial and requested that the obstacles to his exercise of that right be removed. 25.The applicant was re-elected as a CHP party MP for the constituency in the parliamentary elections of 22 July 2007. 26.On 8 January 2008 the Speaker of the National Assembly sent him a letter informing him of progress with the procedures for lifting his parliamentary immunity. The relevant passages read as follows: “... during the 22nd Parliament [2002-07] 299 files concerning immunity were forwarded to the joint committee. In 252 cases the committee decided to stay the proceedings until the next dissolution. In 226 cases that decision was challenged. The files corresponding to those cases were placed on the plenary Assembly’s agenda for examination. However, the plenary Assembly did not examine them. During the 22nd Parliament two files concerned your immunity. The first, file no.3/176, concerned the proceedings brought against you by the Konya-Ereğli public prosecutor for insulting a lawyer; the second, file no. 3/453, concerned the proceedings before the for insulting a public official. In both cases the joint committee decided to stay the proceedings until the end of your term of office. Following your appeal, the files were placed on the plenary Assembly’s agenda but have not been examined. In this 23rd Parliament [which started in 2007] 77 files concerning the lifting of immunity remain pending before the joint committee. Two of those files are in your name; they were given the numbers 3/107 and 3/129 following your re-election on 22July 2007. Since the beginning of this Parliament all the files, including yours, have been sent before three preparatory committees set up by the joint committee. These committees started work on 27 December 2007 ... They are to announce their decisions within a month of that date.” 27.On 23 and 24 January 2008 the applicant filed two defence memorials against the suspension of the two sets of criminal proceedings against him. In them he repeated his wish to be allowed to exercise his right to a fair trial. 28.The reports of the joint committee recommending a stay of the criminal proceedings against the applicant until the end of his term as an MP were placed on the National Assembly’s agenda of 15 January 2009, together with the applicant’s objections to those findings. 29.The matter is still pending before the Assembly. 30.Article 83 of the Turkish Constitution, on the subject of parliamentary immunity, reads as follows: “Members of the Turkish Grand National Assembly shall not be liable for their votes and statements in the course of the Assembly’s work, for the views they express before the Assembly or, unless the Assembly decides otherwise on the proposal of the Bureau for that sitting, for repeating or revealing these outside the Assembly. A member who is alleged to have committed an offence before or after election shall not be arrested, questioned, detained or tried unless the Assembly decides otherwise. This provision shall not apply in cases where a member is caught in the act of committing a crime punishable by a heavy penalty and in cases subject to Article 14 of the Constitution if an investigation has been initiated before the election. However, in such situations the competent authority shall notify the Turkish Grand National Assembly immediately and directly. The execution of a criminal sentence imposed on a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly either before or after his election shall be suspended until he ceases to be a member; the statute of limitations does not apply during the term of office. Investigation and prosecution of a re-elected deputy shall be subject to whether or not the Assembly lifts immunity in the case of the individual involved. Political party groups in the Turkish Grand National Assembly shall not hold discussions or take decisions regarding parliamentary immunity.” 31.Article 85 of the Constitution reads as follows: “If the parliamentary immunity of a deputy has been waived ..., the deputy in question or another deputy may, within seven days from the day of the decision of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, appeal to the Constitutional Court for the decision to be annulled on the grounds that it is contrary to the Constitution, law or the rules or procedure of the Turkish Grand National Assembly. The shall decide on the appeal within fifteen days.” 32.The Rules of Procedure of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey provide, inter alia: “Immunity Requests to lift immunity and the committee competent to examine them Rule 131: requests for the lifting of a member’s parliamentary immunity shall be transmitted by the Speaker’s Office to the joint committee, composed of members of the constitutional and judicial committees. ... The preparatory committee and its hearings Rule 132: the Chair of the joint committee shall appoint a preparatory committee composed of five sworn members to examine files concerning immunity. ... This committee shall examine all the documents and, if necessary, hear the member concerned; it shall not hear witnesses. The preparatory committee shall submit its report within one month of being convened. The joint committee shall finalise the report within one month. The report of the joint committee Rule 133: the joint committee shall examine the report and its appendices [submitted by] the preparatory committee. The joint committee shall decide whether to lift the member’s immunity or to stay the proceedings until the end of the term of parliamentary or ministerial office. If the joint committee’s report recommends lifting immunity or if an objection is received within the conditions set out in paragraph 3, the report shall be examined by the plenary Assembly. If the proceedings have been stayed and that decision is not overturned by the plenary Assembly, no action may be taken against the member concerned until the end of his or her term of parliamentary office, even if the legislature has been renewed. The rights of the defence Rule 134: When a request to lift a member’s immunity has been received, the member concerned may, if he wishes, defend himself or be defended by another member before the preparatory committee, the joint committee and the plenary Assembly. The matter shall be decided on the evidence if a member who has asked to speak in his defence fails to answer the invitation to do so. In any event, the defence shall have a say. The mere fact that a member requests permission to waive his or her immunity shall not suffice.” 33.On 21 March 1994 the adopted a series of judgments in cases concerning the lifting of several MPs’ parliamentary immunity. Those cases gave the an opportunity to clarify the scope of parliamentary immunity. The relevant passages of the judgments read as follows: “(a)Meaning of non-liability and parliamentary immunity All democratic countries have granted the members of their legislative assemblies certain privileges and immunities in order to allow them to perform their legislative tasks properly. Quite evidently, the aim of granting the members of legislative assemblies a different status from that enjoyed by other citizens is not to make them a privileged group who are above the law. Parliamentary immunity is not an aim; it is a means of enabling MPs to fulfil the nation’s wishes in full by perfectly reflecting the wishes of the people within the Assembly. Even though Article 83 of the Constitution is entitled ‘Parliamentary Immunity’, it actually establishes two institutions: parliamentary non-liability and parliamentary immunity. The first paragraph of the Article explains that the members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey are not liable for their votes and statements in the course of the Assembly’s work, for the views they express before the Assembly or, unless the Assembly decides otherwise on the proposal of the Speaker, for repeating or revealing these outside the Assembly. The second paragraph of the Article stipulates that a member who is alleged to have committed an offence before or after election may not be arrested, questioned, detained or tried unless the Assembly decides otherwise. The only cases where this provision does not apply are those where a member is caught in the act of committing a crime punishable by a heavy penalty, provided that proceedings were initiated before the election, and cases subject to Article 14 of the Constitution. Article 83 of the Constitution does not specify on what grounds immunity may be lifted, and the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly do not cover the subject. That does not mean that the legislature has a free hand in the matter. The rationale for immunity and the way in which it has developed over the years show that Parliament’s powers concerning the lifting of immunity are not absolute but limited. Furthermore, the fact that immunity has a place in the Constitution means that the rules and aims of immunity must be defined in the light of the rules and aims of the Constitution. There is no doubt that the intention, when immunity was provided for in Article 83, was to allow those responsible for legislative duties to carry them out in the knowledge that they were safely sheltered, and rightly so, from all worry and pressure. In other words, the aim of parliamentary immunity is to ensure that MPs are not prevented, even temporarily, from fulfilling their functions by arbitrary criminal proceedings. So the powers of the legislature in the matter are limited by the purpose for which immunity was institutionalised in the Constitution. ... Provision has been made for decisions of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey concerning the lifting of immunity to be scrutinised by the Constitutional Court with regard to their conformity not only with the Constitution but also with the Rules of Procedure ... When such decisions of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey are scrutinised, attention must be paid to the seriousness of the accusation and whether or not it is politically motivated. In addition, the decision must be in conformity with the rationale behind immunity as a constitutional institution. In criminal proceedings an MP whose parliamentary immunity has been lifted is like any other citizen. He enjoys all the guarantees set out in the Constitution and laws of the . All the principles that apply to citizens likewise apply to him. He may, for example, be taken into police custody, questioned, detained and, to all intents and purposes, subjected like any other citizen to all the applicable procedural rules. ...” 34.Under Article 107 of the old Criminal Code enshrined in Law no.765 of 1 March 1926: “If the opening of proceedings is subject to authorisation, adoption of a decision or the resolution of a problem pending before another body ..., the running of time for the purposes of limitation shall be suspended until such authorisation is obtained, such decision adopted or such problem resolved.” 35.Law no. 5237 on the new Criminal Code was passed on 26September 2004 and published in the Official Gazette on 12 October 2004. Article 67 of the Code provides: “(1)When the investigation or prosecution depend on authorisation, adoption of a decision or the necessary resolution of a problem pending before another body, the running of time for the purposes of limitation shall be suspended until such authorisation [is granted], such decision adopted or such problem resolved ... (2)Where an offence has been committed, the running of time shall be suspended from the time when: (a)the prosecutor questions or takes a statement from the suspect or the accused; (b)a decision is taken to remand the suspect or the accused in custody; (c)an indictment for the offence is issued; (d)a conviction is pronounced, even if it concerns only some of the accused parties. (3)A suspension of limitation causes time to begin to run again. Where there is more than one ground for suspension of limitation, time begins to run again from the date of the last event triggering suspension ...” 36.Under Article 253 § 4 of the old Code of Criminal Procedure enshrined in Law no. 1412 of 4 April 1929, when the criminal proceedings, and therefore the trial, are subject to a condition precedent and it is established that the condition has not been met, a decision to stay the trial is adopted until the condition has been met. On 4 April 2004 a new Code of Criminal Procedure was introduced. 37.On 29 January 2008 the Secretariat of the National Assembly took stock of the number of cases where parliamentary immunity had been lifted since 1991. It found that the National Assembly had lifted the parliamentary immunity of seventeen MPs in the course of the 19th, 20th and 21st Parliaments. According to the lists and information provided by the parties, during the 22nd Parliament 299 files concerning the lifting of immunity were pending before parliamentary bodies, but no decisions to lift immunity were taken. Since the start of the 23rd Parliament, 315 files concerning the lifting of immunity have apparently been pending before the National Assembly.>Relevant Council of Europe and European Union documents 38.Article 40 of the Statute of the Council of Europe (5 May 1949) provides: “a.The Council of Europe, representatives of members and the Secretariat shall enjoy in the territories of its members such privileges and immunities as are reasonably necessary for the fulfilment of their functions. These immunities shall include immunity for all representatives to the Consultative [Parliamentary] Assembly from arrest and all legal proceedings in the territories of all members, in respect of words spoken and votes cast in the debates of the Assembly or its committees or commissions.” 39.The General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe (2 September 1949) includes the following provisions: Article 14 “Representatives to the Consultative [Parliamentary] Assembly and their substitutes shall be immune from all official questioning and from arrest and all legal proceedings in respect of words spoken or votes cast by them in the exercise of their functions.” Article 15 “During the sessions of the Consultative [Parliamentary] Assembly, the representatives to the Assembly and their substitutes, whether they be members of parliament or not, shall enjoy: a.on their national territory, the immunities accorded in those countries to members of parliament; b.on the territory of all other , exemption from arrest and prosecution. This immunity also applies when they are travelling to and from the place of meeting of the Consultative [Parliamentary] Assembly. It does not, however, apply when representatives and their substitutes are found committing, attempting to commit, or just having committed an offence, nor in cases where the Assembly has waived the immunity.” 40.The Protocol to the General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe (6 November 1952) provides: Article 3 “The provisions of Article 15 of the Agreement shall apply to representatives to the [Parliamentary] Assembly, and their substitutes, at any time when they are attending or travelling to and from meetings of committees and sub-committees of the Consultative [Parliamentary] Assembly, whether or not the Assembly is itself in session at such time.” Article 5 “Privileges, immunities and facilities are accorded to the representatives of members not for the personal benefit of the individuals concerned, but in order to safeguard the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Council of Europe. Consequently, a member has not only the right but the duty to waive the immunity of its representative in any case where, in the opinion of the member, the immunity would impede the course of justice and it can be waived without prejudice to the purpose for which the immunity is accorded.” 41.In its Resolution 1490 (2006) on the Interpretation of Article 15.a of the General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe stated: “1.The Parliamentary Assembly refers to its Resolution 1325 (2003) and Recommendation 1602 (2003) on immunities of members of the Parliamentary Assembly, which underlined that immunities are granted in order to preserve the integrity of the Assembly and to safeguard the independence of its members in exercising their European office. ...>It resolves to interpret Article 15.a as follows: regardless of the national regime of immunity, Assembly representatives or substitutes shall be protected against prosecution and arrest in the exercise of their functions as Assembly members or when travelling on Assembly business, whether this is inside or outside of their national territory. If they are not active within this meaning or not travelling on Assembly business, the national regime shall apply within their country.>The Assembly also considers that it is appropriate for the relevant Assembly organs, when examining requests for the waiver of immunity and for the defence of immunity of its members, to question whether the competent national authorities have respected the European Convention on Human Rights as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights and other relevant Council of Europe legal instruments and texts which the respective countries have ratified or accepted. The Assembly should express its concern when Council of Europe norms have been obviously disregarded in respect of one of its members. ... 11.Consequently the Assembly decides to: 11.1.add the following paragraph after paragraph 6 in Rule 64 of the Assembly’s Rules of Procedure: 42.Article 10 of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities (8 April 1965) provides: “During the sessions of the Assembly, its members shall enjoy: (a)in the territory of their own State, the immunities accorded to members of their Parliament; (b)in the territory of any other member State, immunity from any measure of detention and from legal proceedings. Immunity shall likewise apply to members while they are travelling to and from the place of meeting of the Assembly. Immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found in the act of committing an offence and shall not prevent the Assembly from exercising its right to waive the immunity of one of its members.” 43.Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, concerning the waiver of parliamentary immunity, states: “1.In the exercise of its powers in respect of privileges and immunities, Parliament shall seek primarily to uphold its integrity as a democratic legislative assembly and to secure the independence of its members in performance of their duties.>Any request addressed to the President by a competent authority of a member State that the immunity of a member be waived shall be announced in Parliament and referred to the committee responsible.>Any request addressed to the President by a member or a former member to defend privileges and immunities shall be announced in Parliament and referred to the committee responsible. The member or former member may be represented by another member. The request may not be made by another member without the agreement of the member concerned.>As a matter of urgency, in circumstances where a member is arrested or has his freedom of movement curtailed in apparent breach of his privileges and immunities, the President, after having consulted the chairman and rapporteur of the committee responsible, may take an initiative to assert the privileges and immunities of the member concerned. The President shall communicate his initiative to the committee and inform Parliament.”>Comparative law 44.Parliamentary immunity is not a homogeneous notion. Most European states recognise two categories of immunity for parliamentarians: firstly, the “non-liability” of parliamentarians in respect of judicial proceedings for opinions expressed and votes cast in the discharge of their parliamentary duties; secondly, their “inviolability” or “immunity in the strict sense”, shielding them from all arrest, detention or prosecution for offences unrelated to their parliamentary duties without the consent of the Chamber to which they belong. This comparative law study focuses on the latter aspect of parliamentary immunity (see the Venice Commission’s Report on the regime of parliamentary immunity, 1996). 45.The precise scope of the inviolability varies considerably from one country to another. The very nature of this aspect of immunity results in a wide array of legal approaches to its implementation. In some States there is no such institution (the Netherlands, San Marino). In others its scope is very limited. For example, in the inviolability covers civil matters only and MPs enjoy no particular protection in criminal matters and are treated like any other individual. In Ireland and parliamentary inviolability serves to prevent MPs from being arrested during sessions or on their way to or from Parliament. It therefore affords them limited protection. 46.That said, most of the States Parties to the Convention grant their MPs immunity from criminal prosecution during their term as MPs that goes beyond the exercise of parliamentary functions (Albania, Austria and Germany – if the act does not clearly fall outside the ambit of their political activities – and Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Spain and Switzerland) and/or protection against imprisonment or deprivation of liberty (arrest or detention in all those countries which provide for immunity from prosecution, as well as Belgium, France, Georgia, Portugal and Romania). In certain cases MPs are protected from body searches, house searches and interception of their communications (Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Romania and ). Such proceedings or measures may be executed only with the consent of the assembly to which the MP belongs, except in , where such decisions lie with the courts. 47.In several States the scope of inviolability has been restricted, as witnessed by some recent constitutional reforms. In , for example, since the constitutional reform of 1995, the Chamber’s authorisation is no longer necessary for criminal proceedings to be brought, but only for detention, arrest and other judicial supervision measures. A similar change came about in when Constitutional Law no. 3 of 29 October 1993 did away with the need for the prior authorisation of Parliament in order for criminal proceedings to be brought against an MP. In , since the constitutional reform of 2003, senators may be placed under judicial investigation or criminal proceedings brought against them for acts not connected with votes cast or political opinions expressed in the course of their duties as senators. 48.In Germany’s Bundestag the practice is generally for a new parliament to lift immunity from prosecution for all offences (with the exception of defamation of a political character) at the start of the parliamentary term. The aim of this is to protect the reputation of each MP, by ensuring that they attract less media attention if proceedings are brought against them. 49.As to the scope of parliamentary inviolability ratione materiae, that is to say the acts it covers, there is a general tendency in the States Parties to the Convention for cases of flagrante delicto to be excluded. In such cases the prior authorisation of the Chamber concerned is not required, but even this does not necessarily prevent Parliament from examining the matter and subsequently requesting the suspension of the proceedings or the custodial measures (Georgia and , for example). In some countries the law excludes certain types of act from inviolability, or the criterion may be the severity of the penalty incurred (the Portuguese Constitution excludes, in certain circumstances, deliberate offences punishable with imprisonment for over three years). 50.The duration of parliamentary inviolability also varies from one country to another. Some countries extend parliamentary immunity to criminal proceedings brought prior to the MP’s election (Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal and Spain). In other countries, even if parliamentary authorisation is not required in order for proceedings initiated prior to the MP’s election to be continued, Parliament may, of its own motion or at the request of the interested party, request the suspension of the proceedings or the waiving of restrictive measures during the MP’s term of office (France, Poland and Switzerland). 51.Parliamentary immunity may be lifted in most countries. The procedure for lifting immunity is generally the same. It is usually provided for in the Chamber’s Rules of Procedure. It is set in motion by a proposal or a request for authorisation by the competent public authority (in most cases the Principal State Prosecutor), the injured party or the parliamentarian concerned. The request is transmitted to the Speaker of the Parliament, either directly or in certain cases through another authority (the Minister of Justice, the Prime Minister), then examined by a special or ad hoc parliamentary committee, which gives an opinion after hearing the MP concerned. It is then for the full Chamber to decide, with or without a debate, in private or in public, whether or not to lift immunity. The possibility of appealing against a decision of the Chamber to lift immunity exists in very few countries (Austria and Germany). 52.The possibility for MPs to waive their own parliamentary immunity is not widespread (Poland and Switzerland) and is sometimes limited to minor offences (summary offences in Hungary) or to specific offences (defamation in Ireland and the United Kingdom). Under Poland’s Constitution MPs have the right to consent to criminal proceedings. In the Federal Assembly Act gives MPs the right to consent in writing to be prosecuted or arrested. 53.In most of the Contracting States no provision is made for MPs to forgo their immunity of their own free will because immunity is a privilege granted not to MPs on an individual basis but to Parliament, to guarantee its smooth operation. In provisions governing immunity are traditionally a matter of public policy and MPs cannot renounce it. Any act that violates parliamentary immunity is considered null and void. The question of immunity must be raised by a judge. A similar approach has been adopted in the European Parliament, where renunciation of immunity has no legal effect. 54.This comparative presentation does not reveal any uniformpattern of existing parliamentary practice. It is worth noting, however, that a majority of European countries have recognised parliamentary immunity and incorporated it in their constitutional systems as an essential factor in the smooth functioning of the legislature. 55.There are nevertheless marked differences in the nature and scope of the protection inviolability offers MPs. They reflect the different political and historical experiences of the States, and often illustrate the needs that underlie inviolability. It would appear that the scope of this privilege, which is considered as an inextricable part of the separation of powers, the autonomy of Parliament or the protection of the parliamentary opposition, is defined in each State in keeping with the degree of autonomy necessary for Parliament to be able to fulfil its duties.",2009,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

28,001-58276,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicants, MrFikret Başkaya and Mr Mehemet Selim Okçuoğlu, are Turkish citizens. The first applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Ankara. He is a professor of economics and a journalist. The second applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Istanbul. He is the owner of a publishing house, Doz Basin Yayin Ltd Sti. 10.In April 1991 Doz Basin Yayin Ltd Sti published a book written bythe first applicant and entitled Batılılaşma, Çağdaşlaşma, Kalkınma – Paradigmanın İflası/Resmi İdeolojinin Eleştirisine Giriş (“Westernisation, Modernisation, Development – Collapse of a Paradigm/An Introduction to the Critique of the Official Ideology”). The book was an academic essay of 219 pages, containing 370 references, which involved a description of the socio-economic evolution of Turkey since the 1920s and the analysis and criticism of the “official ideology” of the State. According to the titles listed in the table of contents, the author dealt with the following topics: Intelligentsia and Official Ideology; The Characteristics of the National Struggle; The Question of the National Character of the National Struggle; The Comintern and whether the National Struggle was Anti-Imperialist; Mustafa Kemal and the Individual’s Role in History; The Characteristics of the Kemalist Regime: an Original Form of Bonapartism; Productive Forces and Economic Policies; Bonapartist Regime and Accumulation of Capital; A Classless, Privilegeless, Populist Dictatorship; The Evolution of Socio-Economic Formation in the Neo-Colonialist Era; The Eighties: Strengthening of the Satellitisation Process; The Collapse of the Paradigm and the Science of Economics: Means to Legitimise Existing Tendencies. 11.The impugned chapter of the book included the following passages: “The Kurdish problem plays a significant role in the analysis of the evolution of Milli Mücadele [Turkish National Independence War (1919-1922)] and Turkish social formation. The Kurdish problem and the process of the colonisation of Kurdistan are indeed very important and, as such, should be the subject-matter of another book. Moreover, the problem is not only related to Turkey. The formation of the domestic politics of four States in the region (Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria) (type of political regimes) as well as the ‘unique’ nature of relationships between these four neighbouring States make it a complicated issue. We have two reasons why we wish to discuss the problem, even if in limited form, within the plan and scope of this book. These are to indicate the ‘irrationality’ of official ideology and the real nature of Milli Mücadele. In other words, [we wish] to discuss whether what is presented as ‘Kurtuluş Savaşı’ [Independence War] is in reality an ‘Independence Movement’ or not. Without any doubt, the imprisonment of Kurdistan (if the small area within the borders of the Soviet Union is omitted) within the borders of four different States gives the imperialists too easily ‘control’ over these four States. Although the Kurdish problem is of great importance with regard to the protection of the imperialist status quo in the region, we shall not here go into an analysis of this aspect of the problem. [page 51] ... On the other hand, the racist policy of denial which has been followed with regard to the Kurds since the foundation of the Republic [1923] has also been an important factor in the development of the fascist movement in Turkey. As a contradiction, even though ‘the assumption of non-existence’ of the Kurdish Nation constitutes an important element of the official ideology, this is at the same time the weakest point of the ideology in question. It is not possible ‘to eliminate with the mind’ a nation which exists and the objective reality continues to exist regardless of the nonsense and unfounded suspicions of the people. Of course, this does not mean that the nonsense, unfounded suspicions have no effect! There is never a lack of those who profit from it, acquire bureaucratic, academic careers, receive high salaries, go up the step ladder of the political arena ... [page 52] ... It was believed that colonialism would come to an end with the abolishment of direct political-military-police control in the colonies. Today, however, the [natural] resources of the Third World are carried to imperialist countries in volumes which are much higher than those of the colonial period. Therefore, the relationship between the Turkish State and Kurdistan is not of an imperialist devouring category. One can speak of a situation which also directly embodies a political, military, cultural, ideological oppression. Thus, a direct colony status is in force. [page 59]” 12.It appears that the publication of the book came to the notice of the prosecution authorities on 3 May 1991. 13.On 2 August 1991 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court (İstanbul Devlet Güvenlik Mahkemesi), having regard to the contents of the book in question, issued an indictment against the applicants. The first applicant, as the author of the book, was charged under section8(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (“the 1991 Act”) with disseminating propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. The second applicant, as the owner of the publishing company, was charged under section 8(2) of the 1991 Act. In the bill of indictment, the public prosecutor quoted extracts from the chapter of the book reproduced at paragraph 11 above. 14.In the proceedings before the National Security Court, the applicants denied the charges and sought their acquittal. The first applicant submitted that his book had been an academic work that could not be viewed as propaganda. Being a professor he had had the duty to conduct research and publish his conclusions and could not be forced to accept the “official version of reality”. His book might be judged by academics, but not by the courts. It could not be permissible to try and convict someone for the expression of his or her opinion. The second applicant submitted, inter alia, that it was not possible to make an assessment of the book as a whole solely on the basis of extracts from a single chapter. He alleged that section 8 of the 1991 Act was inconsistent with the Turkish Constitution and Turkey’s international obligations. There was a “Kurdish problem” in Turkey and commenting or expressing ideas on this problem could not constitute an offence. 15.In a final statement dated 18 March 1992, the public prosecutor requested the conviction of the first applicant under section 8(1) of the 1991 Act and that of the second applicant under section 8(2), as well as the confiscation of all copies of the book. The public prosecutor considered that the offence had been committed on 3 May 1991. 16.On 14 October 1992 the court acquitted the applicants. It held that the book as a whole was an academic work containing no elements of propaganda. 17.The public prosecutor appealed. He submitted that the book alleged that a certain part of Turkish territory had belonged to “Kurdistan” which the Turks had annexed and colonised. Concluding that the book did indeed disseminate propaganda against the indivisibility of the State, he requested that the verdict be set aside. 18.On 4 February 1993 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the trial court and referred the case back for retrial. It gave the following reasons: “In the writings on pages 51 to 59 of the book … it is stated that a part of the territory within the borders of the Turkish Republic is a part of Kurdistan which belongs to the Kurdish nation, and that this territory has been annexed by the Turks and is subject to colony status. The Istanbul National Security Court, without considering that [the above] statement, as such, exceeds the limits of criticism and constitutes dissemination of propaganda against the indivisible integrity of the State of the Turkish Republic with its territory and nation, found [both] accused ‘not guilty’. The judgment … is contrary to the law and thus, the public prosecutor’s grounds of appeal are upheld. Accordingly, it is unanimously decided that the judgment be reversed …” 19.In a judgment dated 5 August 1993, the Istanbul National Security Court found the applicants guilty of the offences with which they had been charged. It sentenced the first applicant to two years’ imprisonment and a fine of 50,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) and the second applicant to six months’ imprisonment and a fine of TRL 50,000,000. Considering the applicants’ good conduct during the trial, the court reduced the first applicant’s sentence to one year and eight months’ imprisonment and a fine of TRL 41,666,666 and the second applicant’s sentence to five months’ imprisonment and a fine of TRL 41,666,666. On the other hand, the court dismissed the public prosecutor’s request for an order of confiscation of the book. In its reasoning supporting the convictions, the court stated: “After the examination of the book which is the subject of the offence, it is understood that the [following] statements on page 51 that ‘The Kurdish problem plays a significant role in the analysis of the evolution of Milli Mücadele [Turkish National Independence War (1919-1922)] and Turkish social formation. The Kurdish problem and the process of the colonisation of Kurdistan are indeed very important and, as such, should be the subject-matter of another book. Moreover, the problem is not only related to Turkey. The formation of the domestic politics of four States in the region (Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria) ...’, ‘to discuss whether what is presented as “Kurtuluş Savaşı” [Independence War] is in reality an “Independence Movement” or not. Without any doubt, the imprisonment of Kurdistan (if the small area within the borders of the Soviet Union is omitted) within the borders of four different States gives the imperialists too easily “control” over these four States ...’, on page 52 that ‘the racist policy of denial which has been followed with regard to the Kurds since the foundation of the Republic [1923] has also been an important factor in the development of the fascist movement in Turkey... It is not possible “to eliminate with the mind” a nation which exists ...’ and on page 59 that ‘the relationship between the Turkish State and Kurdistan is not of an imperialist devouring category. One can speak of a situation which also directly embodies a political, military, cultural, ideological oppression. Thus, a direct colony status is in force.’ identify a certain part of the Turkish Republic as Kurdistan, declare that the Turkish Republic rules this region with colony status and thus aim to disseminate propaganda against the indivisible integrity of the State of the Turkish Republic with its territory and nation. Therefore, the following sentence shall be drafted under the provisions of Law no. 3713 which is applicable to the proven acts of the accused.” 20.The applicants appealed to the Court of Cassation, which held a hearing in the case. The applicants, while reiterating the defence made before the National Security Court, emphasised that the latter had failed to consider the book as a whole and had erroneously based its decision on an assessment of one chapter. The first applicant maintained that section 8 of the 1991 Act was inconsistent with the Turkish Constitution and the Convention, and he could not therefore be tried and convicted under that provision. He also referred to his previous arguments concerning the lack of clarity of the relevant provisions of the 1991 Act. The second applicant asserted that his sentence to imprisonment had been unlawful in that section8(2) only authorised the imposition of a fine. 21.In its decision of 16 December 1993, delivered on 22December1993, the Court of Cassation upheld the National Security Court’s findings and dismissed the appeals. 22.As of 18 March 1994 the first applicant was dismissed, under section98(2) of the Civil Servants Act (Law no. 367), from his post as lecturer at the University of Ankara. The relevant decision referred to his conviction under the 1991 Act and to his being sentenced to twenty months’ imprisonment. 23.On 3 October 1997 the National Security Court granted a request by the prosecution for an order of seizure in respect of the sixth edition of the impugned book. 24.The applicants served their sentences in prison and paid the fines. After the amendments made by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995 to the 1991 Act, the Istanbul National Security Court re-examined the second applicant’s case. On 19 April 1996 the court held that these amendments could not be applied to his case as he had already served his sentence. 25.The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows: Article 2 § 2 “Where the legislative provisions in force at the time when a crime is committed are different from those of a later law, the provisions most favourable to the offender shall be applied.” Article 36 § 1 “In the event of conviction, the court shall order the seizure and confiscation of any object which has been used for the commission or preparation of the crime or offence …” 26.The relevant provisions of the Press Act 1950 read as follows: Section 3 “For the purposes of the present Law, the term ‘periodicals’ shall mean newspapers, press agency dispatches and any other printed matter published at regular intervals. ‘Publication’ shall mean the exposure, display, distribution, emission, sale or offer for sale of printed matter on premises to which the public have access where anyone may see it. An offence shall not be deemed to have been committed through the medium of the press unless publication has taken place, except where the material in itself is unlawful.” 27.The relevant provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 read as follows: Section 8 (before amendment by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “[(1)]Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited, irrespective of the methods used and the intention. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than two and not more than five years’ imprisonment and a fine of from fifty million to one hundred million Turkish liras. [(2)]Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the above paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched[]. However the fine may not be less than one hundred million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical concerned shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher and sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment.” Section 8 (as amended by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “[(1)]Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than one and not more than three years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras. The penalty imposed on a reoffender may not be commuted to a fine. [(2)]Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly. However, the fine may not be less than one hundred million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical concerned shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher and sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment. [(3)]Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of printed matter or by means of mass communication other than periodicals within the meaning of the second paragraph, those responsible and the owners of the means of mass communication shall be sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras … …” The Government have submitted case-law concerning the application of section 8, details of which may be found in Karataş v. Turkey [GC], no.23168/94, § 22, ECHR 1999-IV. Section 13 (before amendment by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “The penalties for the offences contemplated in the present Law may not be commuted to a fine or any other measure, nor may they be accompanied by a reprieve.” Section 13 (as amended by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “The penalties for the offences contemplated in the present Law may not be commuted to a fine or any other measure, nor may they be accompanied by a reprieve. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply to convictions pursuant to section 8.” 28.A summary of the relevant domestic law governing the organisation and procedure of the National Security Courts is contained in Karataş cited above, §§ 24-29.",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION.
V.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 §§ 1 AND 2 AND ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION
81.  BEFORE THE COMMISSION, THE FIRST APPLICANT COMPLAINED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A BREACH OF HIS RIGHT TO A FAIR HEARING UNDER ARTICLE 6 § 1 IN THAT THE DOMESTIC COURTS HAD FAILED TO CONSIDER HIS BOOK AS A WHOLE. MOREOVER, REFERRING TO THE SAME MATTERS AS WITH REGARD TO HIS COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE 7, HE ALSO ALLEGED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A VIOLATION OF HIS RIGHT UNDER ARTICLE 6 § 2 TO BE PRESUMED INNOCENT OF A CRIMINAL OFFENCE UNTIL PROVED GUILTY. THE COMMISSION FOUND IT UNNECESSARY TO EXAMINE THESE ALLEGATIONS, IN VIEW OF ITS CONCLUSIONS ON THE OTHER CONVENTION ISSUES RAISED.
THE COURT FURTHER NOTES THAT AT THE COMMISSION STAGE THE SECOND APPLICANT, REFERRING BASICALLY TO THE SAME FACTS AS IN HIS COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE 10, ALLEGED A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FORMER ARTICLE. THE COMMISSION CONCLUDED THAT NO SEPARATE ISSUE AROSE UNDER THESE PROVISIONS TAKEN TOGETHER.
HOWEVER, THE APPLICANTS DID NOT MENTION THE ABOVE COMPLAINTS BEFORE THE COURT, WHICH DOES NOT CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THEM OF ITS OWN MOTION.
VI.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION
82.  THE APPLICANTS CLAIMED COMPENSATION FOR PECUNIARY AND NONPECUNIARY DAMAGE AS WELL AS REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE DOMESTIC AND THE CONVENTION PROCEEDINGS. ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION PROVIDES:
“IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION OR THE PROTOCOLS THERETO, AND IF THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTY CONCERNED ALLOWS ONLY PARTIAL REPARATION TO BE MADE, THE COURT SHALL, IF NECESSARY, AFFORD JUST SATISFACTION TO THE INJURED PARTY.”
A.  PECUNIARY DAMAGE
83.  THE FIRST APPLICANT CLAIMED 500,000 FRENCH FRANCS (FRF) IN COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF EARNINGS AND OF RETIREMENT BONUS RESULTING FROM THE FACT THAT, BECAUSE OF THE TERMINATION OF HIS APPOINTMENT, HE WAS FORCED TO RETIRE AT THE AGE OF 54, THIRTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE NORMAL AGE OF RETIREMENT.
HE ALSO CLAIMED FRF 420,000 IN COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF INCOME FROM THE SALES OF HIS BOOK, CORRESPONDING TO 15% OF THE ESTIMATED RETURN FROM THE SALE OF 70,000 COPIES. AT THE TIME WHEN THE BOOK WAS BANNED AND A CONFISCATION ORDER WAS IMPOSED, 30,000 COPIES HAD BEEN PRINTED, WHEREAS 70,000 MORE COPIES WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN MADE.
84.  THE SECOND APPLICANT, REFERRING TO THE FIRST APPLICANT’S CALCULATIONS, CLAIMED COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF 20% IN PROFITS FROM THE SALE OF THE BOOK. IN THE LIGHT OF THE CALCULATIONS MADE BY THE FIRST APPLICANT, THE SECOND APPLICANT’S LOSS COULD BE ESTIMATED AS AMOUNTING TO APPROXIMATELY FRF 440,000.
85.  BOTH APPLICANTS IN ADDITION SOUGHT COMPENSATION IN AN AMOUNT CORRESPONDING TO THE 41,666,666 TURKISH LIRAS THEY HAD EACH PAID IN FINES. ACCORDING TO THE FIRST APPLICANT THIS CORRESPONDED TO FRF 7,400.
86.  THE GOVERNMENT CONTESTED THE ABOVE CLAIMS. THEY DISPUTED THAT THE FIRST APPLICANT HAD SUSTAINED ANY ECONOMIC LOSS AS A RESULT OF HIS EARLY RETIREMENT. HE HAD BEEN RECEIVING A SUBSTANTIAL PENSION SINCE 1998. IN ANY EVENT, NOTHING WOULD HAVE PREVENTED HIM FROM SEEKING ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT, WHICH IS CUSTOMARY FOR EARLY RETIREES IN TURKEY.
AS REGARDS THE CLAIMS RELATED TO THE ALLEGED LOSS OF INCOME FROM SALES OF THE BOOK, THE SUGGESTION THAT IT WOULD HAVE SOLD 100,000 COPIES WAS ENTIRELY UNFOUNDED. EVEN THE BEST-SELLING BOOKS IN TURKEY DO NOT REACH AS HIGH A LEVEL OF CIRCULATION.
87.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT MAKE ANY COMMENTS IN THIS CONNECTION.
88.  THE COURT IS SATISFIED THAT THERE WAS A SUFFICIENT CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN THE ALLEGED PECUNIARY DAMAGE AND THE VIOLATIONS FOUND OF THE FIRST AND SECOND APPLICANTS’ RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 10 AND THE SECOND APPLICANT’S RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 7. THE FINES IMPOSED ON THE APPLICANTS AND PAID BY THEM SHOULD BE REIMBURSED IN THEIR ENTIRETY. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE COURT DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT THE EVIDENCE SUBMITTED LENDS ITSELF TO A PRECISE QUANTIFICATION OF THE FIRST APPLICANT’S LOSS OF EARNINGS RESULTING FROM HIS DISMISSAL BY THE UNIVERSITY OR HIS AND THE SECOND APPLICANT’S LOSS OF PROSPECTIVE INCOME FROM FUTURE SALES OF THE IMPUGNED BOOK. MAKING AN OVERALL ASSESSMENT ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS, THE COURT AWARDS THE FIRST APPLICANT FRF 67,400 AND THE SECOND APPLICANT FRF 17,400 IN RESPECT OF PECUNIARY DAMAGE.
B.  NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE
89.  THE FIRST APPLICANT, MR BAŞKAYA, REQUESTED FRF 1,000,000 IN COMPENSATION FOR THE SUFFERING CAUSED BY HIS CONVICTION AND BY HIS HAVING SERVED FIFTEEN OF HIS TWENTY MONTHS’ SENTENCE TO IMPRISONMENT. WHILE HE HAD LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS OF FURTHER ADVANCEMENT IN HIS ACADEMIC CAREER, THESE MEASURES HAD RESULTED IN THE TERMINATION OF HIS EMPLOYMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY. THE MEASURES HAD NOT ONLY SEVERELY AFFECTED HIS LIFE AS AN ACADEMIC AND INTELLECTUAL BUT HAD ALSO DEPRIVED HIM OF THE POSSIBILITY OF TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS AND STANDING FOR ELECTION.
90.  THE SECOND APPLICANT, WITHOUT SPECIFYING AN AMOUNT, CLAIMED COMPENSATION FOR THE DAMAGE WHICH HE HAD SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS, HIS CONVICTION AND IMPRISONMENT.
91.  FOR THE GOVERNMENT THE FINDING OF A VIOLATION WOULD CONSTITUTE ADEQUATE JUST SATISFACTION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION, THE ALLEGATIONS OF SUFFERING BEING UNSUBSTANTIATED AND THE AMOUNT CLAIMED, IN THE CASE OF THE FIRST APPLICANT, BEING MORE THAN EXCESSIVE.
92.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT OFFER ANY COMMENTS.
93.  THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT BOTH APPLICANTS MUST HAVE SUFFERED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DISTRESS WHICH CANNOT BE COMPENSATED SOLELY BY THE COURT’S FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS. THE COURT, HAVING REGARD TO THE NATURE OF THE VIOLATIONS FOUND IN THE PRESENT CASE AND DECIDING ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS, AWARDS THE FIRST APPLICANT FRF 40,000 AND THE SECOND APPLICANT FRF 45,000 UNDER THE HEAD OF NONPECUNIARY DAMAGE.
C.  COSTS AND EXPENSES
94.  THE FIRST APPLICANT SOUGHT THE REIMBURSEMENT OF FRF 250,000, APPARENTLY IN RESPECT OF COSTS IN THE DOMESTIC PROCEEDINGS, AND FRF 100,000, SEEMINGLY IN RESPECT OF COSTS BEFORE THE CONVENTION INSTITUTIONS.
95.  THE SECOND APPLICANT ASKED THE COURT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HIS AGREEMENT WITH HIS LAWYER TO PAY HER 25,000 US DOLLARS.
96.  THE GOVERNMENT STATED THAT THE AMOUNT CLAIMED WAS EXAGGERATED IN COMPARISON WITH FEES EARNED BY TURKISH LAWYERS IN THE DOMESTIC COURTS AND HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY JUSTIFIED.
97.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT COMMENT.
98.  THE COURT WILL CONSIDER THE ABOVE CLAIMS IN THE LIGHT OF THE CRITERIA LAID DOWN IN ITS CASE-LAW, NAMELY WHETHER THE COSTS AND EXPENSES WERE ACTUALLY AND NECESSARILY INCURRED IN ORDER TO PREVENT OR OBTAIN REDRESS FOR THE MATTER FOUND TO CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION AND WERE REASONABLE AS TO QUANTUM. AS TO THE LATTER, IT DOES NOT REGARD ITSELF BOUND BY DOMESTIC SCALES AND PRACTICES, ALTHOUGH IT MAY DERIVE SOME ASSISTANCE FROM THEM (SEE, AMONG MANY OTHER AUTHORITIES, THE TOLSTOY MILOSLAVSKY V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT OF 13 JULY 1995, SERIES A NO. 316-B, P. 83, § 77, AND NIKOLOVA V. BULGARIA [GC], NO. 31195/96, § 79, ECHR 1999-II). TO A LARGE DEGREE, THE COURT SHARES THE GOVERNMENT’S VIEWS THAT THE CLAIMS MADE ARE UNSUBSTANTIATED AND EXCESSIVE. THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO AS REGARDS THOSE OF THE SECOND APPLICANT, WHO DID NOT SUBMIT A MEMORIAL TO THE COURT ON THE MERITS OF HIS CASE. DECIDING ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS, THE COURT AWARDS THE FIRST AND SECOND APPLICANTS RESPECTIVELY FRF 22,000 AND FRF 15,000 UNDER THE HEAD OF COSTS AND EXPENSES.
D.  DEFAULT INTEREST
99.  THE COURT DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE TO ADOPT THE STATUTORY RATE OF INTEREST APPLICABLE IN FRANCE AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF THE PRESENT JUDGMENT, WHICH IS 3.47 % PER ANNUM.
FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT
1.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION TO EXAMINE THE FIRST APPLICANT’S COMPLAINTS UNDER ARTICLES 3 AND 14 OF THE CONVENTION;
2.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE CONVENTION WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST APPLICANT;
3.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE CONVENTION WITH RESPECT TO THE SECOND APPLICANT;
4.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION WITH RESPECT TO BOTH APPLICANTS;
5.	DISMISSES UNANIMOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT’S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION CONCERNING THE EXHAUSTION OF DOMESTIC REMEDIES IN RELATION TO THE APPLICANTS’ COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION;
6.	HOLDS BY SIXTEEN VOTES TO ONE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION AS REGARDS THE COMPLAINT RELATING TO THE INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY OF THE ISTANBUL NATIONAL SECURITY COURT;
7.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE APPLICANTS’ FURTHER COMPLAINTS UNDER RESPECTIVELY ARTICLE 6 §§ 1 AND 2 OF THE CONVENTION AND ARTICLE 14 TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 10;
8.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY
(A)	THAT THE RESPONDENT STATE IS TO PAY THE FIRST AND SECOND APPLICANTS, WITHIN THREE MONTHS, THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS, TO BE CONVERTED INTO TURKISH LIRAS AT THE RATE APPLICABLE ON THE DATE OF SETTLEMENT:
(B)	THAT SIMPLE INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 3.47% SHALL BE PAYABLE ON THESE SUMS FROM THE EXPIRY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED THREE MONTHS UNTIL SETTLEMENT;
9.	DISMISSES UNANIMOUSLY THE REMAINDER OF THE APPLICANTS’ CLAIMS FOR JUST SATISFACTION.

66,001-60597,Grand Chamber,"11.At the material time the applicant was employed as a clerk in the İzmir 2nd Court of Taxation. On 18 July 1995 the İzmir Civil Court of General Jurisdiction forwarded the name and workplace of the applicant to the İzmir public prosecutor's office, stating that the applicant was suspected of having stolen and falsified court documents relating to a decided divorce case. 12.On 25 July 1995 the office of the public prosecutor referred the case to the İzmir Security Directorate. 13.At 5.10 p.m. on 25 July 1995 the applicant was taken into police custody and detained at the İzmir Security Directorate. He was accused of the above offences. The applicant gave a statement in which he denied that he had been involved in the incident relating to the court's case file. The applicant later claimed that he was not permitted to contact his family or consult a lawyer and that he was insulted and beaten for two hours. 14.Two other suspects were also detained and statements were taken from them. A statement was also taken from A.B., a party to the divorce proceedings. 15.On 27 July 1995 an investigation record was drawn up for the applicant and the two other suspects. At 5 p.m. on the same day the applicant was released pursuant to the decision of the public prosecutor. The two other suspects were kept in custody. 16.In the evening of 27 July 1995, following his release, the applicant went to the İzmir State Hospital. He was subsequently granted four days' sick leave by his employer. The medical report prepared at the hospital referred to the fact that the applicant was suffering from a common skin disease caused by the inflammation of the roots of his facial hair. 17.On 31 July 1995 the office of the public prosecutor of Karşıyaka decided not to bring charges against the applicant (takipsizlik kararı) for lack of evidence. The decision was served on the applicant on 19 August 1995. 18.The public prosecutor took a statement from the applicant on 28August 1995. In his statement the applicant declared that he had applied to the Ministry of Justice to have proceedings brought against the individual who had reported him to the authorities. 19.On 29 August 1995 the public prosecutor decided not to bring charges against the person named by the applicant. 20.On 5 September 1995 the applicant filed a complaint under Lawno.466 with the Karşıyaka Assize Court (Ağır Ceza Mahkemesi) against the Treasury requesting 200,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) by way of compensation for his detention between “24 and 27 July 1995”. In the petition, the applicant's lawyer stated, inter alia, that the applicant, while in detention, had been tortured and ill-treated by being beaten and insulted for two hours and deprived of his right to contact his family and a lawyer. As a result of his injuries, the applicant had had to take four days' sick leave. Furthermore, the applicant's reputation had suffered. He did not rely on any specific section of Law no. 466. 21.On 14 September 1995 the three-judge Karşıyaka Assize Court appointed one of its members (naip hakim) to investigate the case and draft a report. The judge designated for this purpose verified, inter alia, that the office of the public prosecutor of İzmir had dropped the charges against the applicant. He also obtained information about the applicant's personal, financial and social status. The judge found that the evidence obtained was sufficient to enable him to draft his report and decided in the exercise of his discretion under section 3 of Law no. 466 that it was unnecessary to hear the applicant. The public prosecutor was asked for his written observations on the applicant's claim. On 7 December 1995 the public prosecutor, as required by Law no. 466, submitted his opinion to the Karşıyaka Assize Court. The public prosecutor noted that the applicant was taken into custody on 25 July 1995, and not on 24 July 1995 as claimed, and was released on 27 July 1995. The public prosecutor recommended that the applicant be granted compensation for non-pecuniary damage in an amount to be assessed by the court. This opinion was not served on the applicant. 22.The judge stated in his report of 7 December 1995 to the President of the Karşıyaka Assize Court, inter alia, that the applicant had been detained for two days from 25 July to 27 July 1995 and upon his release had obtained a medical report which indicated that he had been assaulted (darp edildiği). The judge noted that the applicant had been given four days' sick leave by his employer. He further observed that, at the time when he was taken into custody, the applicant had been working in the İzmir 2nd Court of Taxation, had been paying TRL 3,000,000 in rent, was divorced and had two children. The judge concluded: “The complainant requested that he be granted the sum of TRL 200,000,000 in compensation. In determining the amount of compensation the court should consider both the complainant's economic and social position as well as the intensity of his emotional suffering. In the light of the above facts, I propose that the court grant the amount of compensation requested by the complainant.” 23.On 7 December 1995 the Karşıyaka Assize Court found that the applicant had been detained for two days and qualified for compensation. In its judgment, the court took note of all the complaints set out in the petition lodged by the applicant's lawyer as well as the content of the judge's report and the written submissions of the public prosecutor (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above). The court concluded that “... at the time he was taken into custody, the applicant had been working in the İzmir Tax Court, had been paying TRL 3,000,000 in rent, and was divorced with two children. The complainant requested that the court award him TRL 200,000,000, including interest, for the non-pecuniary damage suffered. The court considers that, in determining the amount of compensation, it should have regard both to the complainant's economic and social position as well as the intensity of his emotional suffering. In the light of the above facts and having considered the above criteria, the court concludes that the sum of TRL 10,000,000 should be awarded to the complainant”. The court also awarded the applicant TRL 1,500,000 for his legal costs. 24.The applicant's lawyer and the Treasury both appealed against the award. The applicant's lawyer contended on appeal that the amount of compensation was insufficient reparation for his wrongful arrest and detention. He did not challenge the dates of detention as determined by the court. The Treasury considered that the amount awarded was excessive. According to the relevant rules governing the functioning of the Court of Cassation in litigation of this nature, the case file at the Karşıyaka Assize Court was referred to the competent division of the Court of Cassation through the intermediary of the office of the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. On 17 October 1996 the Principal Public Prosecutor submitted his opinion on the merits of both parties' appeals. In his written opinion (tebliğname) to the Sixth Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation (Yargıtay), the Principal Public Prosecutor stated that, having regard to the first-instance proceedings, the evidence collected, the subject matter of the claim and the discretion of the first-instance court, neither of the parties had grounds for appeal. He advised that both appeals be rejected and that the first-instance judgment be approved, being in compliance with procedural rules and law. This opinion was not submitted to the applicant. 25.On 7November 1996 the Sixth Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation, having regard, inter alia, to the opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor, upheld the judgment of 7 December 1995. 26.According to information submitted by the Government, the applicant never applied to obtain the compensation awarded to him by the Karşıyaka Assize Court. 27.Article 19 of the Constitution provides: “Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with the formalities and conditions prescribed by law: ... The arrested or detained person must be brought before a judge within forty-eight hours at the latest or, in the case of offences committed by more than one person, within fifteen days ... These time-limits may be extended during a state of emergency ... ... A person deprived of his liberty, for whatever reason, shall have the right to take proceedings before a judicial authority which shall give a speedy ruling on his case and order his immediate release if it finds that the deprivation of liberty was unlawful. Compensation must be paid by the State, as the law shall provide, for damage sustained by persons who have been victims of treatment contrary to the above provisions.” 28.Under Article 128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, an arrested person must be brought before a judge within twenty-four hours or, where the offence has been committed by more than one person, within four days. 29.Section 1 of Law no. 466 on the payment of compensation to persons arrested or detained provides: “Compensation shall be paid by the State in respect of all damage sustained by persons: (1)who have been arrested or detained under conditions or in circumstances incompatible with the Constitution or statute law; (2)who have not been immediately informed of the reasons for their arrest or detention; (3)who have not been brought before a judicial officer after being arrested or detained within the time-limit laid down by statute for that purpose; (4)who have been deprived of their liberty without a court order after the statutory time-limit for being brought before a judicial officer has expired; (5)whose close family have not been immediately informed of their arrest or detention; (6)who, after being arrested or detained in accordance with the law, are not subsequently committed for trial..., or are acquitted or discharged after standing trial; or (7)who have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment shorter than the period spent in detention or ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty only.” 30.By virtue of section 2 of Law no. 466, a claimant must apply for compensation to the local assize court within three months, setting out the facts complained of and indicating the amount claimed. The claim is lodged against the Treasury. 31.According to section 3 of the same Law: “The competent court ... shall appoint one of its members upon the submission of the petition for compensation. The appointed member shall first examine whether the request was lodged within the statutory time-limit. Where the appointed member finds that the request was lodged within the statutory time-limit he shall collect all evidence including the case file and the judgment [concerning the criminal proceedings]. If necessary, he shall take oral evidence from the claimant. The appointed member shall transfer the case file to the office of the public prosecutor for his opinion after collecting all the evidence. Upon the receipt of the public prosecutor's written opinion, the court shall give its decision without holding a hearing. The petitioner has the right to lodge an appeal against the court's decision within one week after he is notified of this decision.” 32.A claimant is entitled to seek compensation for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage arising from unlawful detention. A pecuniary claim must be documented. Non-pecuniary damage is awarded on the basis of the claimant's personal, financial and social status. 33.The relevant parts of Article 438 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide: “The Court of Cassation shall examine the appeal without holding a hearing. The Court of Cassation shall notify the parties of the date of the oral hearing, if either of the parties requested a hearing in their petitions, in the following cases: ... –in actions in which the amount requested is more than 200,000,000 Turkish liras. ...” 34.In the Turkish legal system, when a judgment of a first-instance court is appealed, the case file is first sent to the Office of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. The Principal Public Prosecutor, who is independent of the executive and of the parties, submits an opinion (tebliğname) on the case to the competent division of the Court of Cassation. The submission of the opinion by the Principal Public Prosecutor is regulated by Article 28 § 2 of the Code of the Court of Cassation no. 2797. According to the Government, the opinion is prepared by the assistants of the Principal Public Prosecutor and is included in a short document which indicates that the file has been seen by the first-instance court and advises whether the latter's judgment should be quashed or upheld. The opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor is not binding on the division of the Court of Cassation which will consider the appeal.",2002,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

170,001-95031,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicant was born in 1929 and lives in Vittoriosa. 10.The applicant is the brother of Mrs M., who lived in an apartment above Mr F. 11.On 17 July 1985 Mr F. applied for an injunction to restrain Mrs M. from hanging out clothes to dry over the courtyard of his apartment, thereby allegedly interfering with his property rights. Mr F. relied on the provisions of Article 403 of the Maltese Civil Code in this connection. 12.On one occasion following a hearing on the injunction, and after MrsM. and her lawyer, Dr A., had already left the courtroom, the presiding magistrate changed the date of a future hearing, which had already been fixed. As a consequence, Mrs M. was not aware of the new date and was not present at the hearing. In her absence, on 29 November 1985 the presiding magistrate issued the injunction in favour of Mr F. 13.According to Maltese law as it stood at the time, Mr F. had to institute proceedings in respect of the property claim preserved by the warrant within four days of the issuing of the injunction; otherwise the injunction would cease to have effect. Accordingly, on 5 December 1985, Mr F. lodged a writ of summons to start proceedings. 14.On 6 March 1992 the relevant court trying the merits of Mr F.’s civil action found against Mrs M. and issued a permanent injunction against her. On 24 March 1992, as no appeal had been lodged, the case became final. 15.On 6 December 1985 Mrs M. instituted proceedings before the (First Hall) in its ordinary jurisdiction, claiming that the injunction had been issued in her absence and without giving her the opportunity to testify (see paragraph 77 below). 16.By a judgment of 15 October 1990, the upheld her claim. It held that the audi alteram partem principle was applicable to the procedure for issuing an injunction. Referring to Article 873 § 2 of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure, which stated that an injunction should not be issued unless the court was satisfied that it was necessary in order to preserve any right of the person seeking it (see paragraph 27 below), the Civil Court held that the relevant test was a matter for the court’s discretion. However, if the court found it necessary to hear the parties, they should be duly heard in accordance with the principles of natural justice. In the present case the court held that, through no fault of her own, Mrs M. had been denied her right to be heard and therefore the said warrant was null and void. 17.Mr F. appealed against the judgment of 15 October 1990. In the first-instance proceedings Mr F. had been assisted by Dr U., while at the appeal stage he had appointed the latter’s son, Dr C. The Court of Appeal was presided over by the Chief Justice, who sat with two other judges. The Chief Justice was Dr U.’s brother and Dr C.’s uncle. 18.At the appeal hearing of 12 October 1992, the Chief Justice, after asking some questions, alleged that the conduct of Dr A. was unethical, as he had impugned, without justification, the conduct of Mr F’s lawyer. When it was noted that in the first-instance proceedings Mr F. had been represented by the Chief Justice’s brother, the Chief Justice threatened to refer the case to “the competent authorities”. Furthermore, he dictated a note to this effect, which read as follows: “The court is asking Dr A., who himself is declaring that the date of the hearing at first instance had been changed when he and his client had already left the courtroom, why he insisted that the said change of date occurred consequent to a request by a lawyer. Dr A.’s reply is: ‘I deduce so, as there were two lawyers present: Dr U. and myself.’ ... Mrs M.’s lawyer asserts facts and has no problem hypothesising about the behaviour of another lawyer and the judge, after he and his client had walked out of the courtroom.” 19.Dr A. said a few words in his own defence, but no oral submissions regarding the merits of the appeal were heard. The Chief Justice suspended the hearing and went to his chambers. A few minutes later the lawyers of both parties were called into the Chief Justice’s chambers. Explanations were heard and no further action appears to have been taken. 20.By a judgment of 5 February 1993, the Court of Appeal found against Mrs M. and reversed the judgment of the . It held that principles of natural justice were not mandatory and could not be invoked in preliminary proceedings that were essentially conditional and of a temporary nature. Moreover, the Court of Appeal did not agree with the issue of fact mentioned in the first-instance judgment, in respect of the change in date leading to Mrs M.’s absence at the hearing. In this respect the judgment repeated in part the note which had been dictated during the hearing – “Mrs M.’s lawyer asserts facts and has no problem hypothesising about the behaviour of another lawyer and the judge, after he and his client had walked out of the courtroom”. The Court of Appeal further ordered the removal from the records of the case of a report which supported Mrs M.’s claim, which had been drawn up by the judicial assistant appointed by the . 21.On 25 March 1993 Mrs M. instituted proceedings before the (First Hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction. Relying on Article 6 of the Convention, she alleged that the President of the Court of Appeal (the Chief Justice) lacked objective impartiality and that this had been manifest in the incident of 12 October 1992. Observing that the Court of Appeal had denied facts which had already been proved, she further submitted that her right to a fair trial had been violated. 22.Mrs M. died on 20 January 2002, before her constitutional claim could be determined. On 22 May 2002 the applicant intervened in the proceedings before the in his capacity as brother of the plaintiff. 23.In a judgment of 29 January 2004, the dismissed MrsM.’s claim as frivolous and vexatious. Although it noted that the plaintiff had failed to request the Chief Justice to withdraw from the case before the pronouncement of the final judgment, it rejected the Government’s plea of non-exhaustion of ordinary remedies and decided to exercise its constitutional jurisdiction. As to the merits, it made a thorough analysis of the notions and rights emanating from Article 6 of the Convention, including equality of arms, but placed particular emphasis on the requirement of impartiality of the . However, it was unable to find any link between the incident of 12 October 1992 and the content of the judgment of 5 February 1993. As confirmed by Dr A. himself, the incident had been defused; however, this could not have given Mrs M. or her lawyer any expectation that the Court of Appeal would rule in her favour. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal was composed of two other judges, who had not been involved in the incident, and there had been no doubt that the judgment, which appeared to be well-reasoned, had been delivered by the bench as a whole. 24.The applicant appealed to the . 25.By a judgment of 24 October 2005, the declared the appeal inadmissible. It reiterated that in accordance with Article 46 § 5 of the Constitution, no appeal lay against a decision dismissing an application as frivolous and vexatious. 26.Article 403 of the Civil Code reads as follows: “(1)Tenements at a lower level are subject in regard to tenements at a higher level to receive such waters and materials as flow or fall naturally therefrom without the agency of man. (2)It shall not be lawful for the owner of the lower tenement to do anything which may prevent such flow or fall. (3)Nor shall it be lawful for the owner of the higher tenement to do anything whereby the easement of the lower tenement is rendered more burdensome.” 27.Article 873 of Title VI, Sub-Title V of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure, regarding warrants of prohibitory injunction, reads as follows: “(1)The object of a warrant of prohibitory injunction is to restrain a person from doing anything whatsoever which might be prejudicial to the person suing out the warrant. (2)The court shall not issue any such warrant unless it is satisfied that such warrant is necessary in order to preserve any right of the person suing out the warrant, and that prima facie such person appears to possess such right.” 28.Under Maltese law, as it stood at the time of the present case, a judge could be challenged or could abstain from hearing a case if one of the parties was represented by the former’s son or daughter, spouse or ascendant. Nothing prevented a judge from sitting in a case if the representative in issue was his or her brother or nephew. The pertinent Articles of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure, in so far as relevant, read as follows: Article 733 “The judges may not be challenged, nor may they abstain from sitting in any cause brought before the court in which they are appointed to sit, except for any of the reasons hereinafter mentioned.” Article 734 “(1)A judge may be challenged or abstain from sitting in a cause – ... (e)if he, or his spouse, is directly or indirectly interested in the event of the suit; (f)if the advocate or legal procurator pleading before a judge is the son or daughter, spouse or ascendant of the said judge; ...” 29.The relevant Article of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure was amended in 2007 to include another ground: “(g)if the advocate or legal procurator pleading before a judge is the brother or sister of the said judge; ...” 30.Article 39 § 2 of the Maltese Constitution, in so far as relevant, reads as follows: “Any court or other adjudicating authority prescribed by law for the determination of the existence or the extent of civil rights or obligations shall be independent and impartial; ...” 31.On the basis of the material available to the Court in respect of the legislation of a relevant number of member States of the Council of Europe, it appears that there is widespread consensus on the applicability of Article6 safeguards to interim measures, including injunction proceedings. This conclusion is inferred from constitutional texts, codes of civil procedure and domestic case-law. In the majority of States (Albania, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, SanMarino, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) legislation suggests that Article 6 procedural safeguards (particularly the impartiality requirement) apply to interim and injunction proceedings either because the legislation makes no distinction as to the stage or type of proceedings to which the safeguards apply (such as the Constitutions of Greece, Italy, Spain and Switzerland), or because specific provisions governing interim measures reflect in some way the main safeguards embedded in Article 6 – as, for example, legislation which specifies that provisions governing proceedings on the merits apply mutatis mutandis to injunction proceedings (such as Poland), or will do so, unless otherwise stipulated (such as Germany). The Belgian courts have explicitly dealt with the issue (see the judgments of the Court of Cassation in the cases of Greenpeace Belgium and Global Action in the Interest of Animals, of 14January 2005) and held that Article 6 of the Convention was in principle applicable to interim proceedings (référé). 32.Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union guarantees the right to a fair trial. Unlike Article 6 of the Convention, the provision of the Charter does not confine this right to disputes relating to “civil rights and obligations” or to “any criminal charge” and does not refer to the “determination” of such. In Bernard Denilauler v. SNC Couchet Frères (ECJ, Case C125/79, 21 May 1980) the European Court of Justice (“the ECJ”) held that provisional measures given ex parte without hearing the defendant could not be recognised according to its case-law. This implies that such safeguards should apply also outside the context of final decisions.",2009,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

28,001-58276,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicants, MrFikret Başkaya and Mr Mehemet Selim Okçuoğlu, are Turkish citizens. The first applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Ankara. He is a professor of economics and a journalist. The second applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Istanbul. He is the owner of a publishing house, Doz Basin Yayin Ltd Sti. 10.In April 1991 Doz Basin Yayin Ltd Sti published a book written bythe first applicant and entitled Batılılaşma, Çağdaşlaşma, Kalkınma – Paradigmanın İflası/Resmi İdeolojinin Eleştirisine Giriş (“Westernisation, Modernisation, Development – Collapse of a Paradigm/An Introduction to the Critique of the Official Ideology”). The book was an academic essay of 219 pages, containing 370 references, which involved a description of the socio-economic evolution of Turkey since the 1920s and the analysis and criticism of the “official ideology” of the State. According to the titles listed in the table of contents, the author dealt with the following topics: Intelligentsia and Official Ideology; The Characteristics of the National Struggle; The Question of the National Character of the National Struggle; The Comintern and whether the National Struggle was Anti-Imperialist; Mustafa Kemal and the Individual’s Role in History; The Characteristics of the Kemalist Regime: an Original Form of Bonapartism; Productive Forces and Economic Policies; Bonapartist Regime and Accumulation of Capital; A Classless, Privilegeless, Populist Dictatorship; The Evolution of Socio-Economic Formation in the Neo-Colonialist Era; The Eighties: Strengthening of the Satellitisation Process; The Collapse of the Paradigm and the Science of Economics: Means to Legitimise Existing Tendencies. 11.The impugned chapter of the book included the following passages: “The Kurdish problem plays a significant role in the analysis of the evolution of Milli Mücadele [Turkish National Independence War (1919-1922)] and Turkish social formation. The Kurdish problem and the process of the colonisation of Kurdistan are indeed very important and, as such, should be the subject-matter of another book. Moreover, the problem is not only related to Turkey. The formation of the domestic politics of four States in the region (Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria) (type of political regimes) as well as the ‘unique’ nature of relationships between these four neighbouring States make it a complicated issue. We have two reasons why we wish to discuss the problem, even if in limited form, within the plan and scope of this book. These are to indicate the ‘irrationality’ of official ideology and the real nature of Milli Mücadele. In other words, [we wish] to discuss whether what is presented as ‘Kurtuluş Savaşı’ [Independence War] is in reality an ‘Independence Movement’ or not. Without any doubt, the imprisonment of Kurdistan (if the small area within the borders of the Soviet Union is omitted) within the borders of four different States gives the imperialists too easily ‘control’ over these four States. Although the Kurdish problem is of great importance with regard to the protection of the imperialist status quo in the region, we shall not here go into an analysis of this aspect of the problem. [page 51] ... On the other hand, the racist policy of denial which has been followed with regard to the Kurds since the foundation of the Republic [1923] has also been an important factor in the development of the fascist movement in Turkey. As a contradiction, even though ‘the assumption of non-existence’ of the Kurdish Nation constitutes an important element of the official ideology, this is at the same time the weakest point of the ideology in question. It is not possible ‘to eliminate with the mind’ a nation which exists and the objective reality continues to exist regardless of the nonsense and unfounded suspicions of the people. Of course, this does not mean that the nonsense, unfounded suspicions have no effect! There is never a lack of those who profit from it, acquire bureaucratic, academic careers, receive high salaries, go up the step ladder of the political arena ... [page 52] ... It was believed that colonialism would come to an end with the abolishment of direct political-military-police control in the colonies. Today, however, the [natural] resources of the Third World are carried to imperialist countries in volumes which are much higher than those of the colonial period. Therefore, the relationship between the Turkish State and Kurdistan is not of an imperialist devouring category. One can speak of a situation which also directly embodies a political, military, cultural, ideological oppression. Thus, a direct colony status is in force. [page 59]” 12.It appears that the publication of the book came to the notice of the prosecution authorities on 3 May 1991. 13.On 2 August 1991 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court (İstanbul Devlet Güvenlik Mahkemesi), having regard to the contents of the book in question, issued an indictment against the applicants. The first applicant, as the author of the book, was charged under section8(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (“the 1991 Act”) with disseminating propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. The second applicant, as the owner of the publishing company, was charged under section 8(2) of the 1991 Act. In the bill of indictment, the public prosecutor quoted extracts from the chapter of the book reproduced at paragraph 11 above. 14.In the proceedings before the National Security Court, the applicants denied the charges and sought their acquittal. The first applicant submitted that his book had been an academic work that could not be viewed as propaganda. Being a professor he had had the duty to conduct research and publish his conclusions and could not be forced to accept the “official version of reality”. His book might be judged by academics, but not by the courts. It could not be permissible to try and convict someone for the expression of his or her opinion. The second applicant submitted, inter alia, that it was not possible to make an assessment of the book as a whole solely on the basis of extracts from a single chapter. He alleged that section 8 of the 1991 Act was inconsistent with the Turkish Constitution and Turkey’s international obligations. There was a “Kurdish problem” in Turkey and commenting or expressing ideas on this problem could not constitute an offence. 15.In a final statement dated 18 March 1992, the public prosecutor requested the conviction of the first applicant under section 8(1) of the 1991 Act and that of the second applicant under section 8(2), as well as the confiscation of all copies of the book. The public prosecutor considered that the offence had been committed on 3 May 1991. 16.On 14 October 1992 the court acquitted the applicants. It held that the book as a whole was an academic work containing no elements of propaganda. 17.The public prosecutor appealed. He submitted that the book alleged that a certain part of Turkish territory had belonged to “Kurdistan” which the Turks had annexed and colonised. Concluding that the book did indeed disseminate propaganda against the indivisibility of the State, he requested that the verdict be set aside. 18.On 4 February 1993 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the trial court and referred the case back for retrial. It gave the following reasons: “In the writings on pages 51 to 59 of the book … it is stated that a part of the territory within the borders of the Turkish Republic is a part of Kurdistan which belongs to the Kurdish nation, and that this territory has been annexed by the Turks and is subject to colony status. The Istanbul National Security Court, without considering that [the above] statement, as such, exceeds the limits of criticism and constitutes dissemination of propaganda against the indivisible integrity of the State of the Turkish Republic with its territory and nation, found [both] accused ‘not guilty’. The judgment … is contrary to the law and thus, the public prosecutor’s grounds of appeal are upheld. Accordingly, it is unanimously decided that the judgment be reversed …” 19.In a judgment dated 5 August 1993, the Istanbul National Security Court found the applicants guilty of the offences with which they had been charged. It sentenced the first applicant to two years’ imprisonment and a fine of 50,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) and the second applicant to six months’ imprisonment and a fine of TRL 50,000,000. Considering the applicants’ good conduct during the trial, the court reduced the first applicant’s sentence to one year and eight months’ imprisonment and a fine of TRL 41,666,666 and the second applicant’s sentence to five months’ imprisonment and a fine of TRL 41,666,666. On the other hand, the court dismissed the public prosecutor’s request for an order of confiscation of the book. In its reasoning supporting the convictions, the court stated: “After the examination of the book which is the subject of the offence, it is understood that the [following] statements on page 51 that ‘The Kurdish problem plays a significant role in the analysis of the evolution of Milli Mücadele [Turkish National Independence War (1919-1922)] and Turkish social formation. The Kurdish problem and the process of the colonisation of Kurdistan are indeed very important and, as such, should be the subject-matter of another book. Moreover, the problem is not only related to Turkey. The formation of the domestic politics of four States in the region (Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria) ...’, ‘to discuss whether what is presented as “Kurtuluş Savaşı” [Independence War] is in reality an “Independence Movement” or not. Without any doubt, the imprisonment of Kurdistan (if the small area within the borders of the Soviet Union is omitted) within the borders of four different States gives the imperialists too easily “control” over these four States ...’, on page 52 that ‘the racist policy of denial which has been followed with regard to the Kurds since the foundation of the Republic [1923] has also been an important factor in the development of the fascist movement in Turkey... It is not possible “to eliminate with the mind” a nation which exists ...’ and on page 59 that ‘the relationship between the Turkish State and Kurdistan is not of an imperialist devouring category. One can speak of a situation which also directly embodies a political, military, cultural, ideological oppression. Thus, a direct colony status is in force.’ identify a certain part of the Turkish Republic as Kurdistan, declare that the Turkish Republic rules this region with colony status and thus aim to disseminate propaganda against the indivisible integrity of the State of the Turkish Republic with its territory and nation. Therefore, the following sentence shall be drafted under the provisions of Law no. 3713 which is applicable to the proven acts of the accused.” 20.The applicants appealed to the Court of Cassation, which held a hearing in the case. The applicants, while reiterating the defence made before the National Security Court, emphasised that the latter had failed to consider the book as a whole and had erroneously based its decision on an assessment of one chapter. The first applicant maintained that section 8 of the 1991 Act was inconsistent with the Turkish Constitution and the Convention, and he could not therefore be tried and convicted under that provision. He also referred to his previous arguments concerning the lack of clarity of the relevant provisions of the 1991 Act. The second applicant asserted that his sentence to imprisonment had been unlawful in that section8(2) only authorised the imposition of a fine. 21.In its decision of 16 December 1993, delivered on 22December1993, the Court of Cassation upheld the National Security Court’s findings and dismissed the appeals. 22.As of 18 March 1994 the first applicant was dismissed, under section98(2) of the Civil Servants Act (Law no. 367), from his post as lecturer at the University of Ankara. The relevant decision referred to his conviction under the 1991 Act and to his being sentenced to twenty months’ imprisonment. 23.On 3 October 1997 the National Security Court granted a request by the prosecution for an order of seizure in respect of the sixth edition of the impugned book. 24.The applicants served their sentences in prison and paid the fines. After the amendments made by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995 to the 1991 Act, the Istanbul National Security Court re-examined the second applicant’s case. On 19 April 1996 the court held that these amendments could not be applied to his case as he had already served his sentence. 25.The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows: Article 2 § 2 “Where the legislative provisions in force at the time when a crime is committed are different from those of a later law, the provisions most favourable to the offender shall be applied.” Article 36 § 1 “In the event of conviction, the court shall order the seizure and confiscation of any object which has been used for the commission or preparation of the crime or offence …” 26.The relevant provisions of the Press Act 1950 read as follows: Section 3 “For the purposes of the present Law, the term ‘periodicals’ shall mean newspapers, press agency dispatches and any other printed matter published at regular intervals. ‘Publication’ shall mean the exposure, display, distribution, emission, sale or offer for sale of printed matter on premises to which the public have access where anyone may see it. An offence shall not be deemed to have been committed through the medium of the press unless publication has taken place, except where the material in itself is unlawful.” 27.The relevant provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 read as follows: Section 8 (before amendment by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “[(1)]Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited, irrespective of the methods used and the intention. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than two and not more than five years’ imprisonment and a fine of from fifty million to one hundred million Turkish liras. [(2)]Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the above paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched[]. However the fine may not be less than one hundred million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical concerned shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher and sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment.” Section 8 (as amended by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “[(1)]Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than one and not more than three years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras. The penalty imposed on a reoffender may not be commuted to a fine. [(2)]Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly. However, the fine may not be less than one hundred million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical concerned shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher and sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment. [(3)]Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of printed matter or by means of mass communication other than periodicals within the meaning of the second paragraph, those responsible and the owners of the means of mass communication shall be sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras … …” The Government have submitted case-law concerning the application of section 8, details of which may be found in Karataş v. Turkey [GC], no.23168/94, § 22, ECHR 1999-IV. Section 13 (before amendment by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “The penalties for the offences contemplated in the present Law may not be commuted to a fine or any other measure, nor may they be accompanied by a reprieve.” Section 13 (as amended by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “The penalties for the offences contemplated in the present Law may not be commuted to a fine or any other measure, nor may they be accompanied by a reprieve. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply to convictions pursuant to section 8.” 28.A summary of the relevant domestic law governing the organisation and procedure of the National Security Courts is contained in Karataş cited above, §§ 24-29.",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION.
V.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 §§ 1 AND 2 AND ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION
81.  BEFORE THE COMMISSION, THE FIRST APPLICANT COMPLAINED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A BREACH OF HIS RIGHT TO A FAIR HEARING UNDER ARTICLE 6 § 1 IN THAT THE DOMESTIC COURTS HAD FAILED TO CONSIDER HIS BOOK AS A WHOLE. MOREOVER, REFERRING TO THE SAME MATTERS AS WITH REGARD TO HIS COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE 7, HE ALSO ALLEGED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A VIOLATION OF HIS RIGHT UNDER ARTICLE 6 § 2 TO BE PRESUMED INNOCENT OF A CRIMINAL OFFENCE UNTIL PROVED GUILTY. THE COMMISSION FOUND IT UNNECESSARY TO EXAMINE THESE ALLEGATIONS, IN VIEW OF ITS CONCLUSIONS ON THE OTHER CONVENTION ISSUES RAISED.
THE COURT FURTHER NOTES THAT AT THE COMMISSION STAGE THE SECOND APPLICANT, REFERRING BASICALLY TO THE SAME FACTS AS IN HIS COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE 10, ALLEGED A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FORMER ARTICLE. THE COMMISSION CONCLUDED THAT NO SEPARATE ISSUE AROSE UNDER THESE PROVISIONS TAKEN TOGETHER.
HOWEVER, THE APPLICANTS DID NOT MENTION THE ABOVE COMPLAINTS BEFORE THE COURT, WHICH DOES NOT CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THEM OF ITS OWN MOTION.
VI.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION
82.  THE APPLICANTS CLAIMED COMPENSATION FOR PECUNIARY AND NONPECUNIARY DAMAGE AS WELL AS REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE DOMESTIC AND THE CONVENTION PROCEEDINGS. ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION PROVIDES:
“IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION OR THE PROTOCOLS THERETO, AND IF THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTY CONCERNED ALLOWS ONLY PARTIAL REPARATION TO BE MADE, THE COURT SHALL, IF NECESSARY, AFFORD JUST SATISFACTION TO THE INJURED PARTY.”
A.  PECUNIARY DAMAGE
83.  THE FIRST APPLICANT CLAIMED 500,000 FRENCH FRANCS (FRF) IN COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF EARNINGS AND OF RETIREMENT BONUS RESULTING FROM THE FACT THAT, BECAUSE OF THE TERMINATION OF HIS APPOINTMENT, HE WAS FORCED TO RETIRE AT THE AGE OF 54, THIRTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE NORMAL AGE OF RETIREMENT.
HE ALSO CLAIMED FRF 420,000 IN COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF INCOME FROM THE SALES OF HIS BOOK, CORRESPONDING TO 15% OF THE ESTIMATED RETURN FROM THE SALE OF 70,000 COPIES. AT THE TIME WHEN THE BOOK WAS BANNED AND A CONFISCATION ORDER WAS IMPOSED, 30,000 COPIES HAD BEEN PRINTED, WHEREAS 70,000 MORE COPIES WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN MADE.
84.  THE SECOND APPLICANT, REFERRING TO THE FIRST APPLICANT’S CALCULATIONS, CLAIMED COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF 20% IN PROFITS FROM THE SALE OF THE BOOK. IN THE LIGHT OF THE CALCULATIONS MADE BY THE FIRST APPLICANT, THE SECOND APPLICANT’S LOSS COULD BE ESTIMATED AS AMOUNTING TO APPROXIMATELY FRF 440,000.
85.  BOTH APPLICANTS IN ADDITION SOUGHT COMPENSATION IN AN AMOUNT CORRESPONDING TO THE 41,666,666 TURKISH LIRAS THEY HAD EACH PAID IN FINES. ACCORDING TO THE FIRST APPLICANT THIS CORRESPONDED TO FRF 7,400.
86.  THE GOVERNMENT CONTESTED THE ABOVE CLAIMS. THEY DISPUTED THAT THE FIRST APPLICANT HAD SUSTAINED ANY ECONOMIC LOSS AS A RESULT OF HIS EARLY RETIREMENT. HE HAD BEEN RECEIVING A SUBSTANTIAL PENSION SINCE 1998. IN ANY EVENT, NOTHING WOULD HAVE PREVENTED HIM FROM SEEKING ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT, WHICH IS CUSTOMARY FOR EARLY RETIREES IN TURKEY.
AS REGARDS THE CLAIMS RELATED TO THE ALLEGED LOSS OF INCOME FROM SALES OF THE BOOK, THE SUGGESTION THAT IT WOULD HAVE SOLD 100,000 COPIES WAS ENTIRELY UNFOUNDED. EVEN THE BEST-SELLING BOOKS IN TURKEY DO NOT REACH AS HIGH A LEVEL OF CIRCULATION.
87.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT MAKE ANY COMMENTS IN THIS CONNECTION.
88.  THE COURT IS SATISFIED THAT THERE WAS A SUFFICIENT CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN THE ALLEGED PECUNIARY DAMAGE AND THE VIOLATIONS FOUND OF THE FIRST AND SECOND APPLICANTS’ RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 10 AND THE SECOND APPLICANT’S RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 7. THE FINES IMPOSED ON THE APPLICANTS AND PAID BY THEM SHOULD BE REIMBURSED IN THEIR ENTIRETY. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE COURT DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT THE EVIDENCE SUBMITTED LENDS ITSELF TO A PRECISE QUANTIFICATION OF THE FIRST APPLICANT’S LOSS OF EARNINGS RESULTING FROM HIS DISMISSAL BY THE UNIVERSITY OR HIS AND THE SECOND APPLICANT’S LOSS OF PROSPECTIVE INCOME FROM FUTURE SALES OF THE IMPUGNED BOOK. MAKING AN OVERALL ASSESSMENT ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS, THE COURT AWARDS THE FIRST APPLICANT FRF 67,400 AND THE SECOND APPLICANT FRF 17,400 IN RESPECT OF PECUNIARY DAMAGE.
B.  NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE
89.  THE FIRST APPLICANT, MR BAŞKAYA, REQUESTED FRF 1,000,000 IN COMPENSATION FOR THE SUFFERING CAUSED BY HIS CONVICTION AND BY HIS HAVING SERVED FIFTEEN OF HIS TWENTY MONTHS’ SENTENCE TO IMPRISONMENT. WHILE HE HAD LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS OF FURTHER ADVANCEMENT IN HIS ACADEMIC CAREER, THESE MEASURES HAD RESULTED IN THE TERMINATION OF HIS EMPLOYMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY. THE MEASURES HAD NOT ONLY SEVERELY AFFECTED HIS LIFE AS AN ACADEMIC AND INTELLECTUAL BUT HAD ALSO DEPRIVED HIM OF THE POSSIBILITY OF TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS AND STANDING FOR ELECTION.
90.  THE SECOND APPLICANT, WITHOUT SPECIFYING AN AMOUNT, CLAIMED COMPENSATION FOR THE DAMAGE WHICH HE HAD SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS, HIS CONVICTION AND IMPRISONMENT.
91.  FOR THE GOVERNMENT THE FINDING OF A VIOLATION WOULD CONSTITUTE ADEQUATE JUST SATISFACTION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION, THE ALLEGATIONS OF SUFFERING BEING UNSUBSTANTIATED AND THE AMOUNT CLAIMED, IN THE CASE OF THE FIRST APPLICANT, BEING MORE THAN EXCESSIVE.
92.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT OFFER ANY COMMENTS.
93.  THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT BOTH APPLICANTS MUST HAVE SUFFERED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DISTRESS WHICH CANNOT BE COMPENSATED SOLELY BY THE COURT’S FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS. THE COURT, HAVING REGARD TO THE NATURE OF THE VIOLATIONS FOUND IN THE PRESENT CASE AND DECIDING ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS, AWARDS THE FIRST APPLICANT FRF 40,000 AND THE SECOND APPLICANT FRF 45,000 UNDER THE HEAD OF NONPECUNIARY DAMAGE.
C.  COSTS AND EXPENSES
94.  THE FIRST APPLICANT SOUGHT THE REIMBURSEMENT OF FRF 250,000, APPARENTLY IN RESPECT OF COSTS IN THE DOMESTIC PROCEEDINGS, AND FRF 100,000, SEEMINGLY IN RESPECT OF COSTS BEFORE THE CONVENTION INSTITUTIONS.
95.  THE SECOND APPLICANT ASKED THE COURT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HIS AGREEMENT WITH HIS LAWYER TO PAY HER 25,000 US DOLLARS.
96.  THE GOVERNMENT STATED THAT THE AMOUNT CLAIMED WAS EXAGGERATED IN COMPARISON WITH FEES EARNED BY TURKISH LAWYERS IN THE DOMESTIC COURTS AND HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY JUSTIFIED.
97.  THE DELEGATE OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT COMMENT.
98.  THE COURT WILL CONSIDER THE ABOVE CLAIMS IN THE LIGHT OF THE CRITERIA LAID DOWN IN ITS CASE-LAW, NAMELY WHETHER THE COSTS AND EXPENSES WERE ACTUALLY AND NECESSARILY INCURRED IN ORDER TO PREVENT OR OBTAIN REDRESS FOR THE MATTER FOUND TO CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION AND WERE REASONABLE AS TO QUANTUM. AS TO THE LATTER, IT DOES NOT REGARD ITSELF BOUND BY DOMESTIC SCALES AND PRACTICES, ALTHOUGH IT MAY DERIVE SOME ASSISTANCE FROM THEM (SEE, AMONG MANY OTHER AUTHORITIES, THE TOLSTOY MILOSLAVSKY V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT OF 13 JULY 1995, SERIES A NO. 316-B, P. 83, § 77, AND NIKOLOVA V. BULGARIA [GC], NO. 31195/96, § 79, ECHR 1999-II). TO A LARGE DEGREE, THE COURT SHARES THE GOVERNMENT’S VIEWS THAT THE CLAIMS MADE ARE UNSUBSTANTIATED AND EXCESSIVE. THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO AS REGARDS THOSE OF THE SECOND APPLICANT, WHO DID NOT SUBMIT A MEMORIAL TO THE COURT ON THE MERITS OF HIS CASE. DECIDING ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS, THE COURT AWARDS THE FIRST AND SECOND APPLICANTS RESPECTIVELY FRF 22,000 AND FRF 15,000 UNDER THE HEAD OF COSTS AND EXPENSES.
D.  DEFAULT INTEREST
99.  THE COURT DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE TO ADOPT THE STATUTORY RATE OF INTEREST APPLICABLE IN FRANCE AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF THE PRESENT JUDGMENT, WHICH IS 3.47 % PER ANNUM.
FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT
1.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION TO EXAMINE THE FIRST APPLICANT’S COMPLAINTS UNDER ARTICLES 3 AND 14 OF THE CONVENTION;
2.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE CONVENTION WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST APPLICANT;
3.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE CONVENTION WITH RESPECT TO THE SECOND APPLICANT;
4.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION WITH RESPECT TO BOTH APPLICANTS;
5.	DISMISSES UNANIMOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT’S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION CONCERNING THE EXHAUSTION OF DOMESTIC REMEDIES IN RELATION TO THE APPLICANTS’ COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION;
6.	HOLDS BY SIXTEEN VOTES TO ONE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION AS REGARDS THE COMPLAINT RELATING TO THE INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY OF THE ISTANBUL NATIONAL SECURITY COURT;
7.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE APPLICANTS’ FURTHER COMPLAINTS UNDER RESPECTIVELY ARTICLE 6 §§ 1 AND 2 OF THE CONVENTION AND ARTICLE 14 TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 10;
8.	HOLDS UNANIMOUSLY
(A)	THAT THE RESPONDENT STATE IS TO PAY THE FIRST AND SECOND APPLICANTS, WITHIN THREE MONTHS, THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS, TO BE CONVERTED INTO TURKISH LIRAS AT THE RATE APPLICABLE ON THE DATE OF SETTLEMENT:
(B)	THAT SIMPLE INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 3.47% SHALL BE PAYABLE ON THESE SUMS FROM THE EXPIRY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED THREE MONTHS UNTIL SETTLEMENT;
9.	DISMISSES UNANIMOUSLY THE REMAINDER OF THE APPLICANTS’ CLAIMS FOR JUST SATISFACTION.
"
87,001-58120,Grand Chamber,"11.The applicants, MsAzize Menteş, MsMahile Turhallı and MsSulhiye Turhallı and MsSariye Uvat are Turkish citizens of Kurdish origin from the village of Sağgöz (which is the official Turkish name) or Riz (which is the older, Kurdish or Ottoman name) in the Genç district in the province of Bingöl in south-east Turkey. At present they live in Diyarbakır. 12.Since approximately 1985, serious disturbances have raged in the south-east of Turkey between the security forces and the members of the PKK (Workers’ Party of Kurdistan). This confrontation has so far, according to the Government, claimed the lives of 4,036 civilians and 3,884 members of the security forces. At the time of the Court’s consideration of the case, ten of the eleven provinces of south-eastern Turkey had since 1987 been subjected to emergency rule. 13.Sağgöz is situated in a mountainous area which was subject to significant PKK terrorist activity. Due to the events in the region in 1993 and1994, many of the villages in the district have been evacuated by the villagers and the houses destroyed. By the summer of 1994, the village of Sağgöz and its surrounding hamlets were deserted, the villagers having left for Diyarbakır, Genç and other places, and the houses ruined. 14.The Sağgöz village was evacuated as a whole by the villagers in or about October 1993, following pressure from the PKK in the area. Some of the villagers in the outer hamlets stayed beyond October1993 but had all left by summer1994 due to PKK presence. Shortly after the villagers began leaving, the PKK moved into the empty houses. Clashes with security forces ensued, one in October or November1993, another in April/May1994. It is probable that houses in the village were burned or destroyed in the course of these clashes, including possibly through bombing from helicopters. However, whether the PKK or the security forces set fire to the houses intentionally or accidentally is not established. 15.The facts in this case are disputed. 16.According to the applicants their houses were burned in the course of an operation by the security forces in June1993. Their version of the events could be summarised as follows. 17.The applicants all lived in hamlets of the village of Sağgöz. AzizeMenteş, Mahile Turhallı and Sulhiye Turhallı lived in the lower neighbourhood in Sağgöz village and Sariye Uvat lived in Piroz, a separate hamlet of the village. 18.On 23June 1993, an attack was carried out by the PKK on Üçdamlar gendarme station. On the evening of the same day, the security forces stopped a minibus belonging to Naif Akgül, which regularly took people between Diyarbakır and the Lice area, as it approached the gendarme station. The security forces set fire to the minibus. They subsequently carried out a followup operation in pursuit of the PKK who had attacked the station. On 24June 1993, security forces came to Pecar (Güldiken) village and burned some of the houses. 19.On the evening of 24June 1993, security forces arrived in the area surrounding Sağgöz village by helicopter. On the morning of 25June1993, gendarmes entered the village and gathered people from the upper neighbourhood in the area in front of the school. Gendarmes in the lower area carried out a search and then proceeded to burn houses in the lower neighbourhood of Sağgöz village. Villagers pleaded with the gendarmes not to burn their houses but were told to remain quiet or they would be thrown on the flames. When asked why they were burning the houses, the gendarmes told the villagers that it was a punishment for helping the PKK. 20.The house where Azize Menteş lived was burned completely, along with her furniture, firewood, barn and a shed with winter feed for the animals. Mahile Turhallı’s house was burned and the gendarmes threatened to throw her into the burning house if she tried to retrieve some of her children’s clothes. Sulhiye Turhallı’s house was burned, after she and her children had been thrown out and she had been kicked, cursed at and a gun put to her face. In all, ten to thirteen houses in the lower neighbourhood were destroyed. The soldiers told the applicants that they were burning their houses because they helped the terrorists. 21.The intention of the gendarmes in Sağgöz village appeared to have been to burn the whole village in revenge for the attack by the PKK on the gendarme station. However, the arrival of a commanding officer at midday, a colonel who ordered the burning to stop, saved the upper village. The house of the applicant Sariye Uvat in the hamlet of Piroz was burned by the security forces in a separate incident. The applicants were forced to leave Sağgöz. 22.Later, in the autumn of 1993, the remaining population of the village left and in March1994 the remainder of the village was burned down. By this date in 1994, the entire area seems to have been burned, devastated and depopulated. 23.The burning of the applicants’ homes is consistent with a practice of burning houses as part of the policy by the security forces to combat the PKK, especially where the authorities view villages as giving support to the PKK. 24.Since 1983 the PKK has sought to use the applicants’ village as a place of shelter and supply base. The villagers were forced by virtue of the incursions of the terrorists to leave the village. The terrorists used the houses from time to time and when the security forces took action against them, the terrorists fled setting the houses on fire. 25.There were no operations by the security forces in the area on 25June 1993. In fact, the applicants had been absent from the village for six to seven years by that point. They were the close relatives of six named individuals who are suspected of being members of the mountains branch of the PKK. They also had relatives who had been detained on charges alleging, inter alia, that they have aided and abetted the PKK terrorist organisation. Other members of the applicants’ families were working for the PKK in rural areas. It was not unlikely that the applicants had been subjected to pressure by their relatives who aid and abet and work for the PKK. 26.The Commission conducted an investigation, with the assistance of the parties, and accepted documentary evidence, including written statements, and oral evidence of eleven witnesses taken by three delegates of the Commission in Ankara from 10 to 12July 1995. This included two local public prosecutors and four villagers whom they had investigated in connection with the applicants’ allegations (see paragraphs 27–30 below); another villager; the first three applicants; and the commander of the gendarmerie of the Bingöl province who had taken up his duties after the alleged events. In relation to the oral evidence, the Commission had been aware of the difficulties attached to assessing evidence obtained orally through interpreters (in some cases via Kurdish and Turkish into English). It therefore paid careful attention to the meaning and significance which should be attributed to the statements of witnesses appearing before its delegates. In respect of both written and oral evidence, the Commission was aware that the cultural context of the applicants and the witnesses made it inevitable that dates and other details lacked precision (in particular, numerical matters) and did not consider that this by itself impinged on the credibility of the testimony. It assessed the evidence and its findings could be summarised as follows. 27.Two investigations into the events at Sağgöz had been carried out by the two public prosecutors at Genç, the first by Mr Ata Köycü and the second by MrKadir Karaca, both of which had ended in decisions, on 25April and 30May 1994 respectively, not to prosecute. 28.The first investigation had been in response to a letter from the Ministry of Justice, apparently motivated by information received when the applicants’ complaints had been communicated by the Commission to the Turkish Government on 15April 1994 (date of letter). In reconstructing the investigation, the Commission’s delegates had received little assistance from the public prosecutor who had also been handicapped in not having a copy of his file for reference. His decision not to prosecute, which concluded that no incident had occurred on 25June 1993, must have been taken less than two weeks from his receipt of the first notification of the complaints. It seemed likely that the applicants’ names were not known to him at that stage. This decision had been taken solely on the basis of brief statements from four villagers, from different hamlets, distinct from Sağgöz, which appeared mainly directed at refuting specific allegations: the bombing by helicopters in June1993 (not in fact alleged in the applicants’ original application) and the tying up or beating of the old men. All had referred to terrorist clashes with security forces leading to the villagers’ departure from Sağgöz; only one had attributed the burning of houses to the PKK. According to Mr Karaca, the witnesses had been selected at random, but Ekrem Yarar, muhtar of Sağgöz, had said that he had been invited to make a statement and to bring other “reliable witnesses” from the village. 29.Also the second investigation had been in response to another letter from the Ministry of Justice. Mr Karaca had based himself on the investigation of his colleague. He referred to the previous four statements and summoned the four villagers concerned. His decision not to prosecute concluded that the PKK burned the houses in the village, that the alleged incident had not taken place in June1993 and that the applicants were close relatives of members of the PKK. 30.No other steps were taken to establish the facts of what occurred, either by enquiring from the gendarmes as to whether any operation might have taken place or by seeking to question villagers from the upper or lower neighbourhoods of Sağgöz itself. Further, it appeared that, while the names of the applicants were known at the time of the second investigation, no attempt had been made either to find out their addresses or to contact them with a view to inviting them to provide statements as to the factual circumstances of the case. The addresses of the applicants were in fact known to the authorities in Ankara who had been in contact with the police in Diyarbakır. 31.The Commission observed that there had been no detailed investigation at the domestic level of the events in Sağgöz village and its surrounding hamlets over the period June 1993 to summer 1994. It had accordingly based its findings on the evidence given orally before its delegates or submitted in writing in the course of the proceedings. It further noted that the Government, despite repeated requests by the Commission’s Secretariat and the Commission’s delegates, had failed to provide documentary materials, in particular the contents of the investigation files of the two public prosecutors who carried out investigations into the alleged incident in Sağgöz village. At the taking of evidence in July 1995, the Government had failed to identify and serve with the Commission’s summons the gendarme commander for the area on 25 June 1993, his successor, Mr Tuna, appearing instead. No explanation had been forthcoming for this. In this respect, the Commission had had regard to the principle that, in assessing the evidence in a case the conduct of the parties may be taken into account (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18January 1978, SeriesA no.25, p.65, §161 in fine). 32.The Commission was not persuaded by the Government’s suggestion that the applicants’ complaints were fabrications resulting from pressure exerted by their relatives in the PKK. The Commission found it regrettable that the response from the domestic authorities and the Government’s allegations made in this case had given the appearance of being directed more at emphasising the PKK links with the applicants’ families than at dealing with the substance of the applicants’ grievances. 33.In establishing the facts, the Commission had regard to the inconsistencies and contradictions in the evidence. As to the evidence given by the four villagers to the public prosecutors, the Commission observed that its tenor had been dogmatic, including blanket denials of any alleged cruelty or burning ever having been committed by Turkish soldiers. It had also given some support to the applicants’ allegation that there was a certain animosity between the other villagers and themselves, which might have encouraged them to give statements contradicting the applicants’ account. Moreover, the Commission noted that the village muhtar had been instructed by the prosecutor to bring some “reliable witnesses”. In view of the manner of selection of witnesses by the prosecutor, the Commission found it unsafe to rely on their written statements in so far as they were unsupported by other evidence. The Commission further noted that there were material differences between the statements of the first three applicants, MsAzize Menteş, MsMahile Turhallı and MsSulhiye Turhallı, as recorded by the Human Rights Association and their oral statements to the delegates. However, the Commission found that the three applicants’ oral evidence, which was supported in material points by a villager – MsAysel Gündoğan – was on the whole consistent and credible. The fact that they had gone to the Human Rights Association in Diyarbakır to complain in July 1993 was a strong factor weighing heavily in favour of the credibility of their central complaint. On the other hand, the Commission considered that it could not rely on the written statements since it had serious doubts as to the manner in which the association took statements and the extent to which care had been taken to record accurately each individual complaint without contamination from information gathered elsewhere. 34.The Commission was satisfied that Sulhiye and Mahile Turhallı were still living in their houses in the lower neighbourhood of the village of Sağgöz in the summer of 1993 and were present on 25June 1993. However, as appeared to be a not uncommon pattern of life in this region, these two applicants left the village in the winter for Diyarbakır and returned in the summer to tend to their gardens and crops. As regards Azize Menteş, while she probably did not own a house herself, she lived in the house of her fatherin-law when she returned in the summer months to the village. The Commission found that on the balance of the evidence, she was also living in the lower neighbourhood on 25June 1993. As regards the events in Sağgöz the Commission accepted in its principal elements the oral evidence of Azize Menteş, Mahile Turhallı and SulhiyeTurhallı. Considering that their oral evidence was more consistent, more credible and more convincing than the evidence given by the four villagers, it found as follows. On the evening of 24June 1993, a large force of gendarmes had arrived in the vicinity of Sağgöz village. On 25June 1993, the gendarmes had entered both upper and lower neighbourhoods and carried out searches. At some point, the villagers in the upper neighbourhood (with the exception of the younger men who were out working) had been gathered in front of the school, probably to be questioned about the PKK in the area. In the lower neighbourhood, the women, including the applicants, had been required by the soldiers to leave their houses and their houses had been set on fire, with all their belongings and property inside, including the clothing and footwear of children. The burning had been restricted to the lower neighbourhood. Around midday, a helicopter had arrived in the village in the upper neighbourhood, probably bringing a senior officer, a colonel, and his arrival had been associated by the applicants and some of the other villagers with an order to cease the burning. The gendarmes left that day. Shortly afterwards, the three applicants, with their children or other members of their family, had to walk for up to ten hours to the Lice-Diyarbakır road from where they were given rides in vehicles into Diyarbakır. 35.As to the alleged operation by security forces in which the house of the fourth applicant, Sariye Uvat, was burned along with others in the hamlet of Piroz, no facts have been established in relation to this applicant’s complaints. Due to ill-health she did not appear at the hearings before the Commission delegates, unlike the first three applicants. 36.Article125 of the Turkish Constitution provides as follows: “All acts or decisions of the administration are subject to judicial review ... The administration shall be liable to indemnify any damage caused by its own acts and measures.” 37.The above provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war. The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration, whose responsibility is of an absolute, objective nature, based on a concept of collective liability and referred to as the theory of “social risk”. Thus the administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the State may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety, or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property. 38.The principle of administrative liability is reflected in the additional section1 of Law no.2935 of25 October 1983 on the State of Emergency, which provides: “... actions for compensation in relation to the exercise of the powers conferred by this Law are to be brought against the administration before the administrative courts.” 39.The Turkish Criminal Code makes it a criminal offence – to deprive an individual unlawfully of his or her liberty (Article179 generally, Article181 in respect of civil servants); – to oblige an individual through force or threats to commit or not to commit an act (Article188); – to issue threats (Article191); – to make an unlawful search of an individual’s home (Articles193 and 194); – to commit arson (Articles369, 370, 371, 372), or aggravated arson if human life is endangered (Article382); – to commit arson unintentionally by carelessness, negligence or inexperience (Article383); or – to damage another’s property intentionally (Articles526 et seq.). 40.For all these offences complaints may be lodged, pursuant to Articles151 and153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities. The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them, the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated, pursuant to Article148 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings. 41.If the suspected authors of the contested acts are military personnel, they may also be prosecuted for causing extensive damage, endangering human lives or damaging property, if they have not followed orders in conformity with Articles86 and87 of the Military Code. Proceedings in these circumstances may be initiated by the persons concerned (non-military) before the competent authority under the Code of Criminal Procedure, or before the suspected persons’ hierarchical superior (sections93 and95 of Law no.353 on the Constitution and Procedure of Military Courts). 42.If the alleged author of a crime is an agent of the State, permission to prosecute must be obtained from local administrative councils (the Executive Committee of the Provincial Assembly). The local council decisions may be appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court; a refusal to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal of this kind. 43.Any illegal act by civil servants, be it a crime or a tort, which causes material or moral damage may be the subject of a claim for compensation before the ordinary civil courts. 44.Proceedings against the administration may be brought before the administrative courts, whose proceedings are in writing. 45.Damage caused by terrorist violence may be compensated out of the Aid and Social Solidarity Fund. 46.Articles13 to15 of the Constitution provide for fundamental limitations on constitutional safeguards. 47.Provisional Article15 of the Constitution provides that there can be no allegation of unconstitutionality in respect of measures taken under laws or decrees having the force of law and enacted between 12September 1980 and 25October 1983. That includes Law no.2935 on the State of Emergency of 25October 1983, under which decrees have been issued which are immune from judicial challenge. 48.Extensive powers have been granted to the Regional Governor of the State of Emergency by such decrees, especially Decree no.285, as amended by Decrees nos.424 and 425, and Decree no.430. 49.Decree no.285 modifies the application of Law no.3713, the Anti-Terror Law (1981), in those areas which are subject to the state of emergency, with the effect that the decision to prosecute members of the security forces is removed from the public prosecutor and conferred on local administrative councils. According to the Commission, these councils are made up of civil servants and have been criticised for their lack of legal knowledge, as well as for being easily influenced by the Regional Governor or Provincial Governors who also head the security forces. 50.Article8 of Decree no.430 of 16December 1990 provides as follows: “No criminal, financial or legal responsibility may be claimed against the State of Emergency Regional Governor or a Provincial Governor within a state of emergency region in respect of their decisions or acts connected with the exercise of the powers entrusted to them by this decree, and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to this end. This is without prejudice to the rights of individuals to claim indemnity from the State for damage suffered by them without justification.” 51.According to the submissions of the applicants, this Articlegrants impunity to the Governors and reinforces the powers of the Regional Governor to order the permanent or temporary evacuation of villages, to impose residence restrictions and to enforce the transfer of people to other areas. Damage caused in the context of the fight against terrorism would be “with justification” and therefore immune from suit.",1997,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

76,001-101568,Grand Chamber,"10.The applicant was born in 1979. He is currently serving his sentence in the Novosibirsk Region. 11.On 30 April 2001 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having murdered his father and uncle. The applicant made a written request to be provided with a legal-aid lawyer. On the same day an expert examination of fingerprints and a forensic examination were ordered and on 3 May 2001 the applicant was remanded in custody. 12.On 4 May 2001 legal-aid counsel, Ms P., was appointed to assist the applicant, and he was charged with aggravated murder on 10 May 2001. 13.From May to September 2001 a number of expert examinations were carried out. Subsequently the applicant received copies of orders for such examinations. He signed each of them confirming their receipt and indicating that he had no comments or requests. 14.On 30 September 2001 the detention order was lifted and replaced with an undertaking not to leave his place of residence. 15.In October 2001 the applicant's former cellmate in the detention facility, Mr Zh., testified that the applicant had told him in detail how he had murdered his father and another man. 16.On an unknown date the applicant's friend, Mr R., gave a witness statement alleging that the applicant had asked him to murder his father and that when R. refused the applicant seemingly intended to do it himself. 17.On 5 November 2001 the applicant was again remanded in custody. 18.On 20 December 2001 the examined the criminal charges against the applicant. The applicant pleaded not guilty. The court examined seventeen witnesses including Zh. and R., and found the applicant guilty of the murder of two persons, sentencing him to eighteen years' imprisonment. In its judgment the court referred to witness statements, forensic reports and extensive material evidence. 19.The applicant and his lawyer appealed, alleging that Zh. and R. had given their statements under pressure from the police and claiming that the investigation had been vitiated by numerous violations of the applicant's defence rights. They also complained that they had received the expert examination orders belatedly. 20.On 12 May and 29 July 2002 the applicant requested to be assigned another lawyer to represent him in the appeal proceedings because Ms P. was unable to attend the hearing, as she was already engaged in another trial. 21.On an unknown date the applicant was informed that his participation in the appeal hearing would be ensured by video link. On 26and 30 July 2002 he requested leave to attend the appeal proceedings in person because he did not consider that the video link would provide him with an adequate opportunity to participate in the hearing. 22.On 16 October 2002 the Supreme Court of the ordered the Moscow IZ-77/3 detention centre to ensure the applicant's participation in the appeal hearing, which was to take place on 31 October 2002, by video link. 23.On 31 October 2002 the Supreme Court of the examined the applicant's appeal. The applicant participated in the proceedings by video link. No defence counsel attended the hearing. The court dismissed the applicant's appeal, having found no proof that the testimony of Zh. and R. was false. As regards the alleged breach of his defence rights, the court found this to be unsubstantiated. 23.On 31 October 2002 the Supreme Court of the examined the applicant's appeal. The applicant participated in the proceedings by video link. No defence counsel attended the hearing. The court dismissed the applicant's appeal, having found no proof that the testimony of Zh. and R. was false. As regards the alleged breach of his defence rights, the court found this to be unsubstantiated. 24.In the following months the applicant filed several supervisory review complaints. In letters of 24 April and 19 November 2003 the Novosibirsk Prosecutor's Office and the General Prosecutor's Office informed the applicant that they refused to entertain his complaints. The Novosibirsk Prosecutor's Office noted, in particular, that the applicant's right to take part in the appeal proceedings had been fully respected. On 2July 2003 Judge R. of the Supreme Court refused to open supervisory review proceedings on the applicant's complaint. That decision was confirmed by the President of the Supreme Court on 5 December 2003. On 4 February 2004 another supervisory-review complaint by the applicant was returned without examination, with reference to the earlier decisions on that matter. 25.On 26 March 2007 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Russian Government. On 4 July 2007 the Presidium of the Supreme Court granted an application for supervisory review by the Deputy Prosecutor General and quashed the Supreme Court's appeal decision of 31October 2002. The Presidium found that the applicant's right to legal assistance had been violated in the appeal hearing and remitted the case for a fresh examination before the appellate court. 26.The applicant requested to take part in the appeal hearing in person. On 10 August 2007 the Supreme Court, sitting as a bench of three judges, granted him leave to attend in person and ordered the applicant's temporary transfer from the prison in the Novosibirsk Region to a detention facility in Novosibirsk (over 3,000 km from Moscow), apparently to allow him to use the video link. 27.On 20 August 2007 the applicant made a new statement of appeal. He requested the Supreme Court to examine his appeal on the basis of this new statement alone and also requested leave to attend the appeal hearing in person rather than by video link. 28.On 29 November 2007 the Supreme Court, sitting in , examined the case. First, it considered the applicant's requests of 20 August 2007. In a separate decision on procedure it found that there were no grounds to accept the applicant's new statement of appeal and decided to examine the case on the basis of the statement by the applicant's former counsel, Ms P., from 2002. It also rejected the applicant's request to attend in person, finding that the video link would be sufficient to ensure that the applicant could follow the proceedings and make objections or other submissions, and that this form of participation would be no less effective than if he was personally present in the courtroom. The Supreme Court then introduced the applicant to Ms A., his new legal-aid counsel who was present in the Supreme Court's courtroom and then allowed them fifteen minutes of confidential communication by video link before the start of the hearing. All persons, both in the courtroom and in the detention facility, left the rooms. 29.The applicant rejected the assistance of Ms A. on the grounds that he needed to meet his counsel in person. The Supreme Court, having noted that the applicant did not rely on any divergence with Ms A. in his defence, did not request her replacement by another legal-aid lawyer, did not accept the Supreme Court's proposal to retain private counsel of his choosing and, taking into account the quashing of the previous appeal decision on the grounds of a lack of legal assistance, rejected the applicant's objection to the counsel's assistance. Accordingly, Ms A. represented the applicant in the appeal hearing. 30.On the same day the Supreme Court examined the merits of the case. It upheld the judgment of the Novosibirsk Regional Court of 20 December 2001, making one correction to the text and excluding one piece of evidence. The substantive findings and the applicant's sentence remained unchanged. 31.Article 51 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation (in force from 1 July 2002) provides for mandatory legal representation if the accused faces serious charges carrying a term of imprisonment exceeding fifteen years, life imprisonment or the death penalty. Unless counsel is retained by the accused, it is the responsibility of the investigator, prosecutor or the court to appoint legal-aid counsel. Article52 of the Code provides that the accused can waive his right to legal assistance, but such waiver must be established in the written form. The waiver can be revoked at any moment. 32.Article 373 of the Code provides that the appellate court (суд кассационной инстанции) examines appeals (кассационные жалобы) with a view to verifying the lawfulness, validity and fairness of judgments. Under Article 377 §§ 4 and 5 of the Code, it may directly examine evidence, including additional material submitted by parties. 33.Article 402 of the Code (“Appeal against judgments, decisions and rulings which have come into force”) stipulates as follows: “1.Defendants who have been convicted or acquitted, ... and the public prosecutor shall be entitled to request review of court judgments ... which have come into force in accordance with the procedure set out in the present Chapter.>The public prosecutor's request shall be termed a supervisory-review application (представление). Other parties' requests shall be termed supervisory-review complaints (жалоба).” 34.Article 406 of the Code (“Examination of supervisory-review complaints or applications”) stipulates as follows: “1.A supervisory-review complaint or application shall be examined by a supervisory-review court within 30 days of being lodged.>The judge who examines the supervisory-review complaint or application may, where necessary, obtain ... any criminal case file ...>After examining the supervisory-review complaint or application, the judge shall decide as follows: either (i)to dismiss the supervisory-review complaint or application; or, (ii)to institute supervisory-review proceedings and to pass the supervisory-review complaint or application for consideration to the supervisory-review court ...>The President of the [competent] court may decline to accept the judge's decision to dismiss the supervisory-review complaint or application. In this case he shall set aside this decision and give a decision according to paragraph 3 (ii) [above].” 35.Article 412 of the Code (“Lodging of new supervisory-review complaints or applications”) stipulates as follows: “1.It is forbidden to lodge new supervisory-review complaints or applications with a court which has already dismissed such complaints or applications.>Where an earlier judgment, decision or ruling has been quashed on appeal or under the supervisory-review procedure, it is possible to lodge a supervisory-review complaint or application against it in accordance with the rules of the present Chapter, irrespective of the reasons why the original judgment, decision or ruling was quashed.” Article 413 of the Code, setting out the procedure for re-opening of criminal cases, reads, in so far as relevant, as follows: “1.Court judgments and decisions which became final should be quashed and proceedings in a criminal case should be re-opened due to new or newly discovered circumstances. ...>New circumstances are: ... (2)a violation of a provision of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms committed by a court of the during examination of a criminal case and established by the European Court of Human Rights, pertaining to: (a)application of a federal law which runs contrary to provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; (b)other violations of provisions of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; ....” B.Case-law of the and of the Supreme Court of Russia 36.Examining the compatibility of Article 51 of the Code of Criminal Procedure with the Constitution, the ruled as follows (decision no. 497-O of 18 December 2003): “Article 51 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which describes the circumstances in which the participation of defence counsel is mandatory, does not contain any indication that its requirements are not applicable in appeal proceedings or that the convict's right to legal assistance in such proceedings may be restricted.” “Article 51 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which describes the circumstances in which the participation of defence counsel is mandatory, does not contain any indication that its requirements are not applicable in appeal proceedings or that the convict's right to legal assistance in such proceedings may be restricted.” 37.That position was subsequently confirmed and developed in seven decisions delivered by the on 8 February 2007. It found that free legal assistance for the purpose of appellate proceedings should be provided in the same conditions as for earlier stages in the proceedings and that it was mandatory in the situations listed in Article 51. It further underlined the obligation of courts to secure participation of defence counsel in appeal proceedings. 37.That position was subsequently confirmed and developed in seven decisions delivered by the on 8 February 2007. It found that free legal assistance for the purpose of appellate proceedings should be provided in the same conditions as for earlier stages in the proceedings and that it was mandatory in the situations listed in Article 51. It further underlined the obligation of courts to secure participation of defence counsel in appeal proceedings. 38.On 18 December 2003 the Constitutional Court of Russia dismissed a constitutional complaint by Mr R. as inadmissible. In its ruling (определение) the held inter alia that Article 51 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which defined situations where participation of a defence lawyer in the criminal proceedings was mandatory, also applied to the proceedings before the court of appeal. 39.In a number of cases (decisions of 13 October 2004 and 26 January, 9 February, 6 April, 15 June and 21 December 2005, 24 May and 18October 2006, 17 January 2007, 3 September and 15 October 2008) the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation quashed judgments of appeal courts and remitted cases for fresh consideration on the ground that the courts had failed to secure the presence of defence counsel in the appeal proceedings, although it was obligatory for the accused to be legally represented. That approach was also confirmed by the Presidium of the Supreme Court in its report concerning cases adopted in the third quarter of 2005 (Decree of 23 November 2005) and by the Decree of the Plenary of the Supreme Court of 23 December 2008, as amended on 30 June 2009. In the later document the Supreme Court emphasised that the accused could waive his right to a lawyer only in writing, and that the court was not bound by that waiver.",2010,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

62,001-73196,Grand Chamber,"“Under section 11 of the Law of 31 December 1987 reforming administrative proceedings, ‘an appeal on points of law to the Conseil d’Etat is first subjected to an admissibility procedure. Leave to appeal is refused by judicial decision if the appeal is inadmissible or not based on a genuine ground of appeal’. In applying for the judgment of 20 October 1998 [of] the Court of Audit ... to be set aside, Mr Martinie submitted that the judgment had been given in breach of the provisions of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention ..., since he had neither been summoned to appear nor invited to submit his observations; he had not been aware of the date of the hearing fixed by the Court of Audit; and the reporting judge and counter-reporting judge had taken part in the deliberations of the Court of Audit. In his submission, the Court had misdirected itself in law in considering that only an executory resolution of the school’s board of governors could have constituted justification for the payment; the accountant could not be held liable for the expenditure paid by the [CNEA] prior to 21 February 1992, which was the date of his appointment as accountant of the ‘direct accounting department’ that had borne the irregular expenditure; and, lastly, the Court of Audit had further misdirected itself in law by ordering repayment of the sum in question to the Lycée René-Cassin. None of these grounds justifies granting leave to appeal.” Article 12 “Accountants are required: ... B – in connection with expenditure, to check that the authorising officer or his delegate has the requisite capacity to act; that the funds are available; that the expenditure is accurately attributed to the appropriate heads, in accordance with its nature or purpose; that the claims are valid according to the terms set forth in Article 13 below; that payment has been effected in accordance with the statutory conditions for discharging the debtor. ...” Article 13 “With regard to the validity of the claims, accountants shall check that the service has actually been rendered and the amounts accurately calculated; that the statutory controls have been effected and the supporting documents produced. In addition, in so far as provided by the rules specific to each public institution, public accountants shall check that the financial controllers’ stamp of approval has been affixed to the liabilities and payment authorisations issued by the main authorising officers. Public accountants shall also check that the rules on limitation periods have been applied.” Public accountants who have been found liable or whose liability is in issue may, in cases of force majeure, be fully or partly discharged from liability; they may also obtain remission, on a non-contentious application, in respect of amounts for which they remain liable (section 60-IX of Law no. 63-156). The Government indicated that decisions on this type of application were made by the Minister of Finance, who “differentiated between what was a personal failing and what was a case of force majeure or circumstances capable of mitigating the accountant’s liability (such as inadequacy of the resources attached to the post)”.>Judicial scrutiny of accounts rendered by public accountants of local authorities and their public institutions 16.The appeal is either lodged with the registry of the regional audit office, and an acknowledgment of receipt obtained, or sent to the registry by registered post with recorded delivery. Fifteen days after registration of the appeal, the Government Commissioner communicates it to the other persons having a right of appeal and simultaneously sends a copy to Principal State Counsel at the Court of Audit (Article R. 243-8 of the Financial Judicature Code). The parties have one month from the transmission of the appeal in which to consult all the documents annexed to the appeal at the registry of the regional audit office and to lodge defence pleadings. During the same period State Counsel (the Government Commissioner) can submit observations. A copy of the pleadings and observations is served by State Counsel on the appellant and the other parties, who may, within one month of transmission, lodge a reply, which is itself sent to the parties, and to which a rejoinder can be lodged within fifteen days. State Counsel may submit observations on the defence pleadings and replies lodged by the various parties. These observations are served on the interested parties (Article R. 243-9 of the Financial Judicature Code). If further documents are added to the file, the appellant and the other parties have fifteen days in which to inspect them and, if they wish, file their observations with the registry of the regional audit office (Article R. 243-10 of the Financial Judicature Code). Once these time-limits have expired, State Counsel (the Government Commissioner) sends the appeal, a copy of the judgment, the documents produced by the appellant and the pleadings and documents produced by the other parties and the observations by State Counsel to Principal State Counsel at the Court of Audit (Article R. 243-11 of the Financial Judicature Code; since Decree no. 2002-1201 of 27 September 2002 came into force, the Government Commissioner notifies the appellant and the other parties that these documents have been sent to Principal State Counsel). 17.Principal State Counsel at the Court of Audit sends the appeal file to the Court of Audit (Article R. 112-8, paragraph 4, of the Financial Judicature Code) in a document which – the Government specify – “is customarily referred to as an ‘application’ but does not imply any personal initiative on the part of Principal State Counsel (Conseil d’Etat, 6 January 1995, Gouazé; 27 October 2000, Mme Desvignes)”. Reports relating, inter alia, to surcharges and appeals against judgments delivered by regional audit offices have to be sent to Principal State Counsel, who makes written submissions on them (Article R. 112-8, paragraph 5, of the Financial Judicature Code); in doing so, he gives an opinion that the bench is free to follow or reject. He may attend the sessions of the divisions or sections and submit oral observations, but does not take part in the deliberations (Decree no. 2002-1201 of 27 September 2002, codified in Article R. 112-8 in fine of the Financial Judicature Code; the Government indicated that, prior to the entry into force of that decree, this principle had already been hallowed by usage). In the light of the appeal file, the report and the submissions of Principal State Counsel, the counter-reporting judge – who, according to the Government, sits on the bench hearing the appeal – expresses orally, during the hearing, his opinion on the reporting judge’s proposals (Article R. 141-8 of the Financial Judicature Code). 18.Where the Court of Audit hears an appeal against a judgment of a regional audit office levying a surcharge against a public accountant, the hearings before it are not public and the parties are not informed in advance of the date of the appeal hearings (the converse situation applies where the Court of Audit gives a final ruling in a case concerning de facto management of public funds or the imposition of a fine – Articles R. 141-9 to R. 141-13 of the Financial Judicature Code, added to the Code by Decree no.2002-1201 of 27 September 2002; Articles L. 131-2 and L. 131-13 of the Financial Judicature Code specify, moreover, that in the former case – de facto management – the judgments of the Court of Audit “are deliberated upon after hearing submissions, at their request, from the appellants and other interested parties” and that, in the latter case – imposition of a fine – the same applies in favour of the “persons concerned”). The procedure to be followed at the hearing is set out in Article R. 141-8 of the Financial Judicature Code (as amended by Decree no. 2002-1201): “The reporting judge shall present his report to the bench hearing the appeal. The counter-reporting judge shall express his view on each of the proposals submitted. If the report has been sent to Principal State Counsel, the latter’s submissions shall be read out. Where Principal State Counsel, or one of the advocates-general, is present at the hearing, he shall make his submissions and take part in the proceedings. The bench shall then deliberate. It shall give a decision on each proposal. If a vote has to be taken, the president shall ascertain, in turn, the opinion of the reporting judge, of each of the extraordinary senior members for cases they are empowered to hear under Article L. 112-5, then of each of the senior members in reverse order of seniority at that grade. The president states his opinion last. In the event of an equal number of votes, he shall have the casting vote. However, in cases concerning de facto management or the imposition of a fine, the bench shall deliberate without the reporting judge being present. ...”>Case-law of the Conseil d’Etat on the applicability of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to proceedings before the Court of Audit 21.Decree no. 2005-1586 of 19 December 2005 is worded as follows: “... Chapter II – Provisions relating to the appointment of Government Commissioners Article 2 The first paragraph of Article R. 122-5 of the Code shall be replaced by the following paragraph: Article 3 The first paragraph of Article R. 222-9 of the Code shall be replaced by the following paragraph: Article 4 The first paragraph of Article R. 222-23 of the Code shall be replaced by the following paragraph: Chapter III – Provisions relating to deliberations Article 5 Title III of Book VII of the Code shall now be entitled ‘Conduct of the hearing and deliberations’. Article 6 The following five Articles shall be inserted after Article R. 731-4 of the Code: Article 7 The words ‘After deliberations without the parties being present, and’ shall be deleted from Article R. 741-1 of the Code. Article 8 The following new paragraph shall be inserted after the third paragraph of ArticleR.741-2 of the Code: ...”",2006,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

177,001-58762,Grand Chamber,"7.In July 1972 the applicant was engaged as an official employed under an individual contract (agent contractuel) by the Economic Development Department of the Ministry for Economic Affairs. Under a contract of 29September 1977 he was sent to Athens to work as a technical adviser. Following an amendment of 30 August 1984 to the contract of 29September 1977, he was posted to New York with effect from 25 June 1984 to head an autonomous section of the Economic Development Department. Under the authority of the chief commercial adviser of the New York office, who was himself responsible to the chief commercial adviser at the French embassy in Washington, to whom the agricultural attaché was also answerable, he was placed in charge of the wines, beers and spirits sector, where he had dealings with exporters and importers and, in particular, the SOPEXA company (Société pour l'expansion des ventes des produits alimentaires et agricoles).>In accordance with Decree no. 69-697 of 18 June 1969 on the general terms and conditions of service of persons working overseas for the State under individual contracts, the applicant was employed on a series of thirty-month contracts which were to be automatically renewed unless expressly terminated. The State could terminate any contract on three months' notice for, inter alia, inadequate performance.>In a letter dated 10 December 1985, which was served on the applicant on 27 December 1985, the Minister for Economic Affairs informed the applicant that, owing to his inadequate performance, he did not intend to renew his contract when it expired on 13 April 1986. In a letter dated 9 January 1986, served on the applicant on 21 January 1986, the Minister informed him of his final decision not to renew the contract, on the ground that, among other matters, the applicant had shown a marked lack of initiative towards importers. 10.By letters of 28 February, 3 March and 13 June 1986, the applicant lodged three applications for judicial review of this decision with the Paris Administrative Court. The first sought to have the Minister's first letter of 10December 1985, which was in the nature of a preliminary to a final decision, set aside. The second was aimed at having the final decision to dismiss the applicant, contained in the letter of 9 January 1986, quashed. The third challenged the lawfulness of the appointment of the applicant's replacement. 11.In a judgment of 6 January 1989 the Paris Administrative Court, having joined all three applications, dismissed them. 12.On 24 October 1989 the applicant gave notice of an appeal to the Conseil d'Etat on points of law. He lodged a statement of the grounds of appeal on 23 February 1990. In a judgment of 10 May 1995, which was served on the applicant on 26 October 1995, the Conseil d'Etat dismissed the appeal, holding, inter alia, that it had been lawful for the Minister to dismiss the applicant on the ground of inadequate performance. 13.According to Article 1 of Decree no. 50-446 of 19 April 1950 laying down regulations governing the terms and conditions of service specific to economic development personnel, “the civil servants of the economic development offices overseas constitute a body of staff responsible to the Minister for Economic Affairs. In the performance of their duties they shall be attached to either a diplomatic delegation or a consulate ...” Article 3 of the decree provides that they are to act as delegates of the Minister for Economic Affairs in respect of all matters relating to France's foreign trade. In particular, they are responsible for studying all problems having a bearing on the French economy, supplying information to the various French administrative authorities and assisting with the preparation, negotiation and execution of commercial treaties and agreements. They must also participate in various surveys or special projects and in all economic events organised or run by the various ministries or official groups, defend the country's general economic interests and on that account provide direct assistance, in overseas markets, to French businessmen, industrialists and agricultural producers. The Overseas Economic Development Department has an establishment of 128 staff. Commercial attachés second class are recruited from among graduates of the National College of Administration (ENA); commercial advisers of the various classes may in addition be recruited from the State civil service. All commercial advisers and attachés are posted abroad by order of the Minister for Economic Affairs, made after the agreement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been obtained. 14.In addition, by Law no. 50-340 of 27 March 1950, five posts of agricultural attaché have been created. Agricultural attachés are responsible to the head of the relevant economic development office. Their duties are described in Article 3 of Decree no. 56-1242 of 3 December 1956: they study, from the technical point of view, problems affecting French agricultural development, particularly by seeking outlets in the local market for imports of French agricultural produce, and act as advisers during the preparation of negotiations on international commercial agreements and their application, assisting the head of office in his relations with the public administrative authorities dealing with foreign trade matters. 15.The general terms and conditions of service of persons of French nationality working overseas for the State or State public administrative bodies under individual contracts are laid down by Decree no. 69-697 of 18June 1969. The provisions of the decree are not applicable to technical assistance or cooperation staff placed at the disposal of foreign States. The different types of post are defined in orders made by the ministries concerned. They may be filled either by non-established employees or by established civil servants. 16.The relevant provisions of the decree are worded as follows: Article 6 “Persons to whom Article 1 applies shall sign a contract of service. The contract, which must refer to the provisions of this decree, shall specify its duration, the date on which it is to take effect, the staff member's category, grade and duties, the appropriate residence allowance group, the country of the posting and, where applicable, the family allowance group.” Article 8 “Where the staff member was recruited in the country of the posting, the contract must be for a period of at least three years. Where the staff member was recruited in France or in a foreign country other than the country of the posting, the contract must be for at least thirty months plus the length of his or her official home leave entitlement. ... A contract does not become final until expiration of the period of probation or training which the staff member may be required to complete immediately after signature of the contract in the country of recruitment. The contract may be terminated by either party without restriction or notice at any time during this traineeship period or on its expiry.” Article 10 “The contract shall be terminated: 1.when it expires, save that it will be deemed to have been tacitly renewed for a period equivalent to its original length unless terminated either by the State or by the member of staff at least three months before the date on which it is due to expire. Refusal to renew the contract or to sign a new contract shall be deemed a resignation. Such a refusal on the part of the State shall be deemed a dismissal, save where a new contract is signed within six months of the expiry of the previous one; 2.at any time if terminated by the State on three months' prior notice where the grounds for the termination are redundancy or inadequate performance; [or] in the case of dismissal on disciplinary grounds.” 17.Article 48(4) of the Treaty of 25 March 1957 instituting the European Economic Community (“the EEC Treaty”) provides for a derogation from the principle of freedom of movement for workers within the Community in respect of “employment in the public service”. The Court of Justice of the European Communities has developed a restrictive interpretation of this derogation. In its judgment of 17 December 1980 in the case of Commission v. Belgium (C-149/79, ECR 3881) it decided that the derogation concerned only posts which involved direct or indirect participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State or of other public authorities, and which thus presumed on the part of those occupying them the existence of a special relationship of allegiance to the State and a reciprocity of rights and duties which formed the foundation of the bond of nationality. 18.The European Commission, to which the EEC Treaty assigned responsibility for ensuring the correct application of Community rules, noted that a large number of posts likely to be caught by the derogation had in reality no bearing on the exercise of powers conferred by public law or protection of the general interests of the State. 19.In a communication of 18 March 1988 it set itself the task of listing separately those activities which were covered by the derogation and those which were not. It thus established two distinct categories of activities according to whether or not they involved “direct or indirect participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State”. 20.These categories were defined as follows: “Exclusion of specific activities in the national public service [from freedom of movement for workers] On the basis of current Court of Justice rulings, and bearing in mind the present conditions for establishing the single market, the Commission considers that the derogation in Article 48(4) covers specific functions of the State and similar bodies such as the armed forces, the police and other forces for the maintenance of order, the judiciary, the tax authorities and the diplomatic corps. This derogation is also seen as covering posts in State Ministries, regional government authorities, local authorities and other similar bodies, central banks and other public bodies, where the duties of the post involve the exercise of State authority, such as the preparation of legal acts, the implementation of such acts, monitoring of their application and supervision of subordinate bodies ... Activities concerned by action in the public service sector The Commission considers that the functions involved in certain forms of public employment are for the most part sufficiently remote from the specific activities of the public service as defined by the Court of Justice that they would only in very rare cases be covered by the exception in Article 48(4) of the Treaty. The Commission proposes therefore to implement its action in the following areas by order of priority: –bodies responsible for administering commercial services (e.g. public transport, electricity and gas supply, airline and shipping companies, posts and telecommunications, radio and television companies), –public health care services, –teaching in State educational establishments, –research for non-military purposes in public establishments. Each of these activities also exists in the private sector, to which Article 48(4) does not apply, or may be exercised in the public sector without the imposition of nationality requirements ...”",2000,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

71,001-58299,Grand Chamber,"10.Mr Karlheinz Beer is a German national, born in 1952 and resident in Darmstadt. MrPhilipRegan is a British national, born in 1960 and resident in London in the United Kingdom. 11.In 1982 the first applicant, a civil engineer by profession and employed by the French company S., was placed at the disposal of the European Space Agency to perform services at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt. The first applicant’s contract was later taken over by the French company T. The second applicant, a systems programmer and employed by the Italian company T., was placed at the disposal of the European Space Agency to perform services at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt in 1991. 12.The European Space Agency (“ESA”) with headquarters in Paris, formed out of the European Space Research Organisation (“ESRO”) and the European Organisation for the Development and Construction of Space Vehicle Launchers (“ELDO”), was established under the Convention for the Establishment of a European Space Agency (“ESA Convention”) of 30 May 1975 (United Nations Treaty Series 1983, vol. 1297, I – no. 21524). ESA runs the European Space Operations Centre (“ESOC”) as an independent operation in Darmstadt (Agreement concerning the European Space Operations Centre of 1967 – Official Gazette (Bundesgesetzblatt) II no. 3, 18.1.1969). 13.In October and November 1993 the applicants instituted proceedings before the Darmstadt Labour Court (Arbeitsgericht) against ESA, arguing that, pursuant to the German Provision of Labour (Temporary Staff) Act (Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz), they had acquired the status of employees of ESA. In his submissions, the second applicant indicated that, by letter of 27September 1993, his employer T. had dismissed him. 14.In the respective labour court proceedings, ESA relied on its immunity from jurisdiction under ArticleXV § 2 of the ESA Convention and its Annex 15.On 21 March 1995 the Darmstadt Labour Court, following hearings, declared the applicants’ respective actions inadmissible. In both decisions, the Labour Court considered that ESA had validly relied on its immunity from jurisdiction. The Labour Court, referring to section20(2) of the Courts Act (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz), according to which immunity from jurisdiction could be provided for, inter alia, in international agreements, considered that ESA enjoyed such immunity under Article XV § 2 of the ESA Convention and its Annex In its reasoning, the Labour Court considered in particular that ESA had been established in 1975 as a new and independent international organisation. It therefore rejected the applicants’ argument that ESA was bound by Article6 § 2 of the Agreement concerning ESOC, which had subjected the former ESRO to German jurisdiction in cases of disputes with its employees which were outside the competence of its Appeals Board. The Labour Court further recalled that the Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht), in a decision of 10 November 1993 in a similar case (file no. 7 AZR 600/92; see the Waite and Kennedy v. Germany judgment of 18 February 1999, to be published in the Court’s official reports, §§ 21-25), had found that the rules in question did not conflict with fundamental principles of German constitutional law. 16.In view of the decisions taken in the case of Mr Waite and MrKennedy, the applicants did not pursue the matter. 17.In the proceedings instituted by the second applicant against his dismissal by the company T. (see paragraph 13 above), a settlement had been reached in the Darmstadt Labour Court on 6 September 1994. According to this settlement, the second applicant’s employment with the company T. had terminated on 31December 1993, and the company T. undertook to pay to the second applicant the sum of 22,000 marks (DEM) for loss of job. 18.Under the terms of an agreement concluded on 20 June 1995 with the first applicant, terminating his contract of employment on 30 June 1995, the company T. undertook to pay to the first applicant the sum of DEM14,000 for lawyer’s fees incurred in labour court proceedings concerning his dismissal and DEM 305,000 for the loss of his job. 19.Section 1(1)(1) of the Provision of Labour (Temporary Staff) Act (Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz) provides that an employer who, on a commercial basis (gewerbsmäßig), intends to hire out his employees to third persons - hiring employers (Entleiher) - must obtain official permission. Section 1(9)(1) provides that contracts between the hirer-out (Verleiher) and the hiring employer and between the hirer-out and the employee hired out (Leiharbeitnehmer) are void if no official permission has been obtained as required by section1(1)(1). If the contract between a hirer-out and an employee hired out is void under section 1(9)(1), a contract between the hiring employer and the employee hired out is deemed to have been concluded (gilt als zustande gekommen) as from the envisaged start of employment (section1(10)(1)(1)). Section 1(10)(2) further provides for a claim in damages against the hirer-out in respect of any loss suffered as a consequence of having relied on the validity of the contract, except where the employee hired out was aware of the factor rendering the contract void. 20.Sections 18 to 20 of the German Courts Act (Gerichtsverfassungs-gesetz) regulate immunity from jurisdiction (Exterritorialität) in German court proceedings. Sections18 and19 concern the members of diplomatic and consular missions, and section 20(1) other representatives of States staying in Germany upon the invitation of the German Government. Section20(2) provides that other persons shall have immunity from jurisdiction according to the rules of general international law, or pursuant to international agreements or other legal rules. 21.The ESA Convention came into force on 30 October 1980, when ten States, members of ESRO or ELDO, had signed it and had deposited their instruments of ratification or acceptance. 22.The purpose of ESA is to provide for and to promote, for exclusively peaceful purposes, cooperation among European States in space research and technology and their space applications, with a view to their being used for scientific purposes and for operational space applications systems (Article II of the ESA Convention). For the execution of the programmes entrusted to it, the Agency shall maintain the internal capability required for the preparation and supervision of its tasks and, to this end, shall establish and operate such establishments and facilities as are required for its activities (Article VI § 1 (a)). 23.Article XV regulates the legal status, privileges and immunities of the Agency. According to paragraph 1, the Agency shall have legal personality. Paragraph 2 provides that the Agency, its staff members and experts, and the representatives of its member States, shall enjoy the legal capacity, privileges and immunities provided for in Annex Agreements concerning the headquarters of the Agency and the establishments set up in accordance with Article VI shall be concluded between the Agency and the member States on whose territory the headquarters and the establishments are situated (Article VI § 3). 24.Article XVII concerns the arbitration procedure in case of disputes between two or more member States, or between any of them and ESA, concerning the interpretation or application of the ESA Convention or its annexes, and disputes arising out of damage caused by ESA, or involving any other responsibility of ESA (Article XXVI of Annex I), which are not settled by or through the Council. 25.Article XIX provides that on the date of entry into force of the ESA Convention the Agency shall take over all the rights and obligations of ESRO. 26.Annex I relates to the privileges and immunities of the Agency. 27.According to Article I of Annex I, the Agency shall have legal personality, in particular the capacity to contract, to acquire and to dispose of movable and immovable property, and to be a party to legal proceedings. 27.According to Article I of Annex I, the Agency shall have legal personality, in particular the capacity to contract, to acquire and to dispose of movable and immovable property, and to be a party to legal proceedings. 27.According to Article I of Annex I, the Agency shall have legal personality, in particular the capacity to contract, to acquire and to dispose of movable and immovable property, and to be a party to legal proceedings. 28.Pursuant to Article IV § 1 (a) of Annex I, the Agency shall have immunity from jurisdiction and execution, except to the extent that it shall, by decision of the Council, have expressly waived such immunity in a particular case; the Council has the duty to waive this immunity in all cases where reliance upon it would impede the course of justice and it can be waived without prejudicing the interests of the Agency. 29.Article XXV of Annex I provides for arbitration with regard to written contracts other than those concluded in accordance with the Staff Regulations. Moreover, any member State may submit to the International Arbitration Tribunal referred to in Article XVII of the ESA Convention any dispute, inter alia, arising out of damage caused by the Agency, or involving any other non-contractual responsibility of the Agency. According to ArticleXXVII of AnnexI, the Agency shall make suitable provision for the satisfactory settlement of disputes arising between the Agency and the Director General, staff members or experts in respect of their conditions of service. 30.Chapter VIII of the ESA Staff Regulations (Regulations 33 to 41) concerns disputes within ESA. As regards the competence of its Appeals Board, Regulation 33 provides as follows: “33.1There shall be set up an Appeals Board, independent of the Agency, to hear disputes relating to any explicit or implicit decision taken by the Agency and arising between it and a staff member, a former staff member or persons entitled under him. 33.2The Appeals Board shall rescind any decision against which there has been an appeal if the decision is contrary to the Staff Regulations; Rules or Instructions or to the claimant’s terms of appointment or vested rights; and if the claimant’s personal interests are affected. 33.3The Appeals Board may also order the Agency to repair any damage suffered by the claimant as a result of the decision referred to in paragraph 2 above. 33.4Should the Agency – or the claimant – maintain that execution of a rescinding decision would raise major difficulties the Appeals Board may, if it considers the argument valid, award compensation to the claimant for the damage he has suffered. 33.5The Appeals Board shall also be competent in the case where a staff member wishes to sue another staff member and such action has been prevented by the Director General’s refusal to waive the immunity of the latter. 33.6The Appeals Board shall also be competent to settle disputes concerning its jurisdiction, as defined in these Regulations, or any question of procedure.” 31.The Agreement was concluded between the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and ESRO for the purpose of establishing a European Space Operations Centre, including the European Space Data Centre. Articles 1 to 4 of the Agreement concern the site for construction of the ESOC buildings and related matters. 32.Part III of the Agreement contains general provisions. Article 6 provides as follows: “1.Subject to the provisions of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the Organisation and of any complementary Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Organisation according to Article 30 of that Protocol, the activities of the Organisation in the Federal Republic of Germany shall be governed by German law. If the terms of employment of a staff member of the Organisation are not governed by the Organisation’s staff regulations, then they shall be subject to German laws and regulations.>Disputes between the Organisation and such staff members of the Organisation in the Federal Republic of Germany who are not within the competence of the Organisation’s Appeals Board, shall be subject to German jurisdiction.”",1999,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY
HOLDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION.

176,001-110164,Grand Chamber,"12.The applicant, who was born in 1972, was detained in Schrassig () Prison on the date the application was lodged. He is currently living in Peppange (). 13.On 15 December 1998 he was remanded in custody. 14.In a judgment of 22 October 2001, the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment, of which threeyears were suspended, for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, rape and false imprisonment accompanied by acts of torture, committed on 10December 1998. 15.The applicant provided the Court with copies of several court decisions, given between 14 June 2001 and 13 April 2005, concerning the issue of his visiting rights in respect of his three minor children following his divorce, made final on 19 October 2000. 16.While in prison, the applicant submitted requests for conditional release, transfer to Givenich semi-open prison and temporary leave of absence (“prison leave”). The requests for prison leave are the subject of the present case. 17.The applicant stated that he had submitted a request for prison leave to the Attorney-General in October 2003. 18.At the request of the counselling service’s psychologist, the applicant explained on 16 October 2003 that he was requesting prison leave for one day and had no objection to being escorted while on leave. He stated that the reason for the request was to complete certain administrative formalities, which he listed as follows: In his reply, the applicant stated further: “... Unfortunately, the civil damages are still far from being paid, as I have not even had enough funds to make a down-payment. At the moment I am still busy repaying my loans and other debts to the various authorities under the arrangements entered into with the legal departments in order to avoid an unending series of seizures of my property. ...” 19.On 29 October 2003 a psychologist issued a certificate stating that the applicant had begun a course of psychotherapy on 19 May 1999 which had been discontinued on 30 September 2002 for reasons beyond his control. She stressed that the applicant was anxious to understand what had driven him to commit the offences and to do everything possible to avoid reoffending. On 25 November 2003 a second psychologist, who certified that he had had regular meetings with the applicant since the beginning of 2003, agreed with the comments made in the certificate of 29 October 2003. 20.On 5 November 2003 the Attorney-General’s representative sent a memorandum to the prison governor stating, in particular, as follows: “... please inform the prisoner Thomas Boulois that by decision of the Prison Board [the] request for prison leave ... [is] refused in view of the risk of deportation (an application was made to the Ministry of Justice on 25 June 2003, but no decision has yet been taken). There is also a risk that the prisoner might abscond, given that he has failed to reflect on his crime. Before being allowed any privileges he must begin to pay the civil party.” 21.On 17 January 2004 the applicant reiterated his request, giving the same reasons and the same programme for the day’s prison leave. On 27January 2004 his lawyer confirmed the request and added, inter alia, the following: “... granting [the applicant] a day’s prison leave during which he could begin to put his affairs in order with a view to leading an independent life [outside] prison, [would] not only aid [the applicant’s] rehabilitation and reintegration into society, but [would] also enable him to start paying damages to the civil party as quickly as possible. ...” 22.On 17 March 2004 the Attorney-General’s representative sent a memorandum to the prison governor containing the following passage: “... please inform the prisoner Thomas Boulois that by decision of the Prison Board the decision of 5 November 2003 refusing his request for prison leave ... remains valid.” 23.On 25 May 2004 the applicant lodged an application with the (tribunal administratif) for judicial review of the decisions of the Prison Board of 5 November 2003 and 17 March 2004. 24.At a hearing held on 6 December 2004, the raised of its own motion the question whether it had jurisdiction to examine the application for judicial review. The government, who had not raised an objection alleging lack of jurisdiction, left the matter to the discretion of the court. The applicant pleaded that the latter had jurisdiction. 25.On 23 December 2004 the declined jurisdiction to examine the application for judicial review, for the following reasons: “... A distinction must be made between administrative measures relating to the treatment of prisoners in prison (such as a decision to place them in a more secure wing of the prison, and in particular imposing a strict confinement regime – see Administrative Court ruling no. 14568 of 10 July 2002), which are administrative decisions taken in the context of the running of the prison service, and decisions which may alter the nature or scope of a sentence imposed by the ordinary courts, which should be regarded as judicial rather than administrative decisions. In the instant case it should be noted that the granting or refusal of the privilege of prison leave constitutes a measure which alters the ‘scope’ of the sentence imposed on the applicant by the ordinary court. Hence, the two decisions in question are judicial in nature. Accordingly, having regard to their nature as identified above, the impugned decisions cannot be the subject of an application to the administrative courts ...” 26.On 14 April 2005 the (cour administrative) upheld that ruling in the following terms: “The [applicant] submitted that the court had erred in declining jurisdiction to examine his application for judicial review, arguing that: no other remedy existed in respect of such refusal, with the result that section 2(1) of the Law of 7 November 1996 on the organisation of the administrative courts should be applied; the impugned decisions did not alter the scope of the sentence; and the court had denied him justice in breach of Article [6 § 1] of the [Convention] by depriving him of a fair hearing. ... The [applicant]’s case concerns a request for prison leave, in other words, a decision which alters the terms of execution of the sentence imposed by the ordinary courts and which should therefore be classified as a judicial rather than an administrative decision. The expression ‘the scope of the sentence imposed’, used by the court, is not to be understood in the present case as the length of the sentence but as the manner of its execution in a broad sense. The was therefore correct in declining jurisdiction to examine the application. A finding by the administrative courts that they lack jurisdiction cannot be construed as a declaration of unwillingness on their part to rule on the issue; the allegation of a denial of justice should therefore be dismissed as unfounded. Article [6 § 1] of the [Convention] is not applicable in respect of a body which has no power to rule on the merits. ...” 27.On 11 August 2004 the applicant submitted a third request for prison leave, stating, inter alia, as follows: “... I have successfully attended several classes run by the CEP-L [Chamber of Employees] and would like to continue with a view to obtaining the corresponding diplomas. The diplomas concerned are in accounting and computer (PC) use. I completed the previous courses successfully, but if I am to achieve my aim it is now essential for me to be able to attend the classes of the autumn session at the CEP-L itself. ...” 28.In a decision of 21 September 2004, the request was refused on the ground that the applicant could attend courses in prison and that he had as yet made no substantial efforts towards paying compensation to the victim. The decision also referred to the reasoning of the decision of 5 November 2003. 29.On 14 October 2004 the applicant submitted a fourth request for prison leave – which he produced for the first time before the Grand Chamber – seeking permission to spend a day with his children over the StNicholas weekend. 30.In a decision of 14 December 2004, the request was refused on the ground that the applicant’s visiting rights in respect of his children had not yet been clearly established. 31.In a fifth request submitted on 24 February 2005, the applicant stated, among other things, that he could not understand why, in view of the need for him to reintegrate into society, he had been refused permission to attend the final classes required in order to obtain the diplomas in accounting and computing. He added that the reason he had requested prison leave was to renew his identity papers and driving licence and find a solution regarding the repayment of his debts to the various institutions and the civil party. 32.On 23 March 2005 his request was refused for failure to give reasons. 33.On 12 July 2005 a sixth request for prison leave was refused on the ground that there was a risk that the applicant would not return to prison. 34.On 4 May 2006 a seventh request for prison leave was refused on the grounds that the applicant had been making no efforts, especially with regard to paying compensation to the civil party, and had been refusing to abide by the conditions imposed on him. 35.Following the refusal of 4 May 2006, the applicant applied to the Attorney-General’s Department on five occasions between 10 May and 29October 2006. He requested assistance in putting in place a repayment plan appropriate to his circumstances and the demands of the civil party, and sought an explanation of the conditions imposed on him with a view to his reintegration into society, so that he could comply with them. On 6November 2006 the Attorney-General’s representative wrote to the applicant informing him that, as matters stood, he did not intend to reply to the various letters, which, in his view, did not call for any comment. 36.On 20 November 2006 the Attorney-General acknowledged receipt of a request from the applicant for an interview and said that he would meet him during one of his forthcoming visits to the prison. According to the applicant, the meeting never took place. 37.On 31 October 2008 the Prison Board granted the applicant one day’s prison leave, subject to the condition that he would be collected from the prison and brought back there by his new girlfriend, at whose home he was to spend the day. 38.Between 12 December 2008 and 19 June 2009 the applicant was granted five periods of prison leave of two consecutive days, to be spent with his girlfriend. 39.On 20 March 2009 the applicant was transferred to Givenich semiopen prison. The same day, in a separate decision, he was granted tendays’ prison leave in order to look for work and complete various administrative formalities; it was also decided to place him under the semicustodial regime once he had found work. 40.On 24 June 2009 the applicant signed a vocational rehabilitation contract as a cook. 41.On 25 September 2009 his request for conditional release was granted. 42.In three decisions (dated 25 September and 11 December 2009 and 26 February 2010), the requests made by the applicant for suspension of his sentence, due to end on 12 October 2010, were refused. 43.On 10 February 2010 the applicant started up a business as a sole trader. 44.On 15 July 2010 the applicant’s sentence was suspended. According to his submissions, he left Givenich Prison definitively on that date. 45.Section 1 of the Law of 26 July 1986 on certain means of executing custodial sentences (“the 1986 Law”) lists the various arrangements which execution of a custodial sentence may entail: “The execution of a custodial sentence may entail one of the following: serving of the sentence in instalments, semi-custodial regime, prison leave, suspension of sentence, early release.” 46.Section 6 of the 1986 Law defines prison leave as follows: “Prison leave shall consist of permission to leave prison either for part of a day or for periods of twenty-four hours. The time shall count towards the length of the sentence.” 47.Section 7 of the 1986 Law provides as follows with regard to the objectives of prison leave: “This privilege may be granted to prisoners who are domiciled or resident in the country, either for family reasons or to make preparations for their rehabilitation and reintegration into professional life, or on a trial basis with a view to their conditional release.” 48.Section 8 of the 1986 Law provides that this measure may be granted to first offenders once one-third of their sentence has been served. 49.Section 13 of the 1986 Law provides as follows: “In applying the arrangements provided for by this Law, consideration shall be given to the personality of the prisoner, his or her progress and the risk of a further offence.” According to the comments on this provision accompanying the relevant bill when it was submitted, the granting of measures relating to the means of executing a sentence “will never be automatic and will ultimately remain at the discretion of the postsentencing authority, which will decide freely on the basis of the information it has obtained concerning the prisoner”. 50.Under the terms of the Grand-Ducal Regulation of 19 January 1989 laying down, inter alia, detailed arrangements for the granting of prison leave, such leave may be granted at the request of the prisoner concerned or his or her representative (Article 4); the request must be made in writing, unless the prisoner is unable or does not know how to write. The interval between periods of leave must be at least one month, except in special circumstances (Article 5). Where a request for prison leave is refused, no new request may be made within two months, unless new evidence comes to light (Article 6). 51.Section 12 of the 1986 Law states as follows: “In the case of custodial sentences of over two years ... the measures provided for by this Law ... shall be taken by the Attorney-General or his or her representative in accordance with the majority decision of a board comprising, in addition to the Attorney-General or his or her representative, a judge and a public prosecutor. ... The board shall be convened by the Attorney-General or his or her representative and shall be chaired by the judge. With the exception of the Attorney-General or his or her representative, the full members and their substitutes shall be appointed by ministerial order for a renewable three-year term.” 52.In Recommendation No. 30, set out in his activity report on the year from 1 October 2007 to 30 September 2008, the Ombudsman expressed the view that the system for the execution of sentences in needed to be overhauled, and advocated the creation of the office of post-sentencing judge. The latter would give decisions, open to appeal, on applications for prison leave following adversarial proceedings. 53.In his activity report on the year from 1 October 2009 to 30September 2010, the Ombudsman took note of the fact that the Minister of Justice, in an article published in a Luxembourg daily newspaper, had spoken in favour of handing over to a judicial body some of the powers currently exercised by the Attorney-General’s representative with responsibility for the execution of sentences or by the Prison Board. On 22December 2011 the Minister of Justice presented the broad outlines of the planned prison reform, which included a bill approved by the government at a Cabinet meeting on 16 December 2011 reforming the system of execution of sentences by establishing, inter alia, a postsentencing court. The bill must now go through the different stages of the legislative procedure. 54.There are two prisons in , with a prison population of around 700. Most prisoners are held in Luxembourg Prison, which is a closed institution. There is also a semiopen prison (Givenich Prison) which mainly houses prisoners approaching the end of their sentences or serving shorter sentences.

In other words, the prisoners concerned had not yet served one-third of their sentence (in the case of a first offender) or half their sentence (in the case of a repeat offender), or the request was made less than two months after notification of the refusal of a previous request. 58.In 2009, 376 requests for prison leave were granted and 192 refused; for 2010, the figures were 409 and 191 respectively. 59.The Recommendation states, inter alia, as follows: “The Committee of Ministers, under the terms of Article 15.b of the Statute of the Council of Europe, ...

90,001-57993,Grand Chamber,"9. From the summer of 1987 until the end of the summer of 1990 the applicant owned the summer restaurant Ihrebaden at Ihreviken, Tingstäde, on the . The applicant further owned - and continues to own - the youth hostel Lummelunda at Nyhamn, Visby, also on Gotland. The restaurant’s employees numbered less than ten. They were engaged on a seasonal basis, but had the option of being re-employed the following year. The applicant’s ownership of the restaurant and youth hostel was direct and entailed his personal financial liability (enskild firma). 10. As the applicant was not a member of either of the two associations of restaurant employers, namely the Swedish Hotel and Restaurant Entrepreneurs’ Union (Hotell- och Restaurangar - betsgivareföreningen - ""HRAF"", which is affiliated to the Swedish Employers’ Confederation (Svenska Arbetsgivareföreningen - ""SAF"")) and the Employers’ Association of the Swedish Union of Restaurant Owners (Svenska Restauratörsförbundets Arbetsgivareförening - ""SRA""), he was not bound by any collective labour agreement (kollektivavtal) between the two associations and the Hotel and Restaurant Workers’ Union (Hotell- och Restauranganställdas Förbund - ""HRF""). Nor was he obliged to subscribe to the various labour-market insurance schemes (Arbetsmarknadsförsäkring) developed through agreements between SAF and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (Landsorganisationen). It was, however, open to the applicant to accede to a collective agreement by accepting a substitute agreement (hängavtal). He could also subscribe to insurance schemes with Labour-Market Insurances or any of the other ten or so insurance companies in the field. 11. In late June or early July 1987 he refused to sign a separate substitute agreement with HRF. He referred to his objections of principle regarding the system of collective bargaining. He also emphasised that his employees were paid more than they would have been under a collective agreement and that they themselves objected to his signing a substitute agreement on their behalf. The substitute agreement proposed to the applicant included these terms: ""Parties: [The applicant] and [HRF] Term of validity: From 1 July 1987 up to and including31 December 1988, thereafter for one year at a time, unlessnotice is given two months prior to the expiry of the[agreement] ... As from the [above] date, the most recent agreement between[the employers’ association] and [HRF] shall be applied between[the applicant and HRF]. Should [the employers’ association]and [HRF] subsequently reach a new agreement or agree to amendor supplement the [present] agreement, [the new agreement,amendments or supplements] shall automatically apply as fromthe day on which [it or they] [has or have] been [agreed upon]. ...> [The employer shall] [on his employees’ behalf] subscribeto and maintain [five different] insurance-policy schemes withLabour-Market Insurances, ... as well as other possibleinsurance-policy schemes which [the employers’ association andHRF] might later agree upon.> [The employer shall] issue employment certificates on aspecial form ... A copy shall be sent to [HRF].> [The employer shall] only employ [workers who are members]of or [have] requested membership of [HRF]. In the event ofre-employment the provisions of section 25 of the EmploymentProtection Act (lag (1982:80) om anställnings-skydd) shallapply.> [The employer shall] deduct on a monthly basis a part ofthe salary of employed members of [HRF] corresponding to theirmembership fees, and pay [the deducted part] to [HRF]. ..."" 12. On 16 July 1987, during further negotiations with the applicant, HRF proposed another substitute agreement, which he also rejected: ""Subject: The signing of a collective agreement regarding [therestaurant] Ihrebaden ... and the Lummelunda youth hostel.> Having regard to the forthcoming end of the [season of1987] the parties agree on the following procedure replacing the signing of a collective agreement. The enterprise agrees to comply, during this season ..., with the collective labour agreement (`the green nationalagreement’) between [HRAF] and [HRF], this including the obligation to subscribe to [certain] insurance schemes(avtalsförsäkringar) with Labour-Market Insurances.> The enterprise also agrees to [comply with] [the]collective labour agreement ... during the next season ...,either by way of membership of the employers’ union or bysigning a ... substitute agreement ..."" 13. Had the applicant accepted a substitute agreement, it would have applied not only to those of his employees who were unionised but also to those who were not. In the summer of 1986, one member of HRF was employed by the applicant. In 1987 he employed another member of that union and also two persons who were respectively members of the Commercial Employees’ Union (Handelsanställdas Förbund) and the Union of Municipal Workers (Kommunalarbetareförbundet). In 1989, one member of the latter union was employed by the applicant. 14. Following the applicant’s refusal to sign a substitute agreement, HRF, in July 1987, placed his restaurant under a ""blockade"" and declared a boycott against it. Sympathy industrial action was taken the same month by the Commercial Employees’ Union and the Swedish Food Workers’ Union (Svenska Livsmedelsarbetareförbundet). In the summer of 1988 sympathy action was also taken by the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union (Svenska transportarbetareförbundet) and the Union of Municipal Employees (Kommunaltjenestemannaförbundet). As a result deliveries to the restaurant were stopped. 15. One of the persons employed by the applicant at Ihre baden who was member of HRF had publicly expressed the opinion that the industrial action was unnecessary, as the salary and working conditions in the restaurant were not open to criticism. According to the Government, the union action had its background in a request for assistance in 1986 by an HRF member employed by the applicant. In the view of the union, the applicant paid his employees approximately 900 Swedish kronor (SEK) a month less than what they would have received under a collective agreement. He did not pay his staff holiday compensation as provided for in the 1977 Annual Leave Act (semesterlagen 1977:480), nor salary during lay-offs due to poor weather conditions as required by the 1982 Employment Protection Act and he did not sign a labour-market insurance until 1988. 16. In August 1988 the applicant, invoking the Convention, requested the Government to prohibit HRF from continuing the blockade and the other trade unions from continuing their sympathy action and to order the unions to pay compensation for damages. In the alternative, he requested that compensation be paid by the State. 17. By a decision of 12 January 1989 the Government (Ministry of Justice) dismissed the applicant’s request. The Government stated: ""The requests for a prohibition of the blockade and thesympathy action as well as compensation for damage from thetrade unions concern a legal dispute between private subjects.According to Chapter 11, Article 3, of the Instrument of Government [Regeringsformen which forms part of theConstitution], such disputes may not be determined by anypublic authority other than a court of law, except by virtueof law. There is no provision in the law which authorises theGovernment to examine such disputes. The Government will not,therefore, examine these requests on the merits. The claim for damages is dismissed."" 18. The applicant applied to the (Regeringsrätten) for review under the 1988 Act on Judicial Review of Certain Administrative Decisions (lag (1988:205) om rättsprövning av vissa förvaltningsbeslut - ""the 1988 Act""). On 29 June 1989 the dismissed the application on the ground that the Government’s decision did not concern an administrative matter involving the exercise of public power, which was a condition for review under section 1 of the Act. 19. On 15 September 1989 the Swedish Touring Club (Svenska turistföreningen - ""STF""), a non-profit-making association promoting tourism in Sweden, terminated the membership of the applicant’s youth hostel, referring to a lack of cooperation and the applicant’s negative attitude towards STF. As a result, the hostel was no longer mentioned in STF’s catalogue of youth hostels in . In 1989 about half of the youth hostels in were enrolled in STF. 20. The applicant brought proceedings in the District Court (tingsrätten) of . He contested what he considered to be his personal exclusion from STF, alleging that it had been caused by HRF threats that it would take industrial action against other youth hostels enrolled in STF if his hostel was not excluded. He also challenged STF’s termination of the membership of his youth hostel. STF accepted, inter alia, that although the termination of the membership contract concerning the applicant’s youth hostel had not been prompted by the conflict between the applicant and the trade unions, this conflict might have affected the timing of the decision. STF also referred to an opinion of the Competition Ombudsman (ombudsmannen för näringsfrihet) of 14 November 1989 to the effect that the termination of the contract in question would have only a very limited impact on his business. 21. By a judgment of 8 May 1991 the District Court rejected the applicant’s action on both points. It found, inter alia, that the applicant had not shown that he had been personally excluded from STF by virtue of the termination of STF’s contract concerning his youth hostel. It also found that he had not shown that the contract had been financially significant to his business. Reference was made to the Competition Ombudsman’s finding. 22. The applicant appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal (Svea hovrätt) which, on 6 March 1992, upheld the District Court’s judgment. The Court of Appeal found, inter alia, that STF’s termination of the contract concerning the youth hostel had entailed the expiry of the applicant’s personal membership of STF. This, however, had not been tantamount to his exclusion, given that he could have continued or renewed his membership. Moreover, although the contract had been of appreciable significance to the applicant’s business, STF’s termination of the contract could not be considered unreasonable. 23. At the beginning of 1991 the applicant sold his restaurant due to his difficulties in running his business which had allegedly been caused by the industrial action. The restaurant was bought by a person who signed a collective agreement with HRF. He continued, together with his family, to run the youth hostel in Lummelunda. Following the above, the union action was terminated. 24. On 9 November 1991 the applicant requested the Government to support his application to the Commission. On 12 December 1991 the Government decided not to take any action in respect of the request. 25. Chapter 2, Article 1, of the Instrument of Government provides: ""All citizens shall be guaranteed the following in theirrelations with the public authorities:> freedom of expression: the freedom to communicateinformation and to express ideas, opinions and emotions whether orally, in writing, in pictorial representations, or in anyother way; ...> freedom of association: the freedom to unite with othersfor public or private purposes; ..."" 26. According to Chapter 2, Article 2: ""All citizens shall be protected in their relations with the public authorities against all coercion designed to compel themto divulge an opinion in any political, religious, cultural orother similar connection. They shall furthermore be protectedin their relations with the public authorities against allcoercion designed to compel them to participate in any meetingfor the formation of opinion or in any demonstration or otherexpression of opinion or to belong to any politicalassociation, religious congregation or other association foropinions of the nature referred to in the first sentence."" 27. Chapter 2, Article 12 paras. 1 and 2, reads: ""The freedoms and rights referred to in Article 1 paras. 1 to5 ... may be restricted by law to the extent provided for inArticles 13-16 ... The restrictions referred to in the preceding subsection mayonly be imposed to achieve a purpose which is acceptable in ademocratic society. The restriction may never exceed what isnecessary having regard to the purpose which occasioned it, normay it be carried so far as to constitute a threat to the freeformation of opinion as one of the foundations of democracy.No restriction may be imposed solely on grounds of political,religious, cultural or other such opinions."" 28. Chapter 2, Article 14 para. 2 provides: ""Freedom of association may only be restricted in respect of organisations whose activities are of a military nature or the like or which involve the persecution of a population group of a particular race, skin colour or ethnic origin."" 29. Pursuant to Chapter 2, Article 17: ""Any trade union or employer or association of employers has a right to take industrial action unless otherwise provided by law or by agreement."" 30. Section 7 of the 1976 Act on Co-Determination at Work reads: ""Right of association means the right of employers andemployees to belong to an organisation of employers oremployees, to benefit from their membership as well as to workfor an organisation or for the founding of one."" 31. Section 8 provides: ""The right of association shall not be violated. A violation... will occur, if anyone from the employer’s side or the employee’s side takes any action to the detriment of anybodyon the other side by reason of that person having exercised hisright of association, or if anybody on either side takes anyaction against anybody on the other side with a view toinducing that person not to exercise his right of association.A violation will occur even if the action so taken is designedto fulfil an obligation towards another party. An employers’ or employees’ organisation shall not have to tolerate a violation of its right of association encroaching upon its activities. Where there is both a local and a central organisation, these provisions shall apply to the central organisation. If the right of association is violated by termination of anagreement or another legal measure or by a provision in acollective agreement or other contract, that measure orprovision shall be void."" 32. According to section 10: ""An employees’ organisation shall have the right to negotiatewith an employer regarding any matter relating to therelationship between the employer and any member of theorganisation who is or has been employed by that employer. Anemployer shall have a corresponding right to negotiate with anemployees’ organisation. A right of negotiation ... shall also be enjoyed by the employees’ organisation in relation to any organisation towhich an employer belongs, and by the employers’ organisationin relation to the employees’ organisation."" 33. Chapter 11, Article 3, of the Instrument of Government provides: ""Legal disputes between private subjects shall only be settledby a court of law, unless otherwise provided by law ..."" 34. In principle, it is possible for an employer against whom industrial action has been instituted to request a court injunction requiring that the action cease, and to claim damages. Such orders may be made by the relevant court if the industrial action is unlawful or in breach of an existing collective agreement. If the industrial action amounts to a criminal offence, a claim for compensation may be made under Chapter 2, section 4, of the 1972 Compensation Act (skadeståndslag 1972:207). 35. Pursuant to section 1 of the 1988 Act, a person who has been a party to administrative proceedings before the Government or another public authority may, in the absence of any other remedy, apply to the Supreme Administrative Court, as the first and only judicial instance, for review of any decisions in the case which involve the exercise of public authority vis-à-vis a private individual. The kind of administrative decision covered by the Act is further defined in Chapter 8, Articles 2 and 3, of the Instrument of Government, to which section 1 of the 1988 Act refers. According to these provisions the Act encompasses measures concerning, inter alia, personal and economic matters arising in relations between private persons and between such persons and the State. Section 2 of the Act specifies several types of decision which fall outside its scope, none of which are relevant in the instant case. In proceedings brought under the 1988 Act, the examines whether the contested decision ""conflicts with any legal rule"" (section 1 of the 1988 Act). If the court finds that the impugned decision is unlawful, it must quash it and, where necessary, refer the case back to the relevant administrative authority (section 5 of the 1988 Act).",1996,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

94,001-57999,Grand Chamber,"7. Mr Süßmann, a German national born in 1916, worked as a physicist in research institutes whose remuneration and pension system was the same as that of the civil service.> The applicant retired in 1980 and receives, in addition to the statutory pension, a supplementary pension (Versorgungsrente) paid to him by the Supplementary Pensions Fund of the Federation and the Länder (Versorgungsanstalt des Bundes und der Länder - VBL - ""the Fund""). The Fund administers a supplementary old-age pensions scheme, which enables German civil servants or persons with an equivalent status to receive a progressive supplementary pension.> As the total of the sums paid under the general old-age pensions scheme and the civil service supplementary scheme regularly exceeded the last net civil service salary, employers’ and employees’ representatives reached an agreement to amend the rules governing the Fund. These amendments, which came into force in March 1982 and March 1984, also concerned persons who were already affiliated to the supplementary scheme or in receipt of a pension thereunder. On 16 March 1988, giving judgment in a series of test cases, the Federal Court (Bundesgerichtshof) upheld the validity of these amendments. 10. On 30 April and 31 May 1985 the Fund calculated the sum payable to the applicant under the amended scheme with the result that his supplementary pension was reduced. 11. The applicant appealed to the Arbitration Tribunal of the Supplementary Pensions Fund (Schiedsgericht der VBL), challenging, inter alia, the legality of the amendments made to the rules governing the scheme. 12. Under an arbitration agreement of 3 and 18 September 1985 MrSüßmann and the Fund had recognised the jurisdiction of the Fund’s arbitration tribunals. 13. On 20 February 1987 the Arbitration Tribunal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. 14. On 11 May 1987 Mr Süßmann appealed from that decision to the Arbitration Appeals Tribunal of the Supplementary Pensions Fund (Oberschiedsgericht der VBL). 15. On 10 March 1989 the Appeals Tribunal likewise dismissed the applicant’s appeal finding that the reduction in his supplementary pension resulting from the amendment of the rules governing the Fund was not unlawful. 16. On 11 July 1988 the applicant lodged an appeal in the (Bundesverfassungsgericht) concerning the amendments to the Fund’s rules made in 1982 and 1984. Subsequently he also invoked other grounds. On 4 April 1989 he extended the scope of his appeal to cover the decision of the Arbitration Appeals Tribunal of 10 March 1989. 17. Sitting as a panel of three members, on 6 November 1991 the Second Section of the First Division (zweite Kammer des ersten Senats) of the declined to accept the case for adjudication on the ground that the prospects of its succeeding were insufficient. The noted that the appeal was inadmissible in so far as it raised for the first time issues of fact or of law that could have been pleaded in the ordinary courts. However, it found the remaining complaints admissible, in particular those relating to the unfair character of the proceedings in the Federal Court and the interference with the applicant’s right of property. As the Federal Court had ruled on the issues of fact and law at last instance in its judgments in the test cases of 16 March 1988, it was not necessary to file further appeals to exhaust the remedies in the ordinary courts. However, even in regard to the complaints declared admissible, the considered that the constitutional appeal lacked sufficient prospects of success. It gave the following reasons:> There had been no violation of the applicant’s right to be heard in a court (Recht auf Gewährung rechtlichen Gehörs). In particular there was nothing to suggest that the tribunals had not taken due account of evidence concerning the amendment of the Fund’s rules. The decisions were essentially based on two reports drawn up by expert commissions in September 1975 and November 1983. It had not been necessary to take additional evidence.> Even if it were accepted that pension rights came within the ambit of the constitutional right of property, there was nothing to indicate that there had been an infringement of that right. It was lawful to reduce pension rights by amending the rules which were of a private-law character. The Federal Court had held that the pensions under the scheme administered by the Fund were a matter of private law and this view had not been contested by the applicant. The Federal Court had moreover regarded the old-age pensions scheme in question as a collective insurance scheme (Gruppenversicherung), under which only the employers were considered to be insured, the employees (Arbeitnehmer) remaining mere beneficiaries (Bezugsberechtigte). Finally, the Federal Court had examined whether the amendment of the Fund’s rules had respected the interests of the employees and the principle of ""good faith"" (Treu und Glauben) and had taken the view that the measure in question had checked a development that was unacceptable socially and politically and had put an end to a situation that represented a considerable departure from the aims of the supplementary pensions scheme. In its opinion, the amendment of the rules was intended to consolidate all the old-age pensions schemes in order to meet the problems arising from economic and demographical changes and was based on a decision of principle taken by the employers’ and employees’ representatives. The concluded its reasoning in the following terms: ""This application of the civil law does not infringe any fundamental right. The objective protection afforded by the right of property is not undermined by the classification of the insurance contract as group insurance, in which the employees are mere beneficiaries, or in the assessment of their individual interests. The argument that the public interest, and notably the interest of all employees in the consolidation of their pensions schemes, called for a reform of those schemes is plausible and is in any event not open to criticism from the point of view of constitutional law. The interests of employees regarded as beneficiaries may be adequately protected by the organisations that represent them. In view of the superior interest of all civil service employees in having a sound and affordable pensions scheme, a collective defence of those interests would seem objectively appropriate, as it is the sole means of ensuring the necessary balancing of interests within the group. Whatever the case may be, the objective substance of the right of property does not require additional protection of the individual beneficiary. The same applies to the assessment of the merits of the new rules. This is based on both the principle of proportionality and the need to protect confidence in the preservation of acquired pension rights."" Nor, it added, did the reversal of case-law by the Federal Court, which had previously considered employees to be insured under the rules in question, interfere with the right of property, because case-law had no legislative force and could evolve. Finally, the observed that the amendment of the Fund’s rules did not breach the principle of equality before the law or that of the freedom of association. The applicant’s doubts as to the impartiality of the arbitrators were not relevant as the latter were not members of the judiciary, but sat on private-law arbitration tribunals. 18. The decision was notified to the applicant on 5 December 1991. 19. In the two years that followed the lodging of the applicant’s appeal in July 1988, the Second Section of the First Division dealt with twenty-four cases concerning the compatibility of the new rules of the Supplementary Pensions Fund with the Basic Law (Grundgesetz). Other appeals were lodged with it relating, inter alia, to redundancy notices served on employees (decision of 30 May 1991), an employer’s right to lock out strikers (decision of 26 June 1991) and the appeals filed by former civil servants of the German Democratic Republic challenging a provision of the Treaty on German Unification which terminated the employment contract of some 300,000 persons (decision of 24 April 1991). 20. Article 93 para. 1 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) provides as follows: ""The shall rule: ...> (a) on constitutional appeals which may be lodged by any person who considers that the public authorities have infringed one of his or her fundamental rights or one of his or her rights as guaranteed under Articles 20 (4), 33, 38, 101, 103 and 104 [of the Basic Law]."" 21. The composition and functioning of the are governed by the Federal Constitutional Court Act (Gesetz über das Bundesverfassungsgericht). 22. Sections 90 to 96 of that Act concern constitutional appeals lodged by individuals (see paragraph 20 above). At the material time the version adopted in 1985 (applicable with effect from 1 January 1986) was in force . Section 90 ""1. Any person who claims that one of his basic rights or one of his rights under Articles 20 (4), 33, 38, 101, 103 and 104 of the Basic Law has been violated by public authority may lodge a complaint of unconstitutionality with the .> If legal action against the violation is admissible, the complaint of unconstitutionality may not be lodged until all remedies have been exhausted. However, the may decide immediately on a complaint of unconstitutionality lodged before all remedies have been exhausted if it is of general relevance or if recourse to other courts first would entail a serious and unavoidable disadvantage for the complainant. ..."" Section 92 ""The reasons for the complaint shall specify the right which is claimed to have been violated and the act or omission of the organ or authority by which the complainant claims to have been harmed."" Section 93a ""A complaint of unconstitutionality shall require acceptance prior to a decision (Annahme zur Entscheidung)."" Section 93b ""(1) A section may refuse acceptance of a complaint of unconstitutionality by a unanimous order if (2) The section may uphold the complaint of unconstitutionality by a unanimous order if it is clearly justified because the has already decided on the relevant question of constitutional law ... (3) The decisions of the section shall be taken without oral pleadings. In stating the reasons for an order by which acceptance of a complaint of unconstitutionality is refused, it is sufficient to refer to the legal aspect determining the refusal."" Section 93c ""If the section neither refuses acceptance of a complaint of unconstitutionality nor upholds it, the division shall then decide on acceptance. It shall accept the complaint of unconstitutionality if at least two judges hold the view that a question of constitutional law is likely to be clarified by a decision or that the denial of a decision on the matter will entail a serious and unavoidable disadvantage for the complainant. Section 93b (3) above shall apply mutatis mutandis."" Section 94 provides for the right of third parties to be heard in appeal proceedings in the . Section 95 23. The Federal Constitutional Court Act was subsequently amended with a view to reducing the court’s workload. The amendments adopted in 1993 (which entered into force on 11 August 1993), among other things, reorganised the procedure for individual appeals (section 93a-93d of the Act).",1996,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

116,001-61550,Grand Chamber,"10.The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Devon.At the relevant time he was a serving member of the Royal Navy. 11.On 18 June 1998 he was convicted, pursuant to section 42 of the Naval Discipline Act 1957, by a naval court-martial of unlawfully and maliciously wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. He was sentenced to, inter alia, three years' imprisonment and to be dismissed from the service and reduced in rank. He was also ordered to pay GBP 700 compensation. 12.The court-martial comprised a President (a Captain of the Royal Navy), four naval officers (a Commander, 2 Lieutenant Commanders and a Lieutenant) and a Judge Advocate (Commander Flanagan). The Judge Advocate was a naval barrister who was working as the naval legal advisor to FLEET (the command responsible for the organisation and deployment of all ships at sea). His rank was lower than that of the President of the court-martial. The prosecution was conducted by a Lieutenant Commander of the staff of the Prosecuting Authority. The applicant chose to be represented by a naval barrister. The defending and prosecuting officers were junior in rank to the Judge Advocate and the defending officer was senior in rank to the prosecuting officer. 13.At the beginning of the court-martial the Judge Advocate directed the members of the court-martial as follows: “As Judge Advocate it's my role to ensure that the trial is conducted in accordance with the law and I am here to advise and guide you. I will have no role in the finding on the facts. You must accept what I say on matters of law and procedures [as] being correct. If you have any questions of me during the trial ... they must be asked of me in open Court in the presence of the accused, his friend and the prosecutor and any such questions should pass through you ... as President. That means ... that now that this trial has commenced, you and your court can have no direct communication with me except in open Court and therefore if I seem to avoid you outside the environs of the Court ... that's the reasoning behind that and please don't think I am being rude ... Now you and your colleagues may discuss the case when you are together and in private if you so wish, but my strong advice to you at this stage is to resist the temptation until you've heard all the evidence and indeed my own summing up. You must be particularly rigorous in not discussing the case at all during adjournments in the trial when you could be overheard by others such as during lunch in the Ward room where a room has been set aside for you and particularly overnight since you must not be influenced by anything said to you or which you observe which is not evidence in the trial. I will warn you of this ... each time we adjourn and particularly when we adjourn at the end of the days' proceedings.” 14.On 29 September 1998 the Navy Board decided not to vary the court-martial's verdict and sentence. In his advice to the Navy Board, the Judge Advocate of the Fleet commented that the trial had been “well conducted by all concerned”, that the main directions of law in the Judge Advocate's summing up were “impeccable” and that any errors were, in any event, favourable to the applicant. 15.On 30 June 1999 a single judge of the rejected his appeal, as did the full court on 20 January 2000. 16.The Armed Forces Act 1996 (“the 1996 Act”) came into effect on 1April 1997 and amended, inter alia, the Naval Discipline Act 1957 (references below to “the 1957 Act” are to that Act as amended). Naval courts-martial are regulated, inter alia, by the 1957 Act, by the Courts-Martial (Royal Navy) Rules 1997, as amended (“the 1997 Rules”) and by the Queen's Regulations for the Royal Navy (“QRRN”). 17.Section 42 of the 1957 Act provides that any person subject to naval law who commits a civilian offence, whether in the or elsewhere, shall be guilty of an offence against that section. 18.Section 43(1) of the 1957 Act lists the punishments available to a court-martial following conviction and establishes, as a matter of law, the relative positions of each punishment in the hierarchy of punishments available (the “Coda” to section 43(1) of the 1957 Act). 19.An allegation that a person subject to naval law has committed an offence must be reported to the CO of the accused. The CO must investigate the charge after which the CO may dismiss the charge, refer it to the Higher Authority or try the accused summarily. 20.The Higher Authority is a senior naval officer. Although he is not legally qualified, he is legally advised by a barrister. He must decide, in respect of cases referred to him by a CO, whether to refer the matter back to that CO to be dealt with summarily (unless the accused has already elected trial by court-martial); to refer the matter to the Prosecuting Authority for a decision as to whether the accused should be prosecuted; or to drop the charges. The Higher Authority's decision is essentially a command decision, the Higher Authority being required to ask himself whether there are service reasons for prosecuting or not. Once the Higher Authority has taken this decision, he has no further involvement in the case. 21.The role of prosecutor is performed by the Prosecuting Authority of the Royal Navy. The Prosecuting Authority is appointed by Her Majesty the Queen (section 52H of the 1957 Act) and is accountable to the Attorney-General for the performance of his prosecuting functions. 22.In almost all cases (88% of cases prosecuted in 2002 and up to mid-2003) the Prosecuting Authority appoints barristers to prosecute cases from his own staff, which barristers work exclusively for the Prosecuting Authority. On occasion, however, the Prosecuting Authority appoints prosecutors from a list of uniformed naval barristers who are eligible to act as prosecutors but who do not, in their general duties, work directly for the Prosecuting Authority (unlike in the army and air force where prosecutions are carried out exclusively by prosecutors on the staff of the relevant Prosecuting Authority). Such an officer may be working in a legal or non-legal post, but will always be outside the chain of command of the accused and will always be answerable for his duties as a prosecutor to the Prosecuting Authority. 23.Naval barristers appointed to act as prosecutors are members of the Bar of England and and are consequently subject to the professional arrangements and ethical duties of the Bar Code of Conduct (including a duty to act with independence and in the interests of justice). The Prosecuting Authority and all acting prosecutors also apply the Code for Service Prosecutors which has been endorsed by the Attorney General and which sets out how their duties should be carried out. 24.Following the Higher Authority's decision to refer a case to it, the Prosecuting Authority has an absolute discretion, applying similar criteria as those applied in civilian cases by the Crown Prosecution Service, to decide whether or not to prosecute and, if so, to determine precisely what charges should be brought. The Prosecuting Authority conducts the prosecution (Part II, Schedule I to the 1996 Act), which is brought on behalf of the Crown. 25.The NCAO is a civilian and a civil servant, working in “one of the secretariats dealing with naval service discipline policy issues”. The NCAO is responsible for making the arrangements for courts-martial, including arranging venue and timing, ensuring that a Judge Advocate and any court officials required will be available, securing the attendance of witnesses and selecting members of the court. The NCAO is appointed by the Defence Council. Before commencement of the court-martial hearing, the power to dissolve it is vested in the responsible NCAO. 26.Naval courts-martial consist of a President, four to eight serving naval officers of at least three years' military experience and a Judge Advocate (since the entry into force of the Armed Forces Act 2001 - “the 2001 Act” - warrant officers may also sit as members). The distinction made between district and general courts-martial in the army and air force does not exist in the Royal Navy. Contrary also to the position in the army and air force, the Royal Navy does not appoint, and has never appointed, Permanent Presidents of courts-martial (“PPCMs”). 27.In the Royal Navy the role undertaken by the Judge Advocate General (“JAG”) for the army and air force is divided between two appointments: the Judge Advocate of the Fleet (“JAF”) and the Chief Naval Judge Advocate (“CNJA”). 28.The JAF is an experienced civilian lawyer. The current JAF has been a circuit judge since 1992. He was appointed as JAF in 1995 by Her Majesty the Queen on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor, to whom the JAF is responsible. Section 73 of the 1957 Act provides: “Nothing in this part of the Act shall prejudice the exercise by the [JAF] of his functions of considering and reporting on the proceedings of courts-martial and disciplinary courts, or any other of his functions in relation to such courts.” The prime responsibility of the JAF is to review all naval courts-martial, save for those in which the accused pleads guilty, so as to be able to advise the Reviewing Authority whether or not they have been properly conducted according to law. If, in the opinion of the JAF, they have not been so conducted, he has the power to recommend to the Reviewing Authority that the conviction be quashed or that the finding of guilt or the sentence be altered. 29.The CNJA, on the other hand, is a service appointment. He is appointed by the First Sea Lord (Chief of Naval Staff) on the advice of the Naval Secretary and must be a barrister of suitable experience and rank. Save for his judicial role, he is responsible to the Second Sea Lord (Chief of Naval Personnel), who is the senior Admiral responsible for personnel policy. His judicial role is described as part of his ""ancillary duties"" for which he is solely responsible to the JAF. The CNJA's primary purpose is to be the principal advisor within the Royal Navy on all matters of law, including naval, criminal, employment, maritime and international law. His secondary purpose is to “ensure that sufficient naval officers are trained as barristers and thereafter appropriately appointed to legal billets to provide the legal services required by commands, including headquarters”. Among his “principal” tasks” is to assist the JAF and consult with him on matters of law and legal policy, to select officers for legal training and to supervise their duties. Sitting as Judge Advocate at complex courts-martial and appointing barristers to sit as Judge Advocates are among his “ancillary tasks” (section 53B(1) of the 1957 Act). 30.Any Judge Advocate sitting in a court-martial must have been qualified for at least five years (section 53B(2) of the 1957 Act). In addition, as a matter of policy, reflected in the CNJA's terms of reference, the Royal Navy has for many years appointed only serving officers as Judge Advocates. The reasons for this policy have been described by the current CNJA (Commodore Jeffrey Blackett) as follows: “... because they understand the particular and unique way of life of the Royal Navy, gained through their own operational experience. They can advise and direct the court in terms which reflect their detailed knowledge of the Service, and which therefore enhances the credibility of their role in the eyes of all the parties involved.” 31.The manner of appointment of a naval Judge Advocate is also different to the process in the army and the RAF. The appointment process is known as “ticketing”, a process which involves both the CNJA and the JAF. The CNJA regularly assesses the experience and qualities of those who are appropriately qualified, using the same criteria for judicial qualities as are applied by the Lord Chancellor for civilian judicial appointments. He then consults with the JAF as to suitability for appointment. The JAF will have had an opportunity to assess the qualities of such candidates and their suitability for ticketing since his review of the court-martial proceedings may also involve an assessment of the qualities of the prosecuting and defending barristers. With the JAF's agreement, the CNJA then writes to inform a successful candidate of his or her appointment or “ticketing”. Such an appointment is for an undefined period of time. A Judge Advocate, once ticketed, remains on the list until he or she leaves the service or voluntarily resigns from the list. No Judge Advocate has ever been removed from office, although some have voluntarily withdrawn because they have decided to concentrate on operational appointments within the Royal Navy. If the question ever arose, grounds for removal would be precisely the same as those for a civilian judge, and the decision would be taken by the JAF. Once “ticketed”, these officers gain experience by assisting at a court-martial with an experienced Judge Advocate. They then proceed to cases where they sit as Judge Advocate where the accused pleads guilty, so that sentencing is the only matter at issue. It is then for the CNJA to assess when the Judge Advocate in question is ready to officiate in contested cases. At that point Judge Advocates are appointed to individual cases by the CNJA, by his letter of appointment, but the practice is that there is no selection as the Judge Advocate is appointed by rota on a “cab rank” basis, the only criteria being that the Judge Advocate is not excluded by section 53C(4) of the 1957 Act or Rule 15 of the 1997 Rules. Accordingly, a list is kept by the NCAO of “ticketed” Judges Advocates, and the name at the top of the list is appointed to the next court-martial. That Judge Advocate's name then goes to the bottom of the list and such persons will not be appointed until his or her name rises to the top of the list again. Such ticketed barristers may be serving in either legal or non-legal appointments: those serving in legal appointments sit as Judge Advocates on average for about 20-30 days each year and those serving in non-legal appointments will normally sit for less. There are currently four practising Judge Advocates one of whom is serving in a Ministry of Defence appointment and is not therefore reported on by his Royal Navy superiors. 32.Judge Advocates are responsible solely to the JAF for the performance of their professional duties at courts-martial while in office. As noted above, the JAF reviews all contested courts-martial which result in a conviction. In advising the Reviewing Authority, the JAF will comment on the Judge Advocate's handling of the proceedings and his summing up. He may also pass “professional comments about the judicial performance to the CNJA”. At the time of the applicant's court-martial, there was a haphazard practice whereby the CNJA might provide a Judge Advocate's reporting officer, at that latter officer's request, with a synopsis of the JAF's comments on the Judge Advocate's performance. The Judge Advocate who officiated at the applicant's court-martial was not so reported upon and that practice has since ceased. The CNJA does not sit on any promotion board of any officer who has served as a Judge Advocate and has no control over or effect upon their promotion. Judge Advocates receive no additional or separate pay for duties in such office and their pay and promotion cannot be affected by their performance or status as a Judge Advocate. QRRN 3630, which came into force after the present court-martial, provides as follows: “3. It follows that Judge Advocates must be free from any supervision or restraint in order to carry out independently the duties required of them by law. In the conduct of their professional duties at courts-martial Judge Advocates are accountable, only in so far as the standard and performance of their duties is concerned, to the [JAF].> The [JAF] is solely responsible for reporting on the professional performance of Judge Advocates in the conduct of their duties in court-martial trials. No other personal report, assessment or other document is to be prepared or used to determine whether an officer conducting Judge Advocate duties is qualified to be promoted, or is qualified or suited for particular appointments or training. Where Judge Advocates are appointed to general appointments, or whilst carrying out their general duties, nothing in this article shall prevent the appropriate reports being prepared on them concerning their conduct of those duties, for promotion, appointing or training purposes.” 33.The appointment of the members of the court-martial proceeds by way of a random selection: the NCAO requests ships and establishments to nominate officers to serve as court-martial members. There was also a list of volunteers who had put their name forward as being available and prepared to sit as a court-martial member. (Since the entry into force of the 2001 Act, the appointment of members has been by way of a random selection from a computer generated database of eligible personnel). Section 53C(4)(b) of the 1957 Act excludes from selection for courts-martial the CAOs, the COs of the accused, members of the Higher Authority, investigating officers and all other officers involved in inquiring into the charges concerned. Rule 15 of the 1997 Rules also excludes an officer serving under the command of the Higher Authority referring the case, the Prosecuting Authority or the CAOs. The members of the court-martial are not legally qualified although most will have attended a previous court-martial as an observer. They will also have attended a Divisional Officer's Course where they will have received instruction on summary trials and many will have attended the Junior Staff Course which includes a lecture on Naval Discipline. 34.The members of a court-martial remain subject to naval discipline in the general sense since they remain naval officers, but this is subject to their not being reported on in relation to the carrying out by them of their duties as members of the court-martial and, in particular, in relation to their judicial decision-making. Attempting to influence, or influencing, a member of a court-martial amounts to the common law offence of perverting the course of justice and/or to the offence of conduct to the prejudice of good order and naval discipline (section 39 of the 1957 Act). 35.The President is responsible for conducting the trial in a manner befitting a court of justice and in accordance with the traditions of the Royal Navy (Rule 28(1) of the 1997 Rules). The post of Permanent President of Courts-Martial (“PPCM”), which existed in the air-force and army (the Cooper judgment, §§ 30-32) was never created in the Royal Navy. 36.When the members have been nominated and the court-martial has been convened, the members are sent the NCAO Briefing Notes for court-martial members (paragraphs 47-62 below) along with a list of prosecution witnesses. The members are required to examine the list and to inform the NCAO if any of the witnesses is known to them. They are also advised that, should they subsequently discover that they do know someone, they should advise the Judge Advocate. 37.At the outset of the court-martial, the names of the members of the court-martial (of the Judge Advocate, the President and of the ordinary members) are read out and an accused can object to any member of the court-martial. 38.The President and each ordinary member of a court-martial take the following oath: “I swear by almighty God that I will duly administer justice according to the law and without partiality, favour or affection; and I do further swear that I will not on any account, at any time whatsoever, disclose the vote or opinion of any member of this court-martial, unless thereunto required in due course of law.” The Judge Advocate takes the following oath: “I swear by almighty God that I will to the best of my ability carry out the duties of judge advocate according to law and without partiality, favour or affection; and I do further swear that I will not on any account at any time whatsoever disclose the vote or opinion of the President or [of] any member of this court-martial unless thereunto required in due course of law.” 39.Once the court-martial hearing has commenced, the power to dissolve it is vested in the Judge Advocate. At the court-martial the Judge Advocate sits apart from the court-martial members and has no contact with them (either during or outside the hours of sitting) other than appears on the record of the court-martial. A Judge Advocate's rulings on points of law are binding on the court-martial members and he or she delivers a summing up in open court before the court martial retires to consider its verdict. 40.Deliberations of the court-martial members are confidential, members being forbidden to reveal any opinion or vote. The Judge Advocate does not deliberate in private with the court-martial members on verdict and has no vote on this. The Judge Advocate will, however, sit in private with the court-martial members to deliberate on sentence and to give any advice on sentence required and he has a vote. Decisions on verdict and sentence are reached by majority vote (section62 of the 1957 Act). The casting vote on sentence, if needed, rests with the President of the court-martial, who also gives reasons for the sentence in open court. The members of the court are required to speak, and at the close of deliberations to vote, on verdict and sentence in ascending order of seniority. 41.All guilty verdicts reached, and sentences imposed by, a court-martial must be reviewed by the “Reviewing Authority” within prescribed time limits (section 70 of the 1957 Act). The Reviewing Authority is the Defence Council which has delegated its functions to the Navy Board (also known as the Admiralty Board) which in turn has delegated that task to the Naval Secretary. 42.Contested cases resulting in a conviction are (as noted above) scrutinised by the JAF who provides written advice to the Reviewing Authority as to the safety of the conviction and the conduct of the trial. For guilty pleas resulting in conviction, legal advice is provided to the Reviewing Authority by a senior naval barrister who is himself an experienced Judge Advocate but who does not continue to practice as a Judge Advocate for the duration of his tenure as advisor to the Reviewing Authority, for reasons concerning his independence from the “naval judiciary”. The accused may also petition the Reviewing Authority within 28 days following sentencing and the Reviewing Authority's procedure does not begin until after receipt of that petition or after the 28 day time-limit for its receipt. Post-trial advice to the Reviewing Authority (either from the JAF or the experienced naval barrister) is disclosed to the accused. Account will be taken of the petition, where one is submitted, in the advice given to the Reviewing Authority. 43.The Reviewing Authority gives a reasoned decision (Rule 75 of the 1997 Rules) and its verdict and sentence are treated for all purposes as if they were reached or imposed by the court-martial. The Reviewing Authority may substitute a finding of guilt which could have been made by the court-martial and if the court-martial must have been satisfied of the facts which would justify making that finding (section 71(2) of the 1957 Act). It may also “pass any such sentence (not being, in the opinion of the authority, more severe than the sentence originally passed) open to a court-martial on making such a finding as appears proper” (section 71(2) and (4) of the 1957 Act). According to section 71A of the 1957 Act, the Reviewing Authority can also quash any guilty verdict and associated sentence and make an order authorising a re-trial under the same conditions as the (see paragraphs 44-46 below). It is then for the Prosecuting Authority to decide whether to seek a re-trial. While the individual concerned is not heard by the Reviewing Authority specifically on the question of a re-trial, the decision of the Prosecuting Authority to seek a re-trial can be challenged as an abuse of process. If convicted on re-trial, the individual also retains his access on verdict and sentence to the . 44.The CMAC is a civilian court composed of judges from the criminal division of the Court of Appeal. A convicted person has a right of appeal to the CMAC against both conviction and sentence (section 8 of the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act 1968 as amended - “the 1968 Act”). 45.An appeal against conviction will be allowed where the CMAC finds that the conviction is unsafe, but dismissed in all other cases. The test of what is “unsafe” is the same as that applied in appeals against convictions from the civilian criminal courts. An appeal against sentence may be allowed where the CMAC considers that the sentence is not appropriate for the case (section 16A of the 1968 Act). The CMAC has power, inter alia, to call for the production of evidence and witnesses whether or not produced at the court-martial (section 28 of the 1968 Act). 46.In the case of R. v. McKendry (judgment of the CMAC of 20 February 2001), the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of absence without leave and was sentenced to, inter alia, 265 days' detention. The Reviewing Authority rejected his petition and Mr Justice Ouseley gave the judgment of the CMAC on appeal. Having noted in detail the advice of the JAG to the Reviewing Authority, he quoted as follows from a prior judgment of the CMAC (R. v. Pattinson, judgment of 25 January 1999): “In our judgment, the court has to bear in mind, in dealing with an appeal of this kind, ... the somewhat “hybrid jurisdiction” which [the CMAC] exercises; in that it is clearly free to correct any injustice, but it nonetheless has to be mindful that those imposing and confirming sentences, particularly, it is to be said ... in relation to an offence of desertion, are particularly well placed and indeed better placed than [the CMAC] in assessing the seriousness of offending in the context of service life”. Mr Justice Ouseley continued: “The offence of going absent without leave, as indeed the offence of desertion, is not one in respect of which any civilian parallel exists. The sentencing considerations involve factors that are particular to the armed services, in respect of which their judgment and experience are entitled to great weight. A court should be reluctant to interfere with such courts-martial sentencing decisions, particularly where the [JAG] has reviewed the matter and has dismissed the petition in the terms in which he did here. The considerations particular to this sort of military offence relate to the significance of the offence for the maintenance of military discipline and efficiency, the need for deterrence, the significance of rank and the availability of other measures from dismissal to loss of rank and pay, which are in many ways not available or not paralleled in the civilian sphere. Indeed some of those factors would also be of particular weight when the [CMAC] is dealing with offences which do have parallels in the civilian sphere, and would justify caution in interfering with courts-martial sentences; even more so do they justify caution when dealing with offences which have no parallel in the civilian sphere.” The case of R. v. Holtby-Smith (judgment of the CMAC of 26 February 2003) concerned a re-trial following a decision of the Reviewing Authority. Lord Justice Kennedy in the CMAC stated as follows: “The Reviewing Authority directed ... that the Prosecuting Authority consider whether there should be a re-trial. That was an inappropriate direction on the part of the Reviewing Authority because under section 113A of the [1955 Act] the decision whether or not to order a re-trial must be one for the Reviewing Authority itself and not for the Prosecuting Authority, though of course the Reviewing Authority could, if so disposed, canvas the views of the Prosecuting Authority, and of the proposed defendant, as to whether or not there should be a retrial. Following that, the Reviewing Authority was advised of the error of its approach and ... directed a retrial in the interests of justice. ... If [such a] decision of the Reviewing Authority was to be challenged, it could only be challenged by means of judicial review... .”. In the cases of R .v. Ball and R. v. Rugg (judgment of the CMAC, 12 February 1998), the sentence of the court-martial was one year's detention and the Reviewing Authority substituted a sentence of one year's imprisonment. The CMAC quashed the latter sentence and replaced it with a sentence of nine months' detention. 47.At the relevant time, the Briefing Notes described below were sent by the NCAO to the members (including the President) selected for a court-martial. 48.The introduction to the Briefing Notes provided as follows (The Order of Procedure booklet referred to in this introduction was not submitted by the Government to the Court): “1. These notes provide a guide to the roles and duties of Presidents and Members of the Court at naval courts-martial trials. They are not mandatory and officers must continue to exercise their judgement and discretion during the course of the trial. The purpose of these notes is to explain procedures and formalities, so that officers taking part for the first time can better understand their role and concentrate on the issues in the trial.> Officers selected to officiate will also find it useful to acquaint themselves with the Court-Martial Order of Procedure booklet (a copy of which is enclosed with these notes) although it is the Judge Advocate's responsibility to ensure that the procedures are followed. He will lead the President and the Members on matters of procedure throughout the trial, and will prompt them as required in the observance of the traditional formalities.” 49.Paragraph 1 of the Briefing Notes provided that: “The President is “responsible for conducting the trial in a manner befitting a court of justice and in accordance with the traditions of the Royal Navy” (Rule 28(1) [of the 1997 Rules]). Whilst these notes and the procedure booklet will prepare and arm Presidents to discharge this task, it is upon the Judge Advocate (who is also a member of the court) that Presidents should rely for advice and guidance on the discharge of this duty, and all matters associated with the trial. Judge Advocates are selected from the ranks of experienced naval barristers by the [CNJA]. It is their responsibility to ensure that the trial is conducted in accordance with the law, and they are trained and experienced in all matters concerning evidence and procedure and are accustomed to dealing with the many unforeseen difficulties inevitably faced by courts-martial.” 50.The Notes continued at paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 as follows: “2. Experience has shown that it is of paramount importance that Presidents confine themselves to their particular duty laid down in [1997 Rules], and do not allow themselves or their Court Members to treat the proceedings as a board of inquiry into any aspect of omission, neglect or wrong-doing by any person not charged and brought before the Court as an Accused. ...> Without exception such matters can be dealt with internally, without the need to draw attention to them outside the Service by pronouncement made in open court. The preferred course for dealing with such matters which may come to light during the trial ... is therefore for the Presidents to raise them with the appropriate Service authority after the trial has finished. ...> Presidents and Court Members should bear in mind that their duties in court can be exacting, onerous and require considerable patience; they should not therefore underestimate the demands that will be made of them. They must be prepared to concentrate on the issues in the trial without any distraction by their normal duties and responsibilities. ...” 51.Paragraphs 8-10 covered the opening procedure describing how the members of the court-martial would enter (indicating that the President would return the salutes of the uniformed personnel as appropriate) and how the parties could object to any member of the court-martial (which matter would be resolved, if necessary by the Judge Advocate), after which the sitting members would take their oaths. 52.Paragraph 11 dealt with the procedure in the case of a plea of not-guilty. It covered the Prosecutor's opening statement, the examination in chief, cross-examination and re-examination of witnesses, questions of witnesses by the Judge Advocate and the President, closing addresses by the prosecution and defence. It also indicated that, at the discretion of the President, it would be permissible and often helpful (particularly to the uniformed advocates) to relax swords during the course of the trial. It went on to advise that: “(i) The Judge Advocate will then direct the Court on the legal issues they must consider, and will summarise the evidence in a neutral way. He will define the elements of the offences and any other relevant law, give the Court simple guidance on how it applies to the issues in the case, and usually invite them to approach their consideration of the case by addressing a number of questions that will direct their minds to the issue of innocence or guilt. The Court will find it helpful to make a note of any questions the Judge Advocate poses. (j) The Court will then retire to consider its verdict. They must not separate nor communicate with anyone whilst doing so. If they have further questions about any aspect of the case, then the President must re-open the Court and put those questions to the Judge Advocate on the record. Having come to their finding, and having completed the Finding Sheet which has been left with them (and which the Judge Advocate will have explained in his summing up) the President re-opens the Court, the Clerk collects the Finding Sheet and the Judge Advocate reads the finding. In the event of any finding of guilt, the Court hears mitigation and then retires (this time with the Judge Advocate present to advise them) to consider their sentence. ...” 53.Paragraph 12 dealt with questions to witnesses by the members (other than the President and the Judge Advocate) and pointed out that if they were in doubt about a question then the President could seek the Judge Advocate's advice in open court before any question was asked. 54.Paragraphs 13 and 14 dealt with the Judge Advocate's rulings on the admissibility of evidence and on any submission by the accused that there was no case to answer in the absence of the other members of the court-martial. Paragraph 14 concluded that “like all of the Judge Advocate's rulings on matters of law, the Court are bound to follow his direction.” 55.Paragraph 15 of the Notes provided: “The Court are the sole judges of the facts and weigh the evidence to establish innocence or guilt. They are bound by the Judge Advocate's directions on the law and must take any advice on the law and procedure exclusively from him. During the trial, the Court may find that they have questions which they wish to address to the Judge Advocate; such questions must be asked in open court in the presence of the Accused (and his Accused Friend and the Prosecutor) and the Judge Advocate's reply must also be on the record. This means that once the trial has commenced, the Court can have no direct communication with the Judge Advocate except in open court.” 56.Paragraph 16 of the Notes further stated: “As the sole judges of the facts the Court must appear to be, and remain throughout, impartial. It is important that not only is justice done, but that it is seen to be done.” 57.Paragraph 17 of the Notes warned members that: “The Court must not be tempted to reach a decision before they have heard all the evidence for both prosecution and defence. ...” 58.Paragraph 18 of the Briefing Notes recalled that: “... [The members' notes] should be left behind and will be destroyed by the Clerk once the trial is over.” 59.Paragraph 19 of the Notes contained the following guidance: “The Court should not be tempted to discuss the case amongst themselves until they have heard all the evidence and the Judge Advocate's summing up. They must be rigorous in not discussing the case outside their number at all during the adjournments, particularly overnight, since they may be influenced, even subconsciously, by anything said to them which is not evidence in the trial. The Judge Advocate is required, as a matter of law, to remind them of this before any adjournment of any length.” 60.Paragraph 21 of the Briefing Notes provided: “After a plea of Guilty or a finding of Guilt, the Judge Advocate will retire with the remainder of the Court to advise on and consider sentence with them in closed court. The Judge Advocate will advise the Court of the sentencing options available in the case. Sentencing is a matter for the court's discretion and judgment, but the Judge Advocate will advise them on the appropriate level and type of sentence, based on naval sentencing practice and (where appropriate in more serious cases) Court of Appeal sentencing guidelines, as well as his experience. The Court will be invited to consider and, if necessary, vote on the sentence to be awarded, in which case the normal tradition of the Service should be followed: the junior member should vote first, followed by the other Members of the Court and the President, in ascending order of seniority. The Judge Advocate is a member of the Court, and if necessary, has the penultimate vote on sentence before the President, who himself has an additional casting vote in the event of an equal division of votes. That said, it is the customary and proper practice for naval courts-martial to try and achieve a consensus opinion on the appropriate sentence in the first instance.” 61.Paragraph 22 of the Briefing Notes added that: “Following pleas or findings of Guilt in the case of officers, the Clerk of the Court (at the Judge Advocate's prompting) will observe the tradition of the Service by turning the point of the Accused's sword to face him.” 62.Paragraph 23 concerned announcing and giving reasons for a sentence and read as follows: “Increasingly it is the practice of the civil court judges to announce in open court the reasons behind any particular sentence they have awarded. This has been the practice of naval courts-martial for some time and is now a statutory requirement. The procedure is as follows: (a) The Court, with the assistance and advice of the Judge Advocate, will determine the appropriate sentence in closed court. ... (c) The Judge Advocate will also, together with the President, draft a statement of the reasons why the Court has awarded the particular sentence, which will be designed for public consumption. This statement of the reasons for sentence will be included in the signal publishing the result of the court-martial which receives a navy-wide distribution.” 63.In 2002 the naval Higher Authority referred 103 cases to the Prosecuting Authority for a decision whether or not to prosecute and 26 of those cases were discontinued before trial. 64.In the year 2002 the rate of acquittals in contested naval courts-martial was 59%. The rate of acquittals in contested Crown Court trials has been: Year end to March 1999 – 42.8% Year end to March 2000 – 42.8 Year end to March 2001 – 44.3% Year end to March 2002 – 42% Year to December 2002 – 37.4%",2003,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT, EVEN IF THE NAVAL JUDGE ADVOCATE APPOINTED TO THE APPLICANT'S COURT-MARTIAL COULD BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENT DESPITE THE REPORTING MATTERS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH, THE POSITION OF NAVAL JUDGE ADVOCATES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED TO CONSTITUTE A STRONG GUARANTEE OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF A NAVAL COURT-MARTIAL.
88.  MOREOVER, THE COURT FINDS UNCONVINCING THE GOVERNMENT'S EXPLANATIONS AS TO WHY A SERVING OFFICER WAS TO BE PREFERRED AS JUDGE ADVOCATE IN NAVAL COURTS-MARTIAL WHEREAS THE JAG AND THE JUDGE ADVOCATES INVOLVED AIR-FORCE COURTS-MARTIAL WERE CIVILIANS.
THE GOVERNMENT REFERRED, IN THE FIRST PLACE, TO THE RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF NAVAL COURTS-MARTIAL. HOWEVER, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THIS ONLY MEANS THAT FEWER NAVAL JUDGE ADVOCATES WOULD BE REQUIRED. THEY ALSO RELIED UPON THE KNOWLEDGE A NAVAL OFFICER WOULD HAVE OF THE UNIQUE LANGUAGE, CUSTOMS AND ENVIRONMENT OF THE ROYAL NAVY. HOWEVER, SINCE THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTION OF THE JUDGE ADVOCATE IS TO ENSURE THE LAWFULNESS AND FAIRNESS OF THE COURT-MARTIAL AND TO DIRECT THE COURT ON POINTS OF LAW, IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY A DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF THE WAY OF LIFE AND LANGUAGE OF THE NAVY SHOULD BE CALLED FOR, PARTICULARLY WHERE, AS IN THE PRESENT CASE, THE OFFENCE WITH WHICH THE APPLICANT WAS CHARGED WAS THE ORDINARY CRIMINAL OFFENCE OF MALICIOUS WOUNDING. IN ANY EVENT, THE COURT IS NOT PERSUADED THAT A CIVILIAN JUDGE ADVOCATE WOULD HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY IN FOLLOWING NAVAL LANGUAGE OR CUSTOMS THAN A TRIAL JUDGE WOULD HAVE WITH COMPLEX EXPERT EVIDENCE IN A CIVILIAN CASE.
THE GOVERNMENT FURTHER RELIED ON THE NEED FOR THE NAVAL COURT-MARTIAL SYSTEM TO BE “FLEXIBLE” AND “PORTABLE” BECAUSE OF THE PARTICULARLY MOBILE NATURE OF THE NAVY. NAVAL JUDGE ADVOCATES WERE THEREFORE PREFERABLE AS, INTER ALIA, THEY WOULD HAVE “READY ACCESS” TO THE AREA IN QUESTION AND WOULD BE BETTER PREPARED FOR THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS OF WORKING AT SEA. HOWEVER, THE COURT DOES NOT FIND THIS RELEVANT GIVEN THE GOVERNMENT'S CLARIFICATION (IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS AT THE ORAL HEARING) THAT NAVAL COURTS-MARTIAL HAVE IN FACT BEEN HELD ON LAND SINCE 1986 IN TWO TRIAL CENTRES (PORTSMOUTH AND PLYMOUTH) REGARDLESS OF THE PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH THE OFFENCE WAS ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED.
89.  ACCORDINGLY, THE LACK OF A CIVILIAN IN THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF JUDGE ADVOCATE DEPRIVES A NAVAL COURT-MARTIAL OF ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT GUARANTEES OF INDEPENDENCE ENJOYED BY OTHER SERVICES' COURTS-MARTIAL (ARMY AND AIR-FORCE COURT-MARTIAL SYSTEMS BEING THE SAME FOR ALL RELEVANT PURPOSES – THE COOPER JUDGMENT, § 107), FOR THE ABSENCE OF WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAVE OFFERED NO CONVINCING EXPLANATION.
90.  SIXTHLY AND FINALLY, THE COURT CONSIDERS THE BRIEFING NOTES SENT TO MEMBERS OF NAVAL COURTS-MARTIAL TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS DETAILED AND SIGNIFICANTLY LESS CLEAR THAN THE CMAU (RAF) BRIEFING NOTES EXAMINED IN DETAIL IN THE ABOVE-CITED COOPER CASE (SEE PARAGRAPHS 45-62 OF THAT JUDGMENT). THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THEY ARE CONSEQUENTLY LESS EFFECTIVE IN SAFEGUARDING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE ORDINARY MEMBERS OF COURTS-MARTIAL FROM INAPPROPRIATE OUTSIDE INFLUENCE.
91.  THE COURT ACCORDINGLY FINDS THAT THE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THE AIR-FORCE COURT-MARTIAL SYSTEM ASSESSED IN THE ABOVE-CITED COOPER CASE AND NAVAL COURT-MARTIAL SYSTEM AT ISSUE IN THE PRESENT CASE ARE SUCH THAT THE PRESENT APPLICANT'S MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY OF HIS NAVAL COURT-MARTIAL, CONVENED UNDER THE 1996 ACT, CAN BE CONSIDERED TO BE OBJECTIVELY JUSTIFIED. HIS COURT-MARTIAL PROCEEDINGS WERE CONSEQUENTLY UNFAIR (SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, SMITH AND FORD V. THE UNITED KINGDOM, NOS. 37475/97 AND 39036/97, § 25, 29 SEPTEMBER 1999 AND MOORE AND GORDON V. THE UNITED KINGDOM, NOS. 36529/97 AND 37393/97, § 24, 29 SEPTEMBER 1999).
THERE HAS THEREFORE BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION.
III.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION
92.  ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION PROVIDES:
“IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION OR THE PROTOCOLS THERETO, AND IF THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTY CONCERNED ALLOWS ONLY PARTIAL REPARATION TO BE MADE, THE COURT SHALL, IF NECESSARY, AFFORD JUST SATISFACTION TO THE INJURED PARTY.”
93.  THE APPLICANT MADE NO CLAIM IN RESPECT OF PECUNIARY OR NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE AND THE COURT SEES NO REASONS TO MAKE ANY SUCH AWARD.
A. COSTS AND EXPENSES
94.  THE APPLICANT CLAIMED REIMBURSEMENT OF HIS LEGAL COSTS AND EXPENSES. HE REQUESTED A TOTAL AMOUNT OF 21,100 POUNDS STERLING (“GBP”) IN RESPECT OF BOTH THE PRESENT AND THE ABOVE-CITED COOPER CASE (THE LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE BEING THE SAME IN BOTH CASES). THESE COSTS ARE SAID TO REPRESENT LEGAL WORK OF SOME 134 HOURS COSTED AT GBP 150 PER HOUR TOGETHER WITH CERTAIN TRAVEL AND ACCOMMODATION EXPENSES RELATED TO THE HEARING HELD IN THE PRESENT AND THE COOPER CASES.
95.  THE GOVERNMENT NOTED THAT FEW DETAILS CONCERNING, OR DOCUMENTATION SUBSTANTIATING, THE COSTS AND EXPENSES CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN INCURRED HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED. THEY DID NOT ACCEPT THAT THE COSTS AND EXPENSES, EVEN IF INCURRED, WERE NECESSARILY INCURRED OR REASONABLE AS TO QUANTUM. THEY SUGGESTED THAT THE COURT SHOULD AWARD NO MORE THAN GBP 5000 IN RESPECT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES.
96.  THE  COURT RECALLS THAT ONLY LEGAL COSTS AND EXPENSES FOUND TO HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY AND NECESSARILY INCURRED AND WHICH ARE REASONABLE AS TO QUANTUM ARE RECOVERABLE UNDER ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION (SEE, AMONG OTHER AUTHORITIES, SMITH AND GRADY V. THE UNITED KINGDOM (JUST SATISFACTION), NOS. 33985/96 AND 33986/96, § 28, ECHR 2000IX).
97. IT NOTES THAT IT HAS FOUND A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 IN THE PRESENT CASE AND CONSIDERS IT APPROPRIATE TO MAKE AN AWARD IN RESPECT OF THE APPLICANT'S REASONABLE LEGAL COSTS AND EXPENSES.
ON THE ONE HAND, THE COURT OBSERVES THAT THE APPLICANT REFERRED GENERALLY TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE LEGAL WORK COMPLETED WITHOUT INDICATING IN ANY WAY HOW MUCH TIME WAS SPENT ON WHICH ASPECT. NEITHER WAS THERE ANY INDICATION AS TO THE DIVISION OF LEGAL WORK BETWEEN THE PRESENT CASE AND THE COOPER CASE TO WHICH CASES THE TOTAL LEGAL COSTS AND EXPENSES' CLAIM RELATED. FURTHER, THERE IS, IN THE COURT'S OPINION, CONSIDERABLE OVERLAP BETWEEN THESE TWO RELATED CASES. MOREOVER, THE APPLICANT DID NOT CLARIFY WHETHER THE SUMS CLAIMED WERE INCLUSIVE OR EXCLUSIVE OF VALUE-ADDED-TAX (“VAT”). ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PRESENT CASE REQUIRED AN EXAMINATION IN THE GRAND CHAMBER AS WELL AS AN ORAL HEARING (TOGETHER WITH THE ABOVE-CITED COOPER CASE) ON THE ADMISSIBILITY AND MERITS OF THE APPLICANT'S COMPLAINT.
98.  MAKING ITS ASSESSMENT ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS, THE COURT AWARDS THE SUM OF 8000 EUROS (“EUR”) IN RESPECT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES (WHICH SUM IS TO BE CONVERTED INTO POUNDS STERLING AT THE RATE APPLICABLE ON THE DATE OF SETTLEMENT AND WHICH IS INCLUSIVE OF ANY VAT WHICH MAY BE CHARGEABLE) LESS THE LEGAL AID AMOUNT TO BE PAID BY THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE.
B.  DEFAULT INTEREST
99.  THE COURT CONSIDERS IT APPROPRIATE THAT THE DEFAULT INTEREST SHOULD BE BASED ON THE MARGINAL LENDING RATE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, TO WHICH SHOULD BE ADDED THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS.
FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY
1.  DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE;
2.  HOLDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION;
3.  HOLDS
(A)  THAT THE RESPONDENT STATE IS TO PAY THE APPLICANT, WITHIN THREE MONTHS, EUR 8000 (EIGHT THOUSAND EUROS) IN RESPECT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES (A SUM TO BE CONVERTED INTO POUNDS STERLING AT THE RATE APPLICABLE ON THE DATE OF SETTLEMENT AND WHICH IS INCLUSIVE OF ANY VAT WHICH MAY BE CHARGEABLE) LESS THE LEGAL AID AMOUNT TO BE PAID BY THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE; AND
(B)  THAT FROM THE EXPIRY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED THREE MONTHS UNTIL SETTLEMENT SIMPLE INTEREST SHALL BE PAYABLE ON THE ABOVE AMOUNT AT A RATE EQUAL TO THE MARGINAL LENDING RATE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK DURING THE DEFAULT PERIOD PLUS THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS;
4.  DISMISSES THE REMAINDER OF THE APPLICANT'S CLAIM FOR JUST SATISFACTION.
"
5,001-58495,Grand Chamber,"4.At the time of the introduction of the application, the applicant was serving a prison sentence. The background to his conviction is as follows. On 30 June 1993 approximately three tonnes of cannabis resin was imported into the United Kingdom concealed in a consignment of frozen meat on a lorry travelling from Zeebrugge to Dover. There had been two previous importations of meat from the same consignor in May and early June 1993, both of which had been collected by a firm of hauliers called Davidsons. On this occasion, the meat was delivered to West Kent Cold Storage at Dunton Green, near Sevenoaks in Kent.>On 1 July 1993 Customs and Excise officers were keeping the applicant under observation. At approximately 6 a.m. he was followed from his home in Walthamstow, East London, to a lorry park at Beckton, where he collected an articulated lorry and refrigerated trailor which he had bought the previous month. He drove the lorry to West Kent Cold Storage, where he loaded the consignment of meat onto the lorry, and then drove on to a lock-up garage in Leytonstone, East London. He backed the trailor into the garage and drove away in his car. He made two brief visits to the garage during the morning, and then returned at approximately 1 p.m.>The applicant remained inside the garage for about five hours and was arrested just before 6 p.m. as he was leaving. The garage was searched. Six of the ten pallets of meat were still on the lorry in a frozen state, although the refrigerator motor was not operative. Four of the pallets, containing a large quantity of cannabis resin, had been opened and left to defrost in the unrefrigerated garage. The applicant told Customs officers that he worked as a haulage contractor and had not known that the meat contained cannabis.>In addition, Customs officers found that the applicant's daughter had rented a safety deposit box on 19 March 1993, of which the applicant, using the name of “Eric Siggins” was an authorised signatory. Following the applicant's arrest on 5 August the box was searched and found to contain GBP 24,100 in cash and two passports bearing the applicant's photograph, the first in his true name and the second in the name of Eric Siggins. Also found in the box were two documents dated 30 June, the date of the applicant's arrest.>The applicant was charged with an offence of being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition on the importation of cannabis, and remanded for trial in the Southwark Crown Court.>On 14 January 1994, shortly before the commencement of the trial, the prosecution made an ex parte application to the trial judge to withhold material in its possession on the grounds of public interest immunity. The defence were notified that an application was to be made, but were not informed of the category of material which the prosecution sought to withhold. They were given the opportunity to outline the defence case to the trial judge, namely that the applicant had collected the consignment of meat pursuant to instructions received by telephone the previous night, and had not been aware that the meat contained cannabis, and to request the judge to order disclosure of any evidence relating to these alleged facts. The trial judge examined the material in question and ruled that it should not be disclosed. The defence were not informed of the reasons for the judge's decision. 10.On 18 January 1994 the defence served the following written request on the prosecution: “9.The Crown are formally asked to indicate (a) in general whether there is unused material in connection with this case, apart from the subject-matter of the ex parte application to the Court on Friday 14 January 1994 ... which has not been disclosed and (b) in particular: (i)whether any listening device or telephone intercept was used, and whether there exists any resulting recording, note, memorandum, or other record; (ii)whether there exists any note, memorandum or other record of any interview with, or statement by any witness or potential witness in this case that has not already been disclosed; (iii)whether there exists any evidence ... of any observations on the lorry ... or on the premises of West Kent Cold Storage, and if not, whether any such observations were in fact carried out; (iv)whether there were any other observations carried out in connection with this enquiry that have not been disclosed; (v)whether any enquiries were made to trace the vehicles and/or drivers used for the first two Davidson & Sons collections from West Kent Cold Store, and if so, with what result; (vi)whether HM Customs and Excise acted in this enquiry on any 'information received' and if so, whether there exists any log, memorandum, or other record of any such information.” 11.Prosecution counsel provided the answer to questions 9(iii) and (vi), informing the defence that there had been no such observations and no “information received” from an informant, but declined to answer the remainder of the questions. The defence therefore applied to the trial judge for an order that the prosecution should provide the information requested. The application was heard on 24 January 1994, when prosecution counsel submitted: “I have refused and still refuse to answer the questions set out in ... paragraph 9 because I contend that I am not required to reveal to any person whether there has been any interception of communications under the [Interception of Communications] Act [see paragraphs 31-34 below]. If I answer the question at 9(a) or 9(b), I shall be answering that question which I am not required to answer. ... I am confident I have done what is required of me in respect of it. ... I take the view that were there to be any matter falling under the Interception of Communications Act it should not be the subject of any ex parte application ... .” 12.That position was upheld by the trial judge who, in his ruling of 24January 1994, stated inter alia: “I cannot invite [prosecution counsel] ... to go behind the stand that he is taking, at this stage, where he takes the view that even an ex parte application is unnecessary, which is the way he looks at it. ... I think we have taken the matter as far as we can in that particular aspect. One is bound, because I have no power [to order] otherwise, to accept the situation as the prosecutor tells it to be.” 13.The applicant did not give evidence at his trial. The defence case was that he had no knowledge of the cannabis hidden in the consignment and was acting as an innocent haulier of the goods. He was attempting to establish a haulage business (“Ejay Couriers”) and had bought vehicles and hired the lock-up garage for that purpose. It was submitted on his behalf that in collecting the meat he had been acting pursuant to instructions from another firm of hauliers, as was shown by a note, found in the applicant's possession at the time of his arrest, on Ejay Couriers headed paper of a telephone call made by Davidsons (see paragraph 1 above) at 7.30 p.m. on 30 June 1993. 14.On 31 January 1994 the applicant was convicted of the offence charged and on 21 March 1994 he was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. 15.The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, on the following grounds: “It was clear that not all unused material had been disclosed. ... In open court it was stated on behalf of the defendant that the unused material was of potential importance to his defence that he had no knowledge that drugs were to be or were concealed in the load he carried, and that he had received his instructions for the collection by telephone, in the course of his business as a haulier, very shortly before 1 July 1993. ... Any information therefore that might have led to his being able to confirm either the source or content of those instructions, as well as to trace those who had involved him in a smuggling enterprise was of obvious importance. The Crown had declined to answer the question whether any potentially relevant material, apart from the subject-matter of the ex parte application, had not been disclosed, on the grounds that to do so would reveal whether or not there had been a telephone intercept. It was plain from the course of the argument that the ex parte application had not dealt with any telephone intercept, since the Crown argued that this was the province solely of the prosecutor, and not that of the judge, a proposition based on R. v. Preston [see paragraph 34 below]. In these circumstances the defence were entitled to know at least the category of material with which that application did not deal. ... Furthermore, the Crown should have been called upon to justify, ex parte if necessary, the stance taken in relation to the other unused material. ... Since there must have been a reason for watching the defendant, which was explained neither by the evidence adduced, nor by that served but excluded by agreement, and since it was said that there was no informant involved in the case, there is a strong likelihood that disclosable information, bearing directly upon the defendant's case, was in the possession of the prosecution.” 16.On 13 February 1995, prior to the hearing of the appeal, defence counsel applied to the Court of Appeal for an order that the defence should be given a transcript of the ex parte hearing of 14January 1994, to enable them to argue the non-disclosure as a ground of appeal. Defence counsel outlined the applicant's case, namely that the instructions for the collection of the load had been received by telephone very shortly before 1 July 1993, and submitted that any information that might be in the Crown's possession and which could, directly or indirectly, support the defence case, should have been disclosed. 17.The Court of Appeal, which had before it the transcript of the ex parte hearing of 14January 1994 and the material which had been its subject-matter, declined to order the disclosure of either to the defence on the following grounds: “The application is made, correctly, on the ground that if the matters which emerged during the ex parte hearing are relevant, or likely to have been relevant, to the defence of Mr Jasper, he should be permitted to have sight of the ruling and the transcript of the proceedings which took place on that occasion. We have read the record and it seems ... that the learned judge ... knew precisely the scope of the application and listened with the greatest possible care to the matters which were placed before him. He tested those matters, and he came to the conclusion that the ruling which he made was appropriate in all the circumstances. It is abundantly clear from the transcript that he throughout was very careful to ensure and to explore whether the material was relevant, or likely to be relevant to the defence which had been indicated to him. In these circumstances, it is impossible for this court to say that the learned judge erred in principle in adopting the course that he did, or that the prosecution erred in principle and we see no ground to set aside the order that the learned judge made on that occasion.” 18.On 28 March 1995 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal. The first ground of appeal, namely the non-disclosure of relevant evidence, was rejected in the following terms: “The first [ground of appeal] ... related to matters to which the label 'unused material' is commonly given in these courts. It concerned the natural and proper desire of those instructed on behalf of the appellant to make sure, in so far as they could, that no documents or leads of any other sort existed which the Crown ought, as a matter of duty, to disclose to the defence if there was a real or a possible or more than a fanciful chance that disclosure of those documents or those leads might assist the defence. ... There is no suggestion, nor any ground for a suggestion, that the Crown were in any way in dereliction of their duty of good faith in making disclosure of anything that ought properly to be disclosed.” The court continued: “This was a case of enormous strength so far as the prosecution were concerned. The appellant had been caught red handed with a huge amount of cannabis resin. He was exercising a proprietorial form of control over the packages. He was unloading them and opening them up. By opening them he was allowing what were ostensibly their sole contents to defreeze, with a risk (to put it no higher) of their becoming valueless. He was not the consignee of the meat. [He] neither called nor gave evidence. That, of course, was his right, as the jury were ... directed, but it had the result that the jury were without any explanation whatsoever as to what, on his case, he was about. It is difficult, if not impossible, to see what other inference than that he was indeed guilty of the offence charged any reasonable jury could have reached. We dismiss this appeal.” 19.At common law, the prosecution has a duty to disclose any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial. The duty also extends to statements of any witnesses potentially favourable to the defence. 20.In December 1981 the Attorney-General issued Guidelines, which did not have the force of law, concerning exceptions to the common law duty to disclose to the defence certain evidence of potential assistance to it ((1982) 74 Cr. App. R. 302 (“the Guidelines”)). The Guidelines attempted to codify the rules of disclosure and to define the prosecution's power to withhold “unused material”. Under paragraph 1, “unused material” was defined as: “(i) All witness statements and documents which are not included in the committal bundle served on the defence; (ii) the statements of any witnesses who are to be called to give evidence at the committal and (if not in the bundle) any documents referred to therein; (iii) the unedited version(s) of any edited statements or composite statement included in the committal bundles.” Under paragraph 2, any item falling within this definition was to be made available to the defence if “... it has some bearing on the offence(s) charged and the surrounding circumstances of the case”. 21.According to the Guidelines, the duty to disclose was subject to a discretionary power for prosecuting counsel to withhold relevant evidence if it fell within one of the categories set out in paragraph 6. One of these categories (6(iv)) was “sensitive” material which, because of its sensitivity, it would not be in the public interest to disclose. “Sensitive material” was defined as follows: “... (a) it deals with matters of national security; or it is by, or discloses the identity of, a member of the Security Services who would be of no further use to those services once his identity became known; (b) it is by, or discloses the identity of an informant and there are reasons for fearing that the disclosure of his identity would put him or his family in danger; (c) it is by, or discloses the identity of a witness who might be in danger of assault or intimidation if his identity became known; (d) it contains details which, if they became known, might facilitate the commission of other offences or alert someone not in custody that he is a suspect; or it discloses some unusual form of surveillance or method of detecting crime; (e) it is supplied only on condition that the contents will not be disclosed, at least until a subpoena has been served upon the supplier - e.g. a bank official; (f) it relates to other offences by, or serious allegations against, someone who is not an accused, or discloses previous convictions or other matters prejudicial to him; (g) it contains details of private delicacy to the maker and/or might create risk of domestic strife.” According to paragraph 8, “in deciding whether or not statements containing sensitive material should be disclosed, a balance should be struck between the degree of sensitivity and the extent to which the information might assist the defence”. The decision as to whether or not the balance in a particular case required disclosure of sensitive material was one for the prosecution, although any doubt should be resolved in favour of disclosure. If either before or during the trial it became apparent that a duty to disclose had arisen, but that disclosure would not be in the public interest because of the sensitivity of the material, the prosecution would have to be abandoned. 22.Since 1992 the Guidelines have been superseded by the common law, notably by a number of decisions of the Court of Appeal. In R. v. Ward ([1993] vol. 1 Weekly Law Reports p. 619) the Court of Appeal dealt with the duties of the prosecution to disclose evidence to the defence and the proper procedure to be followed when the prosecution claimed public interest immunity. It stressed that the court and not the prosecution was to be the judge of where the proper balance lay in a particular case, because: “... [When] the prosecution acted as judge in their own cause on the issue of public interest immunity in this case they committed a significant number of errors which affected the fairness of the proceedings. Policy considerations therefore powerfully reinforce the view that it would be wrong to allow the prosecution to withhold material documents without giving any notice of that fact to the defence. If, in a wholly exceptional case, the prosecution are not prepared to have the issue of public interest immunity determined by a court, the result must inevitably be that the prosecution will have to be abandoned.” The Court of Appeal described the balancing exercise to be performed by the judge as follows: “... a judge is balancing on the one hand the desirability of preserving the public interest in the absence of disclosure against, on the other hand, the interests of justice. Where the interests of justice arise in a criminal case touching and concerning liberty or conceivably on occasion life, the weight to be attached to the interests of justice is plainly very great indeed”. 23.In R. v. Trevor Douglas K (vol. 97 Criminal Appeal Reports p.342), the Court of Appeal emphasised that in performing the balancing exercise referred to in Ward, the court must view the material itself: “In our judgment the exclusion of the evidence without an opportunity of testing its relevance and importance amounted to a material irregularity. When public interest immunity is claimed for a document, it is for the court to rule whether the claim should be upheld or not. To do that involves a balancing exercise. The exercise can only be performed by the judge himself examining or viewing the evidence, so as to have the facts of what it contains in mind. Only then can he be in a position to balance the competing interests of public interest immunity and fairness to the party claiming disclosure.” This judgment also clarified that where an accused appeals to the Court of Appeal on the grounds that material has been wrongly withheld, the Court of Appeal will itself view the material ex parte. 24.In R. v. Davis, Johnson and Rowe ([1993] vol. 1 Weekly Law Reports p. 613), the Court of Appeal held that it was not necessary in every case for the prosecution to give notice to the defence when it wished to claim public interest immunity, and outlined three different procedures to be adopted. The first procedure, which had generally to be followed, was for the prosecution to give notice to the defence that they were applying for a ruling by the court and indicate to the defence at least the category of the material which they held. The defence then had the opportunity to make representations to the court. Secondly, however, where the disclosure of the category of the material in question would in effect reveal that which the prosecution contended should not be revealed, the prosecution should still notify the defence that an application to the court was to be made, but the category of the material need not be disclosed and the application should be ex parte. The third procedure would apply in an exceptional case where to reveal even the fact that an ex parte application was to be made would in effect be to reveal the nature of the evidence in question. In such cases the prosecution should apply to the court ex parte without notice to the defence. 25.The Court of Appeal observed that although ex parte applications limited the rights of the defence, in some cases the only alternative would be to require the prosecution to choose between following an inter partes procedure or declining to prosecute, and in rare but serious cases the abandonment of a prosecution in order to protect sensitive evidence would be contrary to the public interest. It referred to the important role performed by the trial judge in monitoring the views of the prosecution as to the proper balance to be struck and remarked that even in cases in which the sensitivity of the information required an ex parte hearing, the defence had “as much protection as can be given without pre-empting the issue”. Finally, it emphasised that it was for the trial judge to continue to monitor the position as the trial progressed. Issues might emerge during the trial which affected the balance and required disclosure “in the interests of securing fairness to the defendant”. For this reason it was important for the same judge who heard any disclosure application also to conduct the trial. 26.In R. v. Keane ([1994] vol. 1 Weekly Law Reports p. 747) the Court of Appeal emphasised that, since the ex parte procedure outlined in R. v. Davis, Johnson and Rowe was “contrary to the general principle of open justice in criminal trials”, it should be used only in exceptional cases. It would be an abdication of the prosecution's duty if, out of an abundance of caution, it were simply “to dump all its unused material in the court's lap and leave it to the judge to sort through it regardless of its materiality to the issues present or potential”. Thus, the prosecution should put before the court only those documents which it regarded as material but wished to withhold. “Material” evidence was that which could, on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution, be seen to (i) be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case; (ii) raise or possibly raise a new issue the existence of which was not apparent from the evidence the prosecution proposed to use; or to (iii) hold out a real (as opposed to fanciful) prospect of providing a lead of evidence going to (i) or (ii). Exceptionally, in case of doubt about the materiality of the documents or evidence, the court might be asked to rule on the issue. In order to assist the prosecution in deciding whether evidence in its possession was “material”, and the judge in performing the balancing exercise, it was open to the defence to indicate any defence or issue which they proposed to raise. 27.In R. v. Rasheed (The Times, 20 May 1994), the Court of Appeal held that a failure by the prosecution to disclose the fact that a prosecution witness whose evidence was challenged had applied for or received a reward for giving information was a material irregularity which justifies overturning a conviction. 28.In R. v. Winston Brown ([1994] Criminal Appeal Reports p. 191), the Court of Appeal reviewed the operation of the Guidelines. It stated: “The Attorney General's objective was no doubt to improve the existing practice of disclosure by the Crown. That was a laudable objective. But the Attorney General was not trying to make law and it was certainly beyond his power to do so ... . The Guidelines are merely a set of instructions to Crown Prosecution Service lawyers and prosecuting counsel ... . Judged simply as a set of instructions to prosecutors, the Guidelines would be unobjectionable if they exactly matched the contours of the common law duty of non-disclosure ... . But if the Guidelines, judged by the standards of today, reduce the commons law duties of the Crown and thus abridge the common law rights of a defendant, they must be pro tanto unlawful ... . [T]oday, the Guidelines do not conform to the requirements of the law of disclosure in a number of critically important respects. First, the judgment in Ward established that it is for the court, not prosecuting counsel, to decide on disputed questions as to discloseable materials, and on any asserted legal ground to withhold production of relevant material ... . For present purposes the point of supreme importance is that there is no hint in the Guidelines of the primacy of the court in deciding on issues of disclosure ... . Secondly, the guidelines are not an exhaustive statement of the Crown's common law duty of disclosure: R. v. Ward at 25 and 681D. To that extent too the Guidelines are out of date. Thirdly, the Guidelines were drafted before major developments in the field of public interest immunity. [I]n paragraph 6 the Guidelines are cast in the form of a prosecutor's discretion ... . Much of what is listed as 'sensitive material' is no doubt covered by public interest immunity. But not everything so listed is covered by public interest immunity ... .” 29.In the case of R. v. Turner ([1995] vol. 1 Weekly Law Reports p. 264), the Court of Appeal returned to the balancing exercise, stating inter alia: “Since R. v. Ward ... there has been an increasing tendency for defendants to seek disclosure of informants' names and roles, alleging that those details are essential to the defence. Defences that the accused has been set up, and allegations of duress, which used at one time to be rare, have multiplied. We wish to alert judges to the need to scrutinise applications for disclosure of details about informants with very great care. They will need to be astute to see that assertions of a need to know such details, because they are essential to the running of the defence, are justified. If they are not so justified, then the judge will need to adopt a robust approach in declining to order disclosure. Clearly, there is a distinction between cases in which the circumstances raise no reasonable possibility that information about the informant will bear upon the issues and cases where it will. Again, there will be cases where the informant is an informant and no more; other cases where he may have participated in the events constituting, surrounding, or following the crime. Even when the informant has participated, the judge will need to consider whether his role so impinges on an issue of interest to the defence, present or potential, as to make disclosure necessary ... It is sufficient for us to say that in this case we are satisfied that the information concerning the informant showed a participation in the events concerning this crime which, coupled with the way in which the defence was raised from the very first moment by the defendant when he said that he was being set up, gave rise to the need for the defence to be aware of the identity of the informant and his role in this matter. We, therefore, conclude that if one applies the principle which has been quoted from R. v. Keane ... to the facts of the present case, there could only be one answer to the question as to whether the details concerning this informer were so important to the issues of interest to the defence, present and potential, that the balance which the judge had to strike came down firmly in favour of disclosure.” 30.Subsequent to the applicant's trial, a new statutory scheme covering disclosure by the prosecution has come into force in England and Wales. Under the 1996 Act, the prosecution must make “primary disclosure” of all previously undisclosed evidence which, in the prosecutor's view, might undermine the case for the prosecution. The defendant must then give a defence statement to the prosecution and the court, setting out in general terms the nature of the defence and the matters on which the defence takes issue with the prosecution. The prosecution must then make a “secondary disclosure” of all previously undisclosed material “which might reasonably be expected to assist the accused's defence as disclosed by the defence statement”. Disclosure by the prosecution may be subject to challenge by the accused and review by the trial court. 31.The Interception of Communications Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) came into force on 10 April 1986 following the Court's judgment in Malone v. the United Kingdom (2 August 1984, Series A no. 82). Its objective, as outlined in the Home Office White Paper which preceded it, was to provide a clear statutory framework within which the interception of communications on public systems would be authorised and controlled in a manner commanding public confidence (Interception of Communications in the United Kingdom (February 1985) Her Majesty's Stationary Office, Cmnd. 9438). 32.By section 1 (1) of the 1985 Act, anyone who intentionally intercepts a communication in the course of its transmission by means of a public communications system is guilty of a criminal offence. Section 1 (2) and (3) provide four circumstances in which a person who intercepts communications in this way will not be guilty of the offence, for example, interception of a communication pursuant to a warrant lawfully issued by the Secretary of State under section 2 of the Act, where the Minister considers the interception necessary in the interests of national security, for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime, or in order to safeguard the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. The operation of the Act is overseen by a Tribunal and a Commissioner: see further the Halford v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 June 1997 (Reports1997III, §§ 21-35). 33.Section 6 of the 1985 Act contains a series of provisions designed to secure that the retention and circulation of any intercepted material is “limited to the minimum ... necessary” to achieve the section 2 purpose for which it was obtained, including a provision requiring the destruction of any such material as soon as its retention “is no longer necessary” for that purpose. Section 9 provides that no evidence shall be adduced by any party, in any proceedings before a court or tribunal, which tends to suggest either that an offence under section 1 of the 1985 Act has been committed by a public servant or that a warrant has been issued to such a person under section 2 of the 1985 Act. 34.In R. v. Preston ([1994] vol. 2 Appeal Cases p. 130), the House of Lords decided that the fact that material intercepted pursuant to section 2 of the 1985 Act had been destroyed did not amount to a material irregularity in criminal proceedings. The basis for the House of Lords' decision was that the purpose for which such an interception might be permitted was narrowly defined in section 2 of the 1985 Act; in particular, the purpose of “preventing and detecting serious crime” did not extend to amassing evidence with a view to prosecuting offenders. One of the consequences of this construction was that, in a case of interception authorised for “preventing and detecting serious crime”, section 6 of the Act would normally require the destruction of intercepted material at a stage well before the prosecution's duty to disclose relevant material could arise in criminal proceedings. Accordingly, if the Act were to operate, as Parliament had intended, to restrict retention and dissemination of intercepted material to the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of “preventing and detecting serious crime”, there was likely to be no intercepted material to disclose to the defence and its destruction could not be said to amount to a material irregularity. 35.Following the judgments of the Court in Chahal v. the United Kingdom (15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V) and Tinnelly v. the United Kingdom (10 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV) the United Kingdom has introduced legislation making provision for the appointment of a “special counsel” in certain cases involving national security. The provisions are contained in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 (“the 1997 Act”), and the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”). Under this legislation, where it is necessary on national security grounds for the relevant tribunal to sit in camera, in the absence of the affected individual and his or her legal representatives, the Attorney General may appoint a special counsel to represent the interests of the individual in the proceedings. The legislation provides that the special counsel is not however “responsible to the person whose interest he is appointed to represent”, thus ensuring that the special counsel is both entitled and obliged to keep confidential any information which cannot be disclosed. 36.For example, in the immigration context, the relevant Rules under the 1997 Act are contained in the Special Immigration Appeals Act Commission (Procedure) Rules 1998 (Statutory Instrument no. 1998/1881). Rule 3 provides that in exercising its functions, the Commission shall secure that information is not disclosed contrary to the interests of national security, the international relations of the United Kingdom, the detection and prevention of crime, or in any other circumstances where disclosure is likely to harm the public interest. Rule 7 relates to the special advocate established by section 6 of the 1997 Act. It provides, inter alia, “7.(4)The function of the special advocate is to represent the interest of the appellant by - (a)making submissions to the Commission in any proceedings from which the appellant or his representative are excluded; (b)cross-examining witnesses at any such proceedings; and (c)making written submissions to the Commission. (5)Except in accordance with paragraph (6) to (9) the special advocate may not communicate directly or indirectly with the appellant or his representative on any matter connected with proceedings before the Commission. (6)The special advocate may communicate with the appellant and his representative at any time before the Secretary of State make the material available to him. (7)At any time after the Secretary of State has made the material available under rule 10(3), the special advocate may seek directions from the Commission authorising him to seek information in connection with the proceedings from the appellant or his representative. (8)The Commission shall notify the Secretary of State of a request for direction under paragraph (7) and the Secretary of State must, within a period specified by the Commission, give the Commission notice of any objection which he has to the request for information being made or to the form in which it is proposed to be made. (9)Where the Secretary of State makes an objection under paragraph (8) rule 11 shall apply as appropriate. ... 10.(1)If the Secretary of State intends to oppose the appeal, he must, no later than 42 days after receiving a copy of the notice of appeal - (a)provide the Commission with a summary of the facts relating to the decision being appealed and the reasons for the decision; (b)inform the Commission of the grounds on which he opposes the appeal; and (c)provide the Commission with a statement of the evidence which he relies upon in support of those grounds. (2)Where the Secretary of State objects to material referred to in paragraph (1) above being disclosed to the appellant or his representative, he must also (a)state the reasons for the objection; and (b)if and to the extent it is possible to do so without disclosing information contrary to the public interest, provide a statement of that material in a form that can be shown to the appellant. (3)Where he makes an objection under paragraph (2), the Secretary of State must make available to the special advocate, as soon as it is practicable to do so, the material which he has provided to the Commission under paragraphs (1) and (2). 11.(1)Proceedings under this rule shall take place in the absence of the appellant and his representative. (2)The Commission shall decide whether to uphold the Secretary of State's objection. (3)Before doing so it shall invite the special advocate to make written representations. (4)After considering representations made under paragraph (3) the Commission may - (a)invite the special advocate to make oral representations; or (b)uphold the Secretary of State's objections without requiring further representations from the special advocate. (5)Where the Commission is minded to overrule the Secretary of State's objection, or to require him to provide material in different form from that in which he has provided it under rule 10(2)(b), the Commission must invite the Secretary of State and the special advocate to make oral representations. (6)Where - (a)the Commission overrules the Secretary of State's objection or requires him to provide material in different form from that in which he has provided it under rule 10(2)(b), and (b)the Secretary of State wishes to oppose the appeal, he shall not be required to disclose any material which was the subject of the unsuccessful objection if he chooses not to rely upon it in opposing the appeal.” 37.In the context of fair employment proceedings in Northern Ireland, the scheme under sections 90 to 92 of the 1998 Act and the relevant Rules is identical to the mechanism adopted under the 1997 Act (above). 38.In addition, the Government has recently placed before Parliament two Bills which make provision for the appointment of “special counsel” (operating under the same conditions) in other circumstances. The Electronic Communications Bill 1999 provides for the appointment of a “special representative” in proceedings before an Electronic Communications Tribunal to be established for the purpose of examining complaints relating to the interception and interpretation of electronic communications. In the context of criminal proceedings, the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Bill 1999 makes provision for the appointment by the court of a special counsel in any case in which a trial judge prohibits an unrepresented defendant from cross-examining in person the complainant in sexual offence.",2000,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS THE COURT
1.	HOLDS BY NINE VOTES TO EIGHT THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION;
"
53,001-58149,Grand Chamber,"8.Mr Slimane-Kaïd was formerly the chairman of two public limited companies Provex S.A. (“Provex”) and Servec S.A. (“Servec”), respectively engaged, in particular, in buying equipment for export and in industrial coachbuilding. On 26 January 1982 he had also formed with Mrs Reinhardt a private company called Urka S.A.R.L (“Urka”), whose registered office was at the latter’s home address and main activity the hire and sale of equipment of all types both in France and overseas. On 1 July 1982 Mr Slimane-Kaïd had replaced Mrs Reinhardt as manager of that company.>Under two commercial agreements the Iveco company was to sell industrial vehicles to Provex and deliver “cab chassis” on bailment, with Iveco being named as bailee, to coachbuilders designated by either Provex or Servec. It was stipulated that at the end of the bailment and on receipt of payment, Iveco would deliver to Provex and Servec the vehicle test certificates (feuilles des mines) of the vehicles concerned and the certificates of sale. 10.The description of the facts set out in this and the next paragraph is based on the documents from the domestic proceedings produced to the Court. On 28 April 1984 two hundred and eighty-seven vehicles belonging to Iveco were delivered on bailment to Servec’s premises. The periods of bailment were due to end on 5 June, 5 July, 5 August and 5 September 1984; on those dates Provex and Servec were to take up the purchase option on the vehicles and to obtain delivery of the test certificates for each vehicle and the certificates of sale specific to Iveco. At Iveco’s request, a bailiff inspected Servec’s premises and drew up an official report on 11 May 1984. A court-appointed expert carried out an inspection on 25 July 1984 and an interim attachment was made on 28August 1984. It was found on the first of those three dates that 155 vehicles were missing, on the second that 198 were missing and on the third that 211 were missing. Iveco obtained restitution of only 43 vehicles; the others had been registered and sold. 11.On 27 July 1984 an Iveco representative reported certain of these matters to the Versailles Regional Criminal Investigation Department (“RCID”). Inquiries were made by Detective Inspector Renaud. In a report of 24 September 1984 he said that the test certificates and certificates of sale of 116 Iveco vehicles that had been filed by Provex for registration purposes with the prefecture were forgeries; he went on to say that offences may have been committed under the companies acts and insolvency legislation in connection with Servec /Provex and to conclude that a judicial investigation was necessary. 12.On 25 September 1984 the Chartres public prosecutor made a written application for an investigation to be opened into offences by an unnamed person of misappropriation and procuring the issue of administrative documents by means of false information, certificates or statements. Mr Candau, the investigating judge, who was assigned to the case that day, sent instructions on 27 September 1984 to the head of the Versailles RCID to “... continue the investigation with a view to identifying the persons who committed the offences, their co-principals and accomplices...”. 13.On 2 October 1984 Mr Slimane-Kaïd was taken into police custody and questioned. On 4 October 1984 the Versailles RCID’s report was received, Mr Slimane-Kaïd was charged with misappropriation and procuring the issue of administrative documents by means of false information, certificates or statements, and remanded in custody (until 8January 1985, when the investigating judge ordered his release under judicial supervision). On the same day the investigating judge sent instructions to the Versailles RCID to pursue the investigation. 14.On 2 October 1984 the Chartres public prosecutor made a written application for an additional investigation to be opened into offences of forgery of private, commercial or banking documents by Mr Slimane-Kaïd, who was suspected of having falsified the relevant test certificates and certificates of sale. 15.On 12 October 1984 Iveco – which had joined the proceedings as a civil party claiming damages on 9 October – made oral submissions and a director of Provex was heard as a witness. On the same day and on 15October 1984 Mr Slimane-Kaïd’s lawyer wrote to the investigating judge enclosing documents for the file. Iveco’s lawyer did likewise on the latter date. 16.Mr Slimane-Kaïd was questioned on 15 and 16 October 1984 and an Iveco executive was heard on 17 October. On 22 October a confrontation was held between Mr Slimane-Kaïd and an Iveco executive and on 9November 1984 Mr Slimane-Kaïd was questioned again and charged with forgery of private, commercial or banking documents. 17.On 10 November 1984 Mr Slimane-Kaïd’s lawyer wrote to the investigating judge enclosing documents for the file. Iveco’s lawyer did likewise on 13 December 1984. 18.Since the investigators suspected Mr Slimane-Kaïd of further offences, a second preliminary inquiry was started on 3 October 1984 into his activities at Provex, Servec and Urka. 19.Between 9 October 1984 and 27 March 1985 the Versailles RCID carried out a number of searches and seizures at Mr Slimane-Kaïd’s home address and on the premises of Provex; but they also carried out searches and seizures on 16 October 1984 at Mrs Reinhardt’s home (the registered office of Urka) – while she was in custody – and on 18 October 1984 in a house rented by Urka. On 14 November 1984 Mrs Reinhardt was questioned by a police investigator. 20.On 2 November 1984 the investigating judge had made an order transmitting the file to the public prosecutor for submissions (ordonnance de soit-communiqué). On 11December 1984 the Chartres public prosecutor made an application for additional charges to be preferred against MrSlimane-Kaïd for misappropriating company assets, offences equivalent to negligent bankruptcy (for failure to declare within the statutory time-limit that the company was unable to meet its liabilities), fraudulent bankruptcy (for misappropriation of part of the company’s assets), false accounting and fraud. On 14 December 1984 Mr Slimane-Kaïd was charged with those offences. 21.On 19 December 1984 the investigating judge sent instructions to the head of the Versailles RCID to pursue the investigation into all the offences with which Mr Slimane-Kaïd had been charged. 22.Mr Slimane-Kaïd was questioned on 3 and 7 January 1985. 23.The Versailles RCID sent the investigating judge its report on 1February 1985 after carrying out the instructions. On the same day, Mr G., who had been held in custody since 30 January, was charged with forgery of private, commercial or banking documents and released under judicial supervision. He was suspected of issuing false invoices to Provex and Servec and supplying Mr Slimane-Kaïd with the means for committing a like offence. 24.On 1 February 1985 the investigating judge sent instructions to the Versailles RCID to pursue the investigation into the offences with which MrSlimane-Kaïd and Mr G. had been charged. The Versailles RCID sent in its report on 7 February. 25.Mrs Reinhardt was arrested on 6 February 1985; the next day, following an application by the Chartres public prosecutor for a further investigation to be opened, she was charged with aiding and abetting the misappropriation of company assets and of handling misappropriated company assets. She was suspected of having given Mr Slimane-Kaïd four blank cheques between July and December 1983 drawn on Urka’s bank account for a total of 1,735,000 French francs – which she had signed and which Mr Slimane-Kaïd was to make out and endorse – and of having benefited from monies fraudulently obtained from that company. 26.On 7 February 1985 the investigating judge sent instructions to the Versailles RCID to pursue the investigation into the offences with which MrSlimane-Kaïd, Mr G. and Mrs Reinhardt had been charged. 27.On 25 March 1985 Mr Slimane-Kaïd’s lawyer sent a letter to the investigating judge enclosing documents for the file. 28.On 31 May 1985 the Versailles RCID sent in its report pursuant to the investigating judge’s instructions of 7 February 1985. 29.Mr Slimane-Kaïd and Mr G. were questioned on 4 and 5 December 1985 respectively and Mrs Reinhardt – who had been summoned to appear before the investigating judge on 4December 1985, but had not done so – on 11 February 1986. 30.On 25 March 1986 the investigating judge made an order transmitting the file to the public prosecutor for submissions. 31.On 16 July 1986 Mr Slimane-Kaïd wrote to the investigating judge enclosing documents for the file. 32.In a further application of 21 July 1986 the Chartres public prosecutor requested the investigating judge to pursue the investigation into the offences with which Mr Slimane-Kaïd, Mr G. and Mrs Reinhardt had been charged and to interview Mr Slimane-Kaïd, Mr G. and the managing director of the VPL company. 33.On 25 September 1986, following a complaint lodged on 17 July 1986 by VPL (which joined the proceedings as a civil party claiming damages) against a person or persons unknown for misappropriation and forgery of commercial documents, the senior investigating judge at Chartres made an order transmitting the file to the public prosecutor for submissions. 34.On 29 September 1986 the Chartres public prosecutor applied for an investigation to be opened for misappropriation and forgery of commercial documents by a person or persons unknown. The investigation was to be conducted by Judge Candau. 35.On 7 January 1987 both investigations were assigned to a different judge, Judge Halphen. He heard VPL’s representative on 5 February 1987. 36.On 16 February and 18 March 1987 Mr Slimane-Kaïd and his lawyer wrote to the investigating judge enclosing documents for the file in connection with the first set of proceedings. 37.Mr Slimane-Kaïd was questioned on 11 June and 8 July 1987. 38.On 1 July VPL’s lawyer had sent documents to the investigating judge requested by the latter in a letter of 9 June 1987. 39.Mr Slimane-Kaïd’s lawyer wrote to the investigating judge on 10September 1987 regarding the hearing of witnesses and inquiries in the first investigation. On 22 September 1987 Iveco’s lawyer produced documents for the file. 40.Instructions were sent on 7 October 1987 to the Versailles RCID for inquiries to continue into the offences with which the three suspects had been charged. 41.On 28 October 1987 the investigating judge ordered that an expert’s report be commissioned on the signatures at the foot of the certificates of sale. The expert filed his report on 31 December 1987. It was served on Iveco on 29 April 1988. 42.On 11 April 1988 Mr Slimane-Kaïd wrote to the investigating judge informing him that he had changed lawyers. 43.On 25 April 1988 the Versailles RCID’s report pursuant to the instructions of 7 October 1987 was received. 44.On 5 May 1988 Mr Slimane-Kaïd wrote to the investigating judge informing him that he had changed lawyers. 45.On 25 May 1988 he was questioned and charged in connection with the second investigation with misappropriation and forging commercial documents. 46.On 16 June 1988 he wrote to the investigating judge informing him that he had changed lawyers. 47.On 29 June 1988 he again appeared before the investigating judge. 48.On 7 and 22 July and 26 September 1988 Mr Slimane-Kaïd or his lawyer wrote to the investigating judge in connection with additional inquiries and the production of documents for the file. 49.On 5 December 1988 a confrontation was held between Mr Slimane-Kaïd and the VPL representative. 50.On 26 and 29 December 1988, 12 and 30 January, 27 and 28February and 6 and 7 March 1989, Mr Slimane-Kaïd or his lawyer wrote to the investigating judge in connection with additional inquiries and the production of documents for the file. 51.On 16 March 1989, in connection with the first investigation concerning Mr Slimane-Kaïd, the investigating judge instructed the Chartres police superintendent to “inspect the Iveco vehicle registration file for the first six months of 1969 and the first six months of 1970” and “to seize and place official seals on the originals of the test certificates”. 52.On 20 March 1989 VPL’s lawyer wrote to the investigating judge and produced documents for the file. 53.On 30 March 1989 the investigating judge heard an Iveco representative. Documents were produced for the file. 54.On 13 April 1989 the Versailles RCID’s report on the instructions of 16 March 1989 was sent to the investigating judge. 55.On 5 June 1989 Mr Slimane-Kaïd’s lawyer wrote to the investigating judge enclosing documents for the file relating to the first investigation; a lawyer acting for one of the civil parties did likewise on 16 June 1989. 56.On 26 June 1989 the investigating judge heard Mr Slimane-Kaïd, who both at that hearing and under cover of a letter of 7 July 1989 produced documents for the file. 57.On 25 July 1989 Mr Slimane-Kaïd requested an expert audit of Iveco’s accounts. The request was renewed by his lawyer on 26 July, but turned down by the investigating judge on 28 July 1989. MrSlimane-Kaïd appealed against that decision on 1 August 1989 but, following submissions on 19 September 1989 by the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Versailles Court of Appeal, the President of the Indictment Division of that court refused, in an order of 26 September 1989, to refer the request to the Indictment Division. 58.On 9 August 1989 Iveco’s lawyer had written to the investigating judge and produced documents for the file. Mr Slimane-Kaïd’s lawyer did likewise on 19 September 1989 in connection with the second investigation. 59.By an order of the president of the Chartres tribunal de grande instance on 23 October 1989, Judge Halphen was replaced by JudgeDefarge. On 3 November Judge Defarge ordered the transmission of the file to the public prosecutor for submissions with a view to joinder of the two sets of proceedings; the public prosecutor sought an order to that effect the same day. On 6 November 1989 the investigating judge made two orders: the first for joinder of the two sets of proceedings and the second for transmission of the file to the public prosecutor. On 28 November 1989 the public prosecutor made final submissions requesting the committal of MrSlimane-Kaïd, Mr G. and Mrs Reinhardt to the criminal court. On 14December 1989 Judge Defarge made a committal order. 60.The Chartres Criminal Court held a hearing on 11 June 1990. On 25 June 1990 Mr Slimane-Kaïd’s lawyer wrote to the president of that court enclosing documents for the file, as did Iveco’s lawyer on 8August 1990. Mr Slimane-Kaïd’s lawyer forwarded further documents on 25August. On 12 September 1990 the criminal court decided to extend its deliberations until 14 November1990. On 22 and 25 October 1990 respectively Iveco and Mr Slimane-Kaïd’s lawyers wrote to the president of that court enclosing documents for the file. 61.Judgment was delivered on 14 November 1990. Mr Slimane-Kaïd was found guilty of misappropriation, forging private, commercial or banking documents, fraud, false accounting and misappropriation of company assets and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, three of which were suspended; he was barred from carrying on any business activity for ten years. Mr G. was given a sentence of eighteen months’ imprisonment for forging private, commercial or banking documents and aiding and abetting the forgery of commercial documents and Mrs Reinhardt a one-year suspended sentence for aiding and abetting the misappropriation of company assets. The court declared the civil party claims of Iveco and VPL inadmissible. 62.Mr Slimane-Kaïd appealed to the Versailles Court of Appeal on 14November 1990, as did the public prosecutor's office, Mrs Reinhardt, MrG. and Iveco on 15, 16, 20 and 26 November 1990 respectively. 63.According to the Government, on 22 January and 8 February 1991 a summons was issued requiring a representative of VPL to appear, but the company could not be located. Mrs Reinhardt, Iveco, the liquidator of Servec (Mr Pierrat) and Mr Slimane-Kaïd were summonsed on 8, 15 and 19February and 8 March 1991 respectively. 64.At the hearing on 21 March 1991 Mrs Reinhardt, Mr Slimane-Kaïd and Iveco lodged their submissions. The hearing was adjourned to 3October 1991 to enable summonses to be served on Mr G. and VPL. Summonses were issued against Mr G. on 16 April 1991 and, according to the Government, against VPL on 25 September 1991, but neither could be located. 65.On 3 October 1991 the hearing was adjourned for the last time to 6February 1992 to enable summonses to be served on VPL and MrMariani, the liquidator acting in the joint liquidation of Provex, Provex S.A.R.L. and Urka. Summonses were issued against VPL on 5 November 1991 and 8January 1992. 66.On 2 April 1992 the Versailles Court of Appeal acquitted MrSlimane-Kaïd on the count of misappropriation of company assets, upheld the guilty verdict on the other counts and confirmed the sentence. It increased Mrs Reinhardt’s sentence to a term of eighteen months’ imprisonment, suspended, and reduced Mr G.’s sentence to one year. It upheld the judgment of the trial court in all other respects. 67.Mrs Reinhardt and Mr G. lodged appeals on points of law with the Court of Cassation that same day. Mr Slimane-Kaïd and Iveco did likewise on 3 and 6 April. Mr G. also appealed. The case file was sent to the Court of Cassation on 29 April 1992 and assigned to a reporting judge on 2 June 1992. Iveco lodged written pleadings on 31 August 1992, followed by MrG. and Mrs Reinhardt on 1 September 1992. On 12 October 1992 Iveco lodged one, and Mr Slimane-Kaïd two, written pleadings. The reporting judge filed his report on 20 November 1992 and the advocate-general was appointed on 30 November. Mr Slimane-Kaïd filed written pleadings on 18 February and 9March 1993. VPL and Mr Mariani filed pleadings on 11 March 1993. 68.According to the Government, it is unlikely that the advocate-general prepared his submissions in writing as he intended to present them orally at the hearing. The Government further maintained that at the hearing of the Court of Cassation on 15 March 1993, which took place without the applicant’s representatives being present, the reporting judge addressed the court and oral submissions were made by the advocate-general. 69.In a decision delivered on 15 March 1993, the Court of Cassation, relying on the reporting judge’s report, the parties’ pleadings and the submissions of the advocate-general, dismissed the appeals of those who had been convicted. 70.The Court of Cassation is composed of the president, the divisional presidents, the judges, the auxiliary judges, Principal State Counsel, the Principal Advocate-General, the advocates-general, the senior registrar and the divisional registrars (Article L. 121-1 of the Judicature Code). It is divided into five civil divisions and one criminal division, each comprising a divisional president, judges, auxiliary judges, one or more advocates-general and a divisional registrar (Articles L. 121-3, R. 121-3 and R. 121-4). The divisions are subdivided into sections, in which formation most appeals are heard. 71.Judgments of an Indictment Division and judgments delivered by an assize court, a criminal court or a police court sitting as a court of last instance may, if they are not in accordance with the law, be set aside on an appeal on points of law by either the public prosecutor's office attached to the court which delivered the judgment or the party adversely affected (Article 567 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). In criminal cases, Principal State Counsel at the Court of Cassation may appeal to that court only for the purposes of clarifying the law (pourvoi dans l’intérêt de la loi). In such cases, he appeals either on formal instructions from the Minister of Justice (Article 620) or of his own motion against a judgment delivered by an assize court, a criminal court or a police court sitting as a court of last instance where none of the parties has entered an appeal within the set time-limit (Article 621); in the event of an appeal by Principal State Counsel of his own motion, if the appeal is allowed the judgment is reversed but the parties may not rely on the Court of Cassation’s ruling to contest execution of the judgment that has been set aside (ibid.). 72.As soon as the case file is received by the registry of the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation, the president of that division appoints a reporting judge (Article 587 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) from among the judges and the auxiliary judges; the latter have a vote at deliberations on appeals in which they are appointed as reporting judge (ArticleL. 131-7 of the Judicature Code). 73.The reporting judge draws up a written report in which he carries out a thorough review of the case, sets out the legal arguments deduced from the grounds of appeal, indicates what research he has carried out into legal opinion and case-law on the basis of the grounds of appeal and states his recommendations. He also prepares a draft judgment, which is distributed to each of his colleagues as a basis for discussion at deliberations. The case file lodged by the reporting judge is sent by the registry, with the report and draft judgment, to the advocate-general assigned to the case by Principal State Counsel. Counsel for the parties are informed of the recommendation in the report (appeal to be declared inadmissible, or to be dismissed, allowed in part or in full) by an entry in the list of cases that is distributed a week before the hearing to lawyers practising in the Conseil d’Etat and Court of Cassation. In principle, any additional pleading filed at this stage will be declared inadmissible (Article 590 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). However, the Court of Cassation has a discretion and it appears that examples of its declaring inadmissible pleadings filed late are rare (see Y.Monnet, Principal Advocate-General at the Court of Cassation, “Pourvoi en cassation”, Juris-classeur procédure pénale, 1993, fascicule 40). 74.Principal State Counsel's Office at the Court of Cassation does not act as a prosecuting authority before that court. Except in appeals made for the purposes of clarifying the law, it acts only as a party joined to the criminal proceedings. Its role is not to argue the prosecution’s case but to ensure that the law is correctly applied (see “Pourvoi en cassation”, cited above, and P. Malibert, Ministère Public, Juris-classeur procédure pénale, 1994). Mr Charbonnier, Advocate-General at the Court of Cassation, thus explains that whereas the role of the prosecution consists, in principle, of law enforcement and upholding the law, the role of Principal State Counsel's Office at the Court of Cassation is confined to the latter task. In that capacity it is required to ensure that the law is correctly applied when it is clear and correctly construed when ambiguous (L. Charbonnier, “Ministère Public et Cour suprême”, La semaine juridique, Doctrine (1991), Ed. G. no.43). 75.The duties of State Counsel in the Court of Cassation are “personally conferred on Principal State Counsel” (Article R. 132-1 of the Judicature Code). Save for directions to lodge an appeal for the purposes of clarification of the law, Principal State Counsel does not receive any instructions regarding the performance of his duties (see for example the speech made on 6 January 1995 by Mr Jéol, Principal Advocate-General at the Court of Cassation, at the formal ceremony marking the beginning of the judicial year, La documentation française, Paris 1995, and the “Ministère Public et Cour suprême” article cited above). Principal State Counsel “assigns the Principal Advocate-General and the advocates-general to the divisions in which he considers they may most usefully serve” (Article R. 132-2). The Principal Advocate-General and the advocates-general “speak on behalf of Principal State Counsel in the divisions to which they have been appointed” (Article L. 132-3). In important cases their submissions are communicated to Principal State Counsel, who, if he is not in agreement and the advocate-general refuses to amend them, may delegate another advocate-general or make submissions himself at the hearing (Article R. 132-3). It appears, however, that that provision has never been applied and that in practice the advocates-general are, therefore, free to decide on the tenor of their submissions (see the “Pourvoi en cassation” article cited above). In his speech of 6 January 1995 (referred to above) Mr Jéol explained: “[the] value of the work [of the advocate-general], which is performed after the reporting judge has completed his task, is as a ‘second opinion’. Either the advocate-general agrees with the report, in which eventuality the decision to be taken will be clearer, or he disagrees, and will have triggered the necessary debate. In all cases his role is somewhat ‘maieutic’.” 76.The advocate-general’s submissions do not have to be in writing. 77.The list of hearings is fixed weekly. A single advocate-general deals with all cases on the list for the week he is on duty. He informs the relevant lawyers practising in the Conseil d’Etat and Court of Cassation, who, if they wish to make oral submissions, must advise the president before the hearing. 78.A few days before the hearing a preparatory “meeting” is held between the president and the senior judge of the division and the advocate-general on duty for that week; they systematically review the cases on the list and exchange views (see the “Pourvoi en cassation” and “Ministère Public et Cour suprême” articles cited above and the speech given on 10January 1997 by Mr Burgelin, Principal State Counsel at the Court of Cassation, entitled “L’avocat général à la Cour de cassation et la Convention européenne de sauvegarde des Droits de l’Homme”, Gazette du palais, 2324 May 1997). It appears to be customary after the meeting for the advocate-general to inform the lawyers acting in the case of the tenor of his submissions (see the speech entitled “L’avocat général à la Cour de cassation et la Convention européenne de sauvegarde des Droits de l’Homme” cited above). In parallel, the reporting judge’s report is studied in detail by the offices of the president and the senior judge, which give a reasoned opinion in writing. Their opinion, together with the submissions of the advocate-general, are communicated to the reporting judge a few days before the hearing (see the “Pourvoi en cassation” article cited above). 79.Hearings of the Criminal Division are held in public and the procedure is the same as that in the other courts (Article 601 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The procedure before the Court of Cassation is nevertheless in written form; the parties’ lawyers are not required to appear at hearings. In the Criminal Division there is an oral hearing only in the (rare) cases where the parties’ lawyers have expressly requested one. At the hearing the reporting judge is the first to address the court. He reads out his report but does not disclose his recommendations. If there are to be oral submissions, counsel for the appellant addresses the court first followed by counsel for the respondent; they may not submit any new legal argument. The advocate-general is the last to address the court; he makes submissions that are confined to legal issues and may concern the consideration of a ground of appeal raised by the court of its own motion (Article 602 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; and see the “Pourvoi en cassation” article cited above). It would appear that where oral submissions are made it is customary to allow the parties to reply to the advocate-general’s submissions, either orally or by a note addressed to the court in deliberations (see the speeches of Mr Jéol and Mr Burgelin referred to above). 80.After the public hearing, the members of the court deliberate in private. The reporting judge gives his opinion; the other judges and the president then express their views. Following a vote on whether the recommendations of the report should be adopted, the draft judgment, which each judge will have received eight days beforehand, is then considered (Article 603 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; and see also the “Pourvoi en cassation” article cited above). The advocate-general generally attends the deliberations. In that connection, Mr Burgelin explained in his speech of 10 January 1997 (cited above): “... practice on this point is settled. If it is an important case that has (exceptionally) been pleaded by counsel, the advocate-general leaves the courtroom at the same time as the parties and the public in order clearly to demonstrate that the judges deliberate alone. In ordinary cases, the advocate-general usually remains in his seat but does not take part in the debate. His presence results from purely practical considerations relating to the number of cases, which is often substantial, to be heard at each sitting. It has no special signification” (see also Mr Jéol’s speech referred to above). 81.The judgment in its adopted form is then finalised and delivered at a public hearing, in most cases immediately after the deliberations.",1998,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

81,001-70662,Grand Chamber,"9.The applicant was born in 1938 and currently lives in Lancashire. 10.In 1953 he joined the British army at 15 years of age. He served with the Royal Engineers between February 1954 and April 1968, when he was discharged for reasons unrelated to the present application. In 1981 he was diagnosed as suffering from hypertension and late onset bronchial asthma and in 1989 he was found to have high blood pressure and chronic obstructive airways disease (bronchitis – COAD). He has not worked since 1992 or thereabouts and is registered as an invalid. 11.The Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment at Porton Down (“Porton Down”) was established during the First World War in order to conduct research into chemical weapons with a view to advancing the protection of the United Kingdom's armed forces against such weapons. The research included tests of gases on humans as well as on animals. Servicemen who participated in the tests were paid extra wages. 12.The applicant participated in such tests at Porton Down. While there was some debate as to whether he attended in 1962, it was not disputed that he did so in July 1963. His service medical records contained no record of any tests at Porton Down. 13.The applicant alleged as follows. In the spring of 1962 he was invited to Porton Down; he was medically examined on arrival; he was asked on three or four occasions to enter a sealed and unventilated room, where he was seated and strapped to a chair; over a period of about six hours, drops of mustard gas were applied to patches of tissue which were then taped to his skin; he was told that, if he was unlucky, he might suffer temporary pain or discomfort but otherwise he was not given any, or any proper, warning about the possible consequences of the tests for his health; once the tests were finished he returned to his unit; there was no further medical examination after he left Porton Down. He relied on a memorandum and file note of 13 November 1989 (see paragraph 24 below) and on the conclusions in this respect of 14 January 2004 of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal (“the PAT” – see paragraph 63 below) to substantiate his participation in tests in 1962. 14.While the Government did not deny that participation, they pointed to a number of matters that appeared to militate against such a conclusion: the summary and alphabetical record books did not refer to his attendance in 1962 but only to his attendance in 1963; there was no documentary evidence at all of the 1962 tests whereas certain records existed of his 1963 tests; and if the PAT had accepted his participation in the 1962 tests, this was based solely on his recollections. 15.The nerve gas (known as “G-agent” or “GF”) test is described in the relevant records as “exposure to single-breath GF”. The applicant alleged that he was told before the test that the experiment “could not harm a mouse”; that he was placed in an air-tight, glass-partitioned cubicle containing a face mask, the mask was placed over his mouth and nose, the fitting was checked and the chamber was sealed; that a loudspeaker informed him that the test was about to begin and to inhale normally; that he felt an immediate tightening of the chest muscles and lungs which wore off after the end of the test; and that blood samples were taken at regular intervals during the following twenty-four hours. The Government submitted that diluted GF vapours were put into a gas chamber and, as the name of the test suggested, volunteers took a single breath of air with calculated doses of GF gas through a tube connected to that chamber, they held their breath for two seconds and then exhaled. 16.The other test involved mustard gas and was described in the records as “H sensitivity and penetration”. According to the applicant, it followed the same format as that in 1962. The Government added the following detail: the mustard gas test was designed to test the performance of protective clothing and was carried out in two parts. The first was a sensitivity test to determine an individual's sensitivity to mustard gas and it involved the placement of a dilute solution of the gas on the participant's upper arm. If after twenty-four hours the test subject had a small red mark, he or she was deemed too sensitive and did not participate any further in the tests. On the other hand, if the participant was not demonstrably sensitive, the second part consisted of putting a drop of dilute mustard gas solution on three samples of protective clothing left in place on the participant's body and the skin under the clothing was examined after six and then twenty-four hours. The participants were monitored before and after the tests. The rooms were properly ventilated, the dosages were small and safe and the tests were carefully planned and controlled. 17.From 1981 the applicant was medically treated for breathlessness and high blood pressure and by 1987 these problems had significantly worsened. He began to search for his Porton Down records through what he described as “medical” and “political” channels. 18.In response to his doctor's enquiry, in late 1987 the Ministry of Defence (MOD) supplied his doctor with his service medical records on a “medical in confidence” basis. Those records did not refer to the applicant's Porton Down tests. 19.In a letter of 14 November 1989, Porton Down responded to another enquiry from his doctor. The letter was sent on a “medical in confidence” basis and confirmed the applicant's participation in a GF gas test in July 1963. That GF test had been preceded and succeeded by a full medical examination which revealed no abnormality. The letter also referred (inaccurately, as it later emerged – see paragraph 36 below) to seven blood tests conducted after the GF test and to their results and confirmed that “peak flow meter measurements” had also been taken from the applicant and that “breath-holding tests”, a clothing penetration study (apparently, although not expressly noted, the mustard gas tests) and a battery of personality tests were performed. The results of these tests were not included in the letter and no other records supporting the statements made in the letter were enclosed. His doctor's stamp on it indicates that he decided to tell the applicant that all was normal. The applicant persuaded his doctor to show him the letter in 1994. 20.By a letter dated 14 December 1989, a consultant informed the applicant's doctor that he doubted that the applicant's bronchial asthma was caused by his exposure to nerve gas. Further tests were to be carried out. 21.A letter from Dr H. (a professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds and later the court-appointed expert witness in the PAT proceedings – see paragraphs 42-68 below) dated 5 December 1994 to the applicant stated that full and detailed records were required to judge the long-term effects of his participation in the tests and that a long-term epidemiological study would have been useful either to establish that there were long-term effects or to reassure test participants that there were none. His letter of 10 July 1996 repeated his view as to the need for such a study. 22.An internal Porton Down memorandum of 24 November 1997 noted that certain blood-test figures given in the letter to the applicant's doctor of 14 November 1989 were inaccurate. In addition, it was considered that the applicant's description of the tests was roughly consistent with the procedures in the 1960s. While there were no obvious gaps in the 1960s records, it could not be said that the records were complete: the applicant could have attended in 1962 and his name could have been omitted or incorrectly recorded due to a clerical error. 23.Inter alia, the applicant carried out a sit-in hunger strike at Porton Down, held a press conference in the House of Commons and requested members of parliament to put parliamentary questions. 24.Between 11 and 14 November 1989, the applicant went on hunger strike outside Porton Down. On 13 November 1989 he spoke with the Secretary of Porton Down. The latter noted in a memorandum of that date that the applicant's description of the tests was strong enough to indicate that he had been there and he recommended a further search of the records. He also recorded in a file note (of the same date) that the applicant's description of his visits to Porton Down in 1962 and 1963 left him with a level of confidence that he had been a volunteer there on both occasions. This led to the letter of 14 November 1989 to the applicant's doctor (see paragraph 19 above). 25.In January 1994 the applicant formed the Porton Down Volunteers Association with the object of seeking recognition and redress for test participants. The association has over 300 members to date. 26.By a letter dated 26 January 1994, the Chief Executive of Porton Down answered, at the request of the Secretary of State for Defence, a series of questions raised by a member of parliament about chemical and biological warfare testing. The Chief Executive's letter described the test procedure, stating that participants were given a medical examination before and after the tests and recalled for check-ups “from time to time”. It was pointed out that there was no evidence that the health of participants had deteriorated because of their test participation. On 22 June 1994 the Chief Executive confirmed the well-established policy of the MOD of releasing service medical records to a veteran's doctor on a “medical in confidence” basis. The Chief Executive's letter of 7 March 1995 (in response to a parliamentary question to the Minister of State for Defence) noted that the tests did not include any plan for long-term systematic monitoring of participants: any monitoring thereafter was purely ad hoc and sporadic. 27.On 2 February 1994 the applicant wrote to the MOD requesting copies of his medical records and of reports on the relevant tests. The reply of 9 March 1994 from Porton Down recalled the MOD policy of release on a “medical in confidence” basis. The applicant's doctor had been provided with information in 1989 on this basis. It was “entirely up to your own doctor how much or how little of this information he conveys to you”. Further queries from the applicant led to a similar response from Porton Down by letter dated 20 April 1994. 28.On 12 December 1994 Lord Henley stated in the House of Lords that the MOD would continue to send veterans to their doctors and would release medical records as appropriate. Information was provided to doctors to allow proper diagnosis and “would be released, if necessary”. He repeated that there was no evidence over the previous forty years that test participants had suffered harm to their health. 29.In response to a series of parliamentary questions put to the Secretary of State for Defence as to the necessity for a public inquiry, the government's representative replied on 28 February 1995 that there was no evidence that any test participants had suffered any long-term damage to their health in the past four decades. Similar responses as to the lack of evidence of harm to the test participants were given by the Minister of State for Defence in Parliament on 4 April and 2 May 1995 in response to questions concerning the instigation of a study into the long-term health effects of exposure to chemical and biological substances. 30.On 25 April 1995 the applicant and the Labour Party defence spokesman took part in a press conference on the question of Porton Down volunteers and their requirements. 31.Following a meeting between them, on 2 December 1997 the Minister of State for Defence wrote to the applicant. He referred to the concerns of the applicant (and other test participants) that information about the tests was being withheld. He confirmed that this was not the case but rather reflected “less than thorough” record-keeping than would be currently expected. Henceforth all volunteers would be able to obtain access to all the information held on them at Porton Down and steps would be taken to declassify reports so as to make that information more accessible. Certain copies of test documents were enclosed: (a) the alphabetical record book which recorded the applicant's attendance at Porton Down between 13 and 19 July 1963; (b) the summary record book which referred to the two tests carried out on the applicant involving GF and mustard gas and listed the monitoring procedures that were to be carried out on the applicant (chest X-rays, peak flow meter tests, “x 3 x alcohol” quiz, breath-holding tests and blood tests); and (c) a report entitled “Effects of Inhaled GF on Man” which described the single breath GF test and contained an analysis of the results of the tests carried out on fifty-six participants, believed to include the applicant's test. It was indicated that these documents were available to any test participant who requested them. This was the first material obtained by the applicant about his participation in the tests. The letter went on to note that much GF-related research work had already been published in open literature or was in the Public Record Office. The review of files to be disclosed would continue and the applicant was given a list of all relevant research papers already published between 1957 and 1987. There was no evidence to date to suggest that any volunteer had suffered long-term adverse effects. A full independent and long-term study of the health impacts of test participation was not, however, considered feasible or practical so none had been or would be carried out. 32.In a letter dated 31 August 1999 to the PAT, Porton Down indicated that it was well acquainted with the applicant, having received numerous communications from him and from members of parliament. 33.By a letter dated 3 May 2001, Porton Down informed the applicant that it had discovered some old laboratory notebooks that included information about the 1963 tests: one book included some previously unavailable details of the mustard patch tests. A pre-exposure chest X-ray and the associated report card were also now available. The applicant was to contact Porton Down if he wanted to see this material or obtain copies. 34.As well as those disclosed with the Minister of State's letter of 2December 1997, the following documents were also submitted to the Court. 35.The Government indicated that these were all the relevant records that could be traced: (a) an extract from a laboratory record of results of personality and intelligence tests; (b) extracts from laboratory records of GF blood tests – seven blood samples were taken from the applicant; and (c) an explanation of the GF blood-test results. 36.The Government corrected their previous explanations of the seven blood samples (see paragraph 19 above): one was taken on 13 July 1963, a second one prior to the applicant's exposure to GF and the remaining five were taken later. They also corrected other errors relating to information provided in their earlier observations about those tests including the following: “the reference to '25 milligrams of GF [vapour per kilogram of body weight]' appears to have been a typographical error. In fact, calculated doses of GF ranged from 0.16 to 2.84 microgrammes per kilogramme of body weight.” They also disclosed documents recently discovered following a further search: (a) the applicant's pre-exposure X-ray and its associated report card (see paragraph 33 above); (b) a report dated August 1942 which described the manner in which the sensitivity tests to mustard gas were performed and entitled “Technique of the Physiological Experiments Carried Out on the Human Subjects at [Porton Down]”; and (c) extracts from a laboratory notebook entitled “Overgarment Tests. Mustard on Men”, relating to mid-July 1963 and referring to the applicant. 37.On 10 June 1991 the applicant claimed a service pension on the grounds of “hypertension/breathing problems” resulting from the Porton Down tests (and, in addition, from his radiation exposure on Christmas Island during the relevant nuclear tests there). The Department of Social Security (DSS) obtained copies of his service and civilian medical records together with a report from his doctor, which confirmed that he suffered from hypertension, COAD and late onset bronchial asthma. On 28January 1992 the Secretary of State rejected his claim for a service pension as there was no causal link demonstrated between the tests and those medical conditions. The applicant did not pursue an appeal at that stage. 38.The applicant consulted solicitors in 1994 and obtained legal aid for proceedings. By a letter dated 14 November 1994 to the Secretary of State, his solicitors threatened proceedings, alleging, inter alia, negligence, assault and breach of statutory duty on the part of the MOD, and demanding the release of all medical and laboratory records in the possession of the Secretary of State or of Porton Down as regards the test periods in 1962 and 1963, failing which the applicant would apply to the High Court for pre-action discovery. The applicant's representatives met with MOD representatives in early January 1995 on a “without prejudice” basis and by a letter dated 5 June 1995 requested confirmation from the MOD as to whether a certificate would be issued under section 10 of the 1947 Act (“a section 10 certificate”). 39.By a letter dated 4 July 1995 to the applicant's solicitors, the claims section of the MOD wrote as follows: “War Pensions Agency has informed me that a section 10 certificate in respect of acute bronchitis (1963), a bruised knee and loss of hearing will be regarded as attributable to service and a section 10 certificate will be issued. The other ailments for which [the applicant] claimed a war pension have not been regarded as attributable to service.” 40.On 3 August 1995 a section 10 certificate was signed by the Secretary of State: “In so far as the personal injury of [the applicant] is due to anything suffered as a result of his service in the Army between 16 February 1954 and 2 April 1968, I hereby certify that his suffering that thing has been treated as attributable to service for the purpose of entitlement to an award under the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983, which relates to disablement or death of members of the Army.” 41.By a letter dated 8 August 1995, the Treasury Solicitor provided a copy of the section 10 certificate to the applicant's representatives. 42.Following the judgment of this Court in McGinley and Egan v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III) and the Government's disclosure of certain documents in their observations in the present case (on 9 March 1998), the applicant requested an adjournment of the present application in order to pursue an appeal to the PAT and, in particular, disclosure of documents under Rule 6 of the Pensions Appeal Tribunals (England and Wales) Rules 1980 (“the PAT Rules”). The present application was adjourned. 43.On 1 June 1998 he lodged his PAT appeal. Since the War Pensions Agency (“the WPA” – a specialised agency of the Department of Social Security) clarified that a further form was required, on 8 November 1998 the applicant re-lodged the appeal. 44.In February 1999 the applicant received his “Statement of Case”. He obtained two extensions of the time-limit for the submission of his “answer” to the Statement of Case (to take advice from an expert chemical pathologist on the documents already disclosed and on those which were also to be requested during the PAT appeal and to consider the intervening observations of the Government in the present application) and he indicated that he would be making an application under Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules. 45.On 30 July 1999 his answer was submitted to the WPA along with a letter which noted that the answer included an application for disclosure of documents under Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules: paragraph 18 of the answer set out a list of seventeen categories of document required by him under that rule. 46.On 10 August 1999 the WPA responded by pointing out that enquiries were being made to obtain all the information requested under Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules. Once received, the WPA would ask for the agreement of the President of the PAT to disclose it. 47.On the same day the WPA wrote to Porton Down enclosing a copy of the applicant's Rule 6 request and asking for the information as soon as possible so that the agreement of the President of the PAT could be obtained. 48.On 14 March and 13 April 2000 the WPA sent the supplementary Statement of Case (now incorporating the supplemental medical evidence) to the applicant and to the PAT, respectively. 49.On 3 August 2000 the President of the PAT responded to the applicant's enquiry, indicating that his case had not been listed as it awaited production of further documentary evidence and the Secretary of State's response. However, since the Rule 6 request should not have been made in the applicant's answer to the Statement of Case, that request had just come to light. The applicant was to confirm to the President if he intended paragraph 18 of his answer to constitute his Rule 6 request and, if so, the President would be grateful to receive any observations that would assist his consideration of the relevance of the documents to the appeal issues. The applicant was also to identify the State department to which a Rule 6 direction should be addressed. 50.On 9 November 2000 the applicant confirmed to the President of the PAT that paragraph 18 of his answer did indeed constitute his Rule 6 request and he made detailed submissions on the matters requested by the President. 51.By a letter dated 13 November 2000, the President of the PAT requested the applicant to submit a draft direction and attend a hearing on it since he was concerned that the wording of some parts of the Rule 6 request appeared to be ambiguous and lacking in clarity. The applicant submitted a draft direction (essentially listing those documents already included in paragraph 18 of his answer). 52.By an order dated 1 February 2001, the President of the PAT directed, pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules, disclosure of the scheduled documents by the Secretary of State since the documents “were likely to be relevant to the issues to be determined in the appeal”. 53.On 6 July 2001 the Secretary of State responded to the direction of the President of the PAT. It was marked “medical in confidence”. It referred to the documents already submitted by the Government to this Court (see paragraphs 34-36 above). The Secretary of State was unable to give a definitive response to the request for the fifth category of document required (namely, “any scientific or medical reports, whether published or prepared for internal use by Porton Down, the [MOD] or other government departments or agencies of the volunteer studies or experiments in Porton Down between 1957 and 1968 which were similar or related to the studies or experiments in which [the applicant] was involved”). A full and careful review had been undertaken and was a time-consuming process. Many of the documents identified as being possibly relevant to the request were classified. The Secretary of State had asked for an urgent review of the classification to be undertaken and, once the review was completed, he would let the PAT have his full response. Otherwise the Secretary of State provided various explanations of the documents already submitted by the Government to this Court and details of the precise dates on which the applicant would have participated in the tests, of the levels of exposure to gases and of various headings and abbreviations in the disclosed documents. The only documents (additional to those already submitted to this Court) disclosed to the PAT were the applicant's service and payment records, the latter of which included a payment for attendance for a week at Porton Down in July 1963. 54.The MOD's letter was passed to the applicant on 25 July 2001. By a letter dated 19 July 2002, the applicant wrote to the PAT apologising for not having responded and explaining the reasons for the delay. 55.By a letter dated 23 August 2002, the MOD disclosed documents concerning the above-described fifth category: two reports entitled “The feasibility of performing follow-up studies of the health of volunteers attending [Porton Down]” and “The single-breath administration of Sarin”, from which individual names had been blanked out. The feasibility report acknowledged that the records held at Porton Down prior to the late 1970s generally consisted of the name, service number and age of participants at the date of testing but were not “sufficient to allow either a comprehensive morbidity study or mortality study to proceed”. While a study could be carried out on post-1976 test participants, “such a study would be of very limited value and may only serve to draw attention to [Porton Down's] interest in possible long-term health problems experienced by volunteers”. The feasibility report concluded that a comprehensive follow-up study of all volunteers was “impractical”. Porton Down's library catalogue had also mentioned a document entitled “Unique papers relating to early exposure of volunteers to GD [O-Pinacolyl methylphosphonoflouidate, commonly known as Soman] and GF and DM [diphenylaminearsine chloride, commonly known as Adamsite]”. However, a copy of this document could not be located. A letter of 20 August 2002 was also enclosed which certified that nine of the requested documents were “in the nature of departmental minutes or records” and would not therefore be disclosed (Rule 6(1) of the PAT Rules). 56.A hearing was fixed for 3 October 2002. On 27 September 2002 the applicant was obliged to request an adjournment since his counsel had advised that further questions needed to be put to Dr H. On 30 September 2002 the PAT declined to adjourn, indicating that it was unlikely Dr H. could or would prepare a report. 57.On 2 October 2002 the MOD wrote to the PAT and the applicant. While nine documents had been previously certified as non-disclosable, (letter of 23 August 2002 – see paragraph 55 above), seven of those nine documents could now be disclosed. The MOD had “had the opportunity of re-examining the documents ... with a view to assessing whether [they] could be the subject of voluntary disclosure ... in an effort to ensure that everything that can be disclosed has been disclosed and so as to ensure the maximum openness and the maximum assistance to the [PAT]”. Certain blocking out had been done on some disclosed documents to protect the identities of staff involved and to excise irrelevant material. Two documents could still not be disclosed: the first did not appear “to contain anything of relevance” to the applicant's tests and, in any event, “contained information which remains security sensitive and is not properly subject to voluntary disclosure on security grounds”; and the second required permission from the United States before it could be disclosed. 58.The appeal was scheduled for 3 October 2002. The applicant applied for an adjournment supported by the Veterans Agency (the successor of the WPA – “the VA”). The PAT decision (delivered on 7 October 2002) recorded as follows: “The [PAT] are deeply disturbed that this application has proved necessary as a result of the [applicant's] advisers' failure to consider documents disclosed over a year ago, in a timely fashion. However, since the [VA] also appear to be without documentation and there is confusion by the [applicant] as to whether he also wishes to appeal for hypertension, we have reluctantly decided to allow the adjournment. It is highly unsatisfactory that Court resources have been wasted in this way. To prevent this happening in the future the Tribunal intend to exercise some control over the ongoing progress of the appeal.” The PAT was to clarify with the MOD the status of certain classified documents and the extent to which they could be released to the public, and directed the MOD to provide, by 21 October 2002, disclosure of further documents. The MOD, the VA and the applicant were to notify the PAT by 18 November 2002 of the questions and documents it wanted Dr H. to examine. It was intended that the PAT would add its own questions and submit a composite questionnaire to Dr H. who would report in response to the PAT. The applicant was also to confirm his position as regards the hypertension appeal by 28 October 2002. 59.On 21 October 2002, the MOD disclosed to the PAT three declassified documents. These were forwarded by the PAT to the applicant by a letter dated 8 November 2002, accompanied by a warning that the MOD had released the documents for the purpose of the appeal and that no information in them was to be used for any other purpose without the consent of the MOD. By a letter dated 25 October 2002, the applicant confirmed that his appeal had been intended to cover hypertension also, he explained the reasons for his confusion and he requested an extension of time to so appeal. A hypertension appeal form was lodged with the PAT on 5 December 2002. 60.By a letter dated 3 December 2002, the PAT wrote to Dr H. enclosing the documents disclosed by the MOD (at that point) with two sets of questions (prepared by the applicant and the medical member of the PAT). By a letter dated 19 February 2003, Dr H. provided the PAT with a report. The applicant having noted that Dr H. had omitted to respond to the PAT questions, Dr H. did so in a supplemental report sent to the PAT under cover of a letter dated 14 May 2003. 61.In a document dated 14 October 2003, the MOD submitted its comments on Dr H.'s reports. On 16 October 2003 the VA submitted a supplementary Statement of Case. 62.The PAT appeal hearing took place on 23 October 2003. It allowed the hypertension appeal to be heard out of time but, once it became clear that the VA had not processed the appeal documentation filed by the applicant, the PAT reluctantly granted the MOD an adjournment to allow the VA time to “properly consider all the evidential material and prepare a reasoned medical opinion”. The COAD appeal was, however, dismissed. 63.On 14 January 2004 the PAT delivered its written decision. As to the facts, the PAT accepted that the applicant had undergone tests for mustard gas “some time in 1962 as well as the documented tests in July 1963” despite the fact that there was no reference in his service records or in other research records to the 1962 test. The PAT also found “disquieting” the “difficulties” experienced by the applicant in obtaining the records which were produced to the PAT. The PAT also established the following facts: “1.We find that [the applicant] suffered no long-term respiratory effect from skin contact with mustard gas following both tests in 1962 and 1963.>We find that [the applicant] was administered only small doses of mustard gas and GF gas which would have resulted in minimal exposure to mustard gas by off-gassing and a limited and transitory reaction to the GF gas. Although no records relating to doses exist, the mustard gas tests were designed to test the suitability of military clothing to exposure and were not a gas test per se. Furthermore, after a fatality at Porton Down in 1953, safeguards were put in place to ensure that volunteers were only exposed to safe dosages.>The compelling weight of the evidence is that [the applicant] did not receive, in any of the tests, dosages likely to have long-term effects as described in the research papers. In particular, the [PAT expert], although accepting the possibility that given further research through a long-term follow-up study a link might be found, concludes that there is no evidence to link [the applicant's] exposure to either gases with his present condition. We accept [the PAT expert's] conclusion that, given the limited doses and [the applicant's] minimal immediate reactions, this would rule out a link between the tests and the claimed conditions.>We particularly rely on [Dr H.'s] expert report. He has analysed the specific data relevant to [the applicant's] case and considered the conditions for which he is claiming in relation to that specific data. The research papers relied on by the [applicant], although of some evidential value, are very general and speculative. We therefore prefer the evidence, and the conclusions reached by [Dr H.] in his reports.” The PAT also accepted, as a matter of law, that it was sufficient to show that the proved service event was only one of the causes of the condition even if there were other contributory factors. However, it stated: “2.We do not accept that the lack of possible evidence of other follow-up tests is sufficient to constitute reliable evidence.>We find that there is some reliable evidence surrounding the Porton Down tests for which [the applicant] volunteered. However, this evidence tends, if anything, to support the view that there is in fact no link between those tests and [the applicant's] current conditions. The test of reasonable doubt is not therefore met.>There is no reliable evidence to suggest a causal link between the tests for either mustard gas or GF gas and the claimed condition.>[The PAT expert's] views that 'he cannot exclude the possibility' of a link between exposure to GF and/or mustard gas and the claimed condition, does not meet the 'reasonable doubt' test. Furthermore, he 'rules out' exposure to GF as a cause and deems it 'unlikely' that mustard gas is a cause.>Finally, [the applicant's counsel] invites us to allow the appeal for reasons which can be summarised as 'general fairness'. The [PAT] does not have legislative or discretionary power to do so. The decision of the [PAT] is to disallow the appeal for [COAD].” 64.On 4 February 2004 the applicant applied to the PAT for leave to appeal to the High Court (on the COAD matter) and for a stay of the hypertension appeal then pending before the PAT. On 26 April 2004 leave was refused, the PAT's reserved decision being delivered on 28 April 2004. 65.On 11 May 2004 the applicant applied for leave to appeal to the High Court. On 13 July 2004 leave was granted. 66.The applicant's appeal notice and supporting skeleton argument were submitted on 10 August 2004. The appeal was listed to be heard on 7October 2004. 67.On 8 October 2004 the High Court allowed the appeal and referred the matter back to the PAT for a further hearing. 68.On 7 March 2005 a directions hearing was held before the PAT. It ordered the hypertension and COAD appeals to be heard together and mutual disclosure of any further documents relevant to the appeal by 18April 2005. On the latter date the Treasury Solicitor produced a “schedule of disclosure” listing and disclosing eleven documents: apart from three items, the applicant had not seen them before. The Treasury Solicitor maintained that disclosure of most of the documents (including two sets of minutes of meetings which Rule 6 specifies can be withheld) was not obligatory as they were of marginal relevance, noted that all documents had been downgraded to “unclassified” and indicated that the MOD would endeavour to produce the annexes referred to in certain documents. 69.The armed forces have, since 1998, put in place a service to deal with enquiries from Porton Down test participants (“the 1998 Scheme”). The relevant information pamphlet noted that participants could request their test records, that a search would be carried out for references to that person and for additional evidence of actual procedures, that a summary would be provided and that, if the person wanted to go to Porton Down, he or she could obtain the actual records. While the pamphlet noted that reasonably comprehensive records had existed since 1942, individuals had to accept that old records in some cases were very sparse, that record keeping in years gone by was not up to current standards and that in certain cases a person's attendance might not even have been marked. The pamphlet claimed that no participant was worse off after the Porton Down tests. 70.In 2001 the Porton Down Volunteers Medical Assessment Programme was established by the MOD to investigate health concerns of Porton Down test participants. The study involved 111 participants but no control group. The report, published in April 2004, was entitled “Clinical Findings in 111 Ex-Porton Down Volunteers”. It noted that over 20,000 had participated in the tests since Porton Down's establishment in 1916 and that 3,000 had participated in nerve gas tests and 6,000 in mustard gas tests, with some servicemen having been exposed to both. It concluded that: “On a clinical basis, no evidence was found to support the hypothesis that participation in Porton Down trials produced any long-term adverse health effects or unusual patterns of disease compared to those of the general population of the same age.” 71.From July 2002 the MOD funded “an initial pilot research project” on mortality and cancer incidence among Porton Down test participants. It compared 500 participants with a control group of 500 other servicemen and the decision was taken that a full-scale epidemiological study should be undertaken. By mid-2003 this had begun and it was expected to take about two years to complete. 72.Further to the death of Aircraftsman Maddison in May 1953 after being exposed to Sarin gas (also referred to as GB gas, a nerve agent related to GF), a coroner's inquest was held and recorded “death by misadventure”. An application was brought for a fresh inquest alleging, inter alia, that incomplete evidence had been brought before the coroner and in November 2002 the Court of Appeal ordered a fresh inquest. It concluded on 15November 2004 with the jury finding that the cause of Mr Maddison's death was the “application of a nerve agent in a non-therapeutic experiment”. Judicial review proceedings appear to be pending. In or around 2004-05 a non-governmental organisation (“Porton Down Veterans”) discovered during searches in the Public Record Office two letters of May and August 1953 containing legal advice from the Treasury Solicitor to the MOD about Mr Maddison's case and about section 10 of the 1947 Act. That organisation sent this material to the Veterans Policy Unit – Legacy Health Issues of the MOD on 7 February 2005. The Treasury Solicitor's letter of August 1953 noted as follows: “When the case was referred to me previously I did consider the relevance of section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 but I came to the conclusion that it had no application. On the information before me I am still of that opinion. Subsection (1) of that section, which deals with injuries caused by acts of members of the Armed Forces, can have no application since the administration of the GB gas to ... Maddison was (so I understand) carried out by [civilian] personnel and not by any member of the Armed Forces. Subsection (2) also seems inapplicable. [It] provides that no proceedings in tort are to lie against the Crown for death or personal injury due to anything suffered by a member of the Armed Forces if that thing is suffered by him 'in consequence of the nature or condition of any equipment or supplies used for the purposes of the Armed Forces of the Crown'. As I understand the facts of this case, GB gas cannot be said to be a 'supply used for the purposes of the Armed Forces' at all, it being purely an experimental substance and one which has never been used for the purposes of the Armed Forces. If this is correct, then section 10 of the 1947 Act cannot protect the Crown or the Minister from liability.” 73.It was a well-established and unqualified common-law rule that the Crown was neither directly nor vicariously liable in tort. 74.The rule was counterbalanced in several ways. Actions against the errant serviceman would be permitted in which case the Crown would invariably (if the defendant was acting in the course of his duty) accept responsibility for any damages awarded. In cases where the individual author of the injury could not be identified, a nominee defendant would be appointed to enable the claim to proceed. In addition, from 1919 a serviceman injured in the course of war service was entitled to a disability pension and his spouse to a pension. The scope of these entitlements later widened to include disability or death caused by injury attributable to any service in the armed forces (war service or not). A feature of these successive schemes was that entitlement to a pension did not depend on proof of fault against the Crown. 75.Further to strong criticism of the Crown's position as litigant, in the 1920s legislation was envisaged that would make the Crown liable in tort. The 1924 terms of reference of the drafting committee were to prepare a bill to provide, inter alia, that the Crown should become liable to be sued in tort. Clause 11 of the draft bill produced in 1927 (and never adopted) provided, under the heading “Substantive Rights”, that: “Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Crown shall, notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, be liable in tort.” This provision was made subject to clause29(1)(g) which read: “Except as therein otherwise expressly provided, nothing in this Act shall– ... (g)entitle any member of the armed forces of the Crown to make a claim against the Crown in respect of any matter relating to or arising out of or in connection with the discipline or duties of those forces or the regulations relating thereto, or the performance or enforcement or purported performance or enforcement thereof by any member of those forces, or other matters connected with or ancillary to any of the matters aforesaid ...” 76.The 1947 Act made far-reaching changes, both substantive and procedural, to the Crown's liability to be sued. 77.The 1947 Act was divided into four parts: Part I “Substantive law” (sections 1-12 of the Act); Part II “Jurisdiction and procedure”; Part III “Judgments and execution”; and Part IV “Miscellaneous”. 78.Section 1 provides for the Crown to be sued as of right rather than by a petition of right sanctioned by Royal fiat. 79.Section 2 of the 1947 Act provides: “Liability of the Crown in tort (1)Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Crown shall be subject to all those liabilities in tort to which, if it were a private person of full age and capacity, it would be subject:– (a)in respect of torts committed by its servants or agents; (b)in respect of any breach of those duties which a person owes to his servants or agents at common law by reason of being their employer; and (c)in respect of any breach of the duties attaching at common law to the ownership, occupation, possession or control of property: Provided that no proceedings shall lie against the Crown by virtue of paragraph (a) of this subsection in respect of any act or omission of a servant or agent of the Crown unless the act or omission would, apart from the provisions of this Act, have given rise to a cause of action in tort against that servant or agent or his estate.” 80.Members of the armed forces were to be treated differently. If they died or were injured in the course of their duties, the Crown could not be sued in tort once the Secretary of State certified that the death or injury would be treated as attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to a war pension. In particular, section 10 of the 1947 Act was entitled “Provisions relating to the armed forces” and provided as follows: “(1)Nothing done or omitted to be done by a member of the armed forces of the Crown while on duty as such shall subject either him or the Crown to liability in tort for causing the death of another person, or for causing personal injury to another person, in so far as the death or personal injury is due to anything suffered by that other person while he is a member of the armed forces of the Crown if– (a)at the time when that thing is suffered by that other person, he is either on duty as a member of the armed forces of the Crown or is, though not on duty as such, on any land, premises, ship, aircraft or vehicle for the time being used for the purposes of the armed forces of the Crown; and (b)the [Secretary of State] certifies that his suffering that thing has been or will be treated as attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to an award under the Royal Warrant, Order in Council or Order of His Majesty relating to the disablement or death of members of the force of which he is a member: Provided that this subsection shall not exempt a member of the said forces from liability in tort in any case in which the court is satisfied that the act or omission was not connected with the execution of his duties as a member of those forces. (2)No proceedings in tort shall lie against the Crown for death or personal injury due to anything suffered by a member of the armed forces of the Crown if– (a)that thing is suffered by him in consequence of the nature or condition of any such land, premises, ship, aircraft or vehicle as aforesaid, or in consequence of the nature or condition of any equipment or supplies used for the purposes of those forces; and (b)the [Secretary of State] certifies as mentioned in the preceding subsection; nor shall any act or omission of an officer of the Crown subject him to liability in tort for death or personal injury, in so far as the death or personal injury is due to anything suffered by a member of the armed forces of the Crown being a thing as to which the conditions aforesaid are satisfied. (3)... a Secretary of State, if satisfied that it is the fact:– (a)that a person was or was not on any particular occasion on duty as a member of the armed forces of the Crown; or (b)that at any particular time any land, premises, ship, aircraft, vehicle, equipment or supplies was or was not, or were or were not, used for the purposes of the said forces; may issue a certificate certifying that to be the fact; and any such certificate shall, for the purpose of this section, be conclusive as to the fact which it certifies.” The words in section 2 of the 1947 Act “subject to the provisions of this Act” rendered section 2 subject to the provisions of section 10 of the 1947Act. 81.The exception contained in section 10 of the 1947 Act was removed by the 1987 Act. This removal was not retrospective. Accordingly, after 1987 claims in tort by members of the armed forces (or their estates) who had died or been injured as a result of conduct that took place prior to 1987 could not proceed if the Secretary of State issued the relevant certificate. The reasons the law was prospective only were explained by the member of parliament introducing the bill as follows (Hansard, HC, 13February 1987, col. 572): “Successive Governments have resisted retrospective legislation as a basic concept, especially where such legislation imposes a retrospective liability on others. Secondly, it would be clearly wrong to impose retrospective liability on a serviceman for past actions, even if the Crown, his employer, were to stand behind him. That would involve individuals who are alleged to be guilty of negligence over the years being brought to book in a court of law for actions [for] which, at the time they were committed, they were not liable under the law. That is a strong argument against retrospective legislation. Thirdly, ... where should the line be drawn in dealing with past claims so as to be fair and just towards all claimants? How could there be a logical cut-off point for considering claims either by the [MOD] or the courts. How could those whose claims which fell on the wrong side of the arbitrary line be satisfied? How could the [MOD], and ultimately the courts, be expected to assess old cases where the necessary documentary evidence or witnesses are no longer available? Those are practical questions to which, sadly, there are no ready answers. For that reason, I believe that the only reasonable course of action is to legislate for the repeal of section 10 from the date of enactment.” 82.Section 11 of this Act provides that any action for damages for personal injury must be brought within three years of the cause of action arising. 83.Mr Matthews served in the Royal Navy between 1955 and 1968. In 2001 he brought proceedings in negligence against the MOD (alleging the MOD's negligence and breach of statutory duty and its vicarious liability for the negligence and breach of duty of his fellow servicemen) claiming that he had suffered personal injury as a result of his exposure to asbestos fibres and dust while performing his duties as a serviceman. 84.On the preliminary issue of whether the MOD could be sued under section 10 of the 1947 Act, the High Court found that provision to be incompatible with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. 85.In deciding whether section 10 amounted to a procedural or substantive limitation on his rights, the High Court considered that the issue turned on whether a section 10 certificate extinguished not only MrMatthews' right to sue for damages but also his primary right arising from the Crown's duty of care: “If, after the passing of the 1947 Act, he had the primary right not to be exposed to asbestos in circumstances amounting to negligence or breach of statutory duty, section10 merely extinguished his secondary right to claim damages for its breach, and that would amount merely to a procedural bar on his secondary right to claim his preferred remedy for breach of his primary right.” In concluding that section 10 amounted to a procedural bar to an existing right of action in tort and in thus finding Article 6 applicable, the High Court relied, in particular, on Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 10 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV) and Fogarty v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 37112/97, ECHR 2001-XI). 86.The limitation therefore had to be subjected to a proportionality test. In this respect, the High Court concluded that the disadvantages of a pension scheme were such that access to it was an “exceptionally, indeed an unacceptably” high price to pay for the advantage of not having to prove fault, an advantage that would only apply when the question of the fault of the other party was in doubt. Neither was the High Court convinced that the choice to repeal the 1947 Act prospectively was proportionate, considering, inter alia, that the finding of liability for conduct that was not a basis for liability when it took place was far less pernicious a solution than denying proper damages to persons injured as a result of negligence. 87.The Court of Appeal allowed the MOD's appeal. Section 10 had a substantive and not procedural effect and the High Court's reliance on Fogarty, cited above, was mistaken. The Master of the Rolls stated that: “The requirement in section 10 for a certificate from the Secretary of State as a precondition to defeating a claimant's cause of action is an unusual one and not easily analysed, and it cannot be treated simply as an option to impose a procedural bar on the claim.” 88.In so finding, the Court of Appeal rejected the MOD's objection, based on Pellegrin v. France ([GC], no. 28541/95, ECHR 1999VIII) and, more recently, R. v. Belgium (no. 33919/96, 27 February 2001), to the applicability of Article 6 § 1, the Court of Appeal finding that Pellegrin was concerned solely with “disputes raised by servants of the State over their conditions of service” whereas the proceedings before the Court of Appeal concerned the nature and effect of section 10 of the 1947 Act on a claim in tort against the MOD. 89.The applicant appealed, arguing that the Court of Appeal had ignored a clear principle established by Fogarty. The MOD did not pursue the Pellegrin argument. 90.The House of Lords (Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord Millett and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe) unanimously rejected the appeal. The House of Lords considered the maintenance of the distinction between procedural and substantive limitations on access to a court to be a necessary one since Article 6 was concerned with procedural fairness and the integrity of a State's judicial system rather than with the substantive content of its national law. However, the House of Lords acknowledged the difficulty in tracing the borderline between the substantive and procedural, considering the Convention jurisprudence to be indicative of some difficulty in this respect. Drawing on the text, historical context, legislative intent and the actual operation of section 10 of the 1947 Act and, further, on a comprehensive analysis of the Convention jurisprudence and applicable principles, the House of Lords concluded that section 10 of the 1947 Act maintained the existing lack of liability in tort of the Crown to service personnel for injury suffered that was attributable to service and served to ease servicemen towards the no-fault pension option by taking away the need to prove attributability. It amounted therefore to a substantive limitation on the liability of the Crown in tort to servicemen for service injury to which Article 6 § 1 did not apply. 91.Having reviewed the Convention jurisprudence, Lord Bingham noted that, whatever the difficulty in tracing the dividing line between procedural and substantive limitations of a given entitlement under domestic law, an accurate analysis of a claimant's substantive rights in domestic law was, nonetheless, an essential first step towards deciding whether he had, for the purposes of the autonomous meaning given to the expression by the Convention, a “civil right” such as would engage Article 6. Lord Bingham went on to outline the historical evolution of section 10, considering it clear that there was no parliamentary intention to confer any substantive right to claim damages. “Few common-law rules were better-established or more unqualified”, he began, “than that which precluded any claim in tort against the Crown” and because “there was no wrong of which a claimant could complain (because the King could do no wrong) relief by petition of right was not available”. Claims referred to as “exempted claims” against the Crown for damages for, inter alia, injury sustained by armed forces personnel while on duty were “absolutely barred”. When proposals for reform were put forward in the 1920s, “no cause of action was proposed in relation to the exempted claims”. When the Crown Proceedings Bill was introduced into Parliament in 1947 it again provided that the exempted claims should be “absolutely barred”, but those fulfilling the qualifying condition would be compensated by the award of a pension on a no-fault basis. When what was to become section 10(1) was amended uncontentiously in the House of Commons, the intention was not to alter the “essential thrust of the provision as previously drafted”. The object of the new certification procedure was to “ease the path of those denied any right to a common-law claim towards obtaining a pension, by obviating the need to prove attributability, an essential qualifying condition for the award of a pension”. Whereas the issue of a certificate under section 10(3) of the 1947 Act was discretionary as shown by the permissive “may”, no such permissive language applied to the issuance of a certificate under section 10(1)(b). “It was plainly intended that, where the conditions were met, the Secretary of State should issue a certificate as was the invariable practice of successive Secretaries of State over the next forty years.” Although different language had been used over the years, “the English courts had consistently regarded section 10(1) as precluding any claim at common law”. It was in fact the “absolute nature of the exclusion imposed by section 10(1)” (coupled with the discrepancy, by 1987, between the value of a pension and of a claim for common-law damages) which fuelled the demand for the revocation of section 10 and led to the 1987 Act. In deciding whether section 10(1) imposed a procedural bar or denied any substantive right, regard had to be had to the practical realities and, in that respect, the Secretary of State's practice had been “uniform and unvarying” so that any practitioner would have advised Mr Matthews that a section 10 certificate was “bound to be issued”. Lord Bingham found Fogarty to be “categorically different” from Matthews and concluded, for reasons closely reflecting those of the Court of Appeal and of Lord Walker (see below), that the appeal was to be rejected. 92.As regards the distinction between substantive and procedural bars to a judicial remedy, Lord Walker conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Convention jurisprudence, highlighting what he considered to be inconsistencies and the difficulties in applying it: “127.The distinction between substantive and procedural bars to a judicial remedy has often been referred to in the jurisprudence on Article 6 § 1, but the cases do not speak with a single clear voice. That is hardly surprising. The distinction, although easy to grasp in extreme cases, becomes much more debatable close to the borderline, especially as different legal systems draw the line in different places ... ... 130.I have already referred to several of the most important cases, but it is useful to see how two contrasting themes have developed since the seminal Golder decision in 1975. Some cases emphasise the importance of avoiding any arbitrary or disproportionate restriction on a litigant's access to the court, whether or not the restriction should be classified as procedural in nature. Others attach importance to the distinction between substance and procedure. 131.The first case to note is Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom ... Section 141(1) [of the Mental Health Act 1959] imposed substantive restrictions on his rights of action (requiring bad faith or negligence) and subsection (2) imposed a procedural restriction (the need for the Court's permission for the commencement of proceedings). The Commission ... agreed with the parties that 'it is immaterial whether the measure is of a substantive or procedural character. It suffices to say that section141 acted as an unwaivable bar, which effectively restricted the applicant's claim in tort'. But the Commission considered that the restrictions were not arbitrary or unreasonable, being intended to protect hospital staff from ill-founded or vexatious litigation. The Court ... took a similar view. 132.In Pinder v. the United Kingdom ... (from which Ketterick and Dyer are not significantly different) the Commission took the view ... that section 10 of the 1947 Act brought about the substitution of a no-fault system of pension entitlement for the right to sue for damages, and that that removed the claimant's civil right: 'It follows, therefore, that the State does not bear the burden of justifying an immunity from liability which forms part of its civil law with reference to “a pressing social need” as contended by the applicant.' However the Commission then ... referred to its report in Ashingdane and stated: 'These principles apply not only in respect of procedural limitations such as the removal of the jurisdiction of the court, as in the Ashingdane case, but also in respect of a substantive immunity from liability as in the present case. The question, therefore, arises in the present context, whether section 10 of the 1947 Act constitutes an arbitrary limitation of the applicant's substantive civil claims.' 133.The Commission held that section 10 was not arbitrary or disproportionate ... 134.Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom ... was concerned with the effect of section 76(1) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 on persons complaining of noise from aircraft travelling to and from . Section 76(1) excludes liability for any action in trespass or nuisance so long as the height of the aircraft was reasonable in all the circumstances, and its flight was not in breach of the provisions of the Act or any order made under it. In unanimously rejecting the claimants' claim under Article 6 § 1 the European Court of Human Rights simply relied on the fact that the applicants had no substantive right to relief under English law. It rejected a subsidiary argument that the claimants' residuary entitlement to sue (in cases not excluded by section 6(1)) was illusory. 135.The Court's approach in Fayed v. the United Kingdom ... was much less straightforward. ... The Court's discussion of the relevant principles contained ... the following passage ...: 'Whether a person has an actionable domestic claim may depend not only on the substantive content, properly speaking, of the relevant civil right as defined under national law but also on the existence of procedural bars preventing or limiting the possibilities of bringing potential claims to court. In the latter kind of case Article 6 § 1 may have a degree of applicability. Certainly the Convention enforcement bodies may not create by way of interpretation of Article 6 § 1 a substantive civil right which has no legal basis in the State concerned. However, it would not be consistent with the rule of law in a democratic society or with the basic principle underlying Article 6 § 1 – namely that civil claims must be capable of being submitted to a judge for adjudication – if, for example, a State could, without restraint or control by the Convention enforcement bodies, remove from the jurisdiction of the courts a whole range of civil claims or confer immunities from civil liability on large groups or categories of persons.' 136.It is hard to tell how far the last sentence of this passage goes. The Court then referred ... to the distinction between substantive and procedural restrictions: 'It is not always an easy matter to trace the dividing line between procedural and substantive limitations of a given entitlement under domestic law. It may sometimes be no more than a question of legislative technique whether the limitation is expressed in terms of the right or its remedy.' The Court did not go any further in attempting to resolve this problem on the ground that it might in any case have had to consider issues of legitimate aim and proportionality for the purposes of Article 8 (respect for private life), even though there was in fact no complaint under Article 8. 137.In Stubbings v. the United Kingdom ... and Tinnelly & Sons Ltd v. the United Kingdom ..., the Court considered whether restrictions on access to the court (in section 2 of the Limitation Act 1980 and section 42 of the Fair Employment () Act 1976 respectively) were justifiable without adverting expressly to the distinction between substantive and procedural bars. In Waite and Kennedy v. ..., the Commission ... described the immunity as merely a procedural bar, and as such requiring justification. The Court took the same view, regarding ... the claimants' access to some unspecified procedures for alternative dispute resolution as being a material factor. 138.The two most recent cases are of particular importance. In Z [and Others] v. the United Kingdom ..., the Court ... held that there had been no breach of Article 6 § 1 in your Lordships' decision in X v. Bedfordshire County Council [1995] 2 AC 633 as to the responsibility of a local authority for children who had suffered neglect and abuse over a period of five years while their suffering was known to the local authority (but they were not the subject of any care order). ... The whole of the Court's judgment on Article 6 § 1 ... merits careful study, but its essence appears from the following passages ...: ... 'The Court is led to the conclusion that the inability of the applicants to sue the local authority flowed not from an immunity but from the applicable principles governing the substantive right of action in domestic law. There was no restriction on access to court of the kind contemplated in the Ashingdane judgment.' In reaching these conclusions the majority of the Court stated in plain terms that its decision in Osman had been based on a misunderstanding of the English law of negligence. 139.Finally there is Fogarty v. the United Kingdom ... That case was decided about six months after Z and by a constitution of the Court several of whose members had sat (and some of whom had dissented) in Z. In Fogarty the Court repeated verbatim ... the passage from Fayed which I have already quoted. It rejected ... the United Kingdom's argument that because of the operation of State immunity the claimant did not have a substantive right under domestic law. The Court attached importance to the United States' ability to waive (in fact the judgment said 'not choose to claim') immunity as indicating that the bar was procedural. Nevertheless, the Court concluded ... that: 'measures taken by a High Contracting Party which reflect generally recognised rules of public international law on State immunity cannot in principle be regarded as imposing a disproportionate restriction on the right of access to court as embodied in Article 6 § 1. Just as the right of access to court is an inherent part of the fair trial guarantee in that Article, so some restrictions on access must likewise be regarded as inherent, an example being those limitations generally accepted by the community of nations as part of the doctrine of State immunity.' 140.In trying to reconcile the inconsistencies in the jurisprudence it might be tempting to suppose that the Court's wide and rather speculative observations in Fayed (which were not its grounds for decision) marked a diversion which proved, in Z, to be a blind alley. But that explanation immediately runs into the difficulty that in Fogarty, six months after Z, the Court (constituted by many of the same judges) chose to repeat, word for word, the observations made in Fayed. The uncertain shadow of Osman still lies over this area of the law. 141.Nevertheless [Mr Matthews' counsel] conceded that in order to succeed on the appeal, he had to satisfy your Lordships that section 10 of the 1947 Act constituted a procedural bar. He equated this task with satisfying your Lordships that Mr Matthews had at the commencement of his proceedings a cause of action against the [MOD], and that that cause of action was cut off (or defeated) by the [MOD's] invocation of the section 10 procedure. He treated this event as indistinguishable from the government's invocation, in Fogarty, of the defence of State immunity (to be precise, its decision not to waive State immunity). In each case, [Mr Matthews' counsel] argued, the defendant was relying on a procedural bar to defeat a substantive claim which was valid when proceedings were commenced. 142.In my view, [Mr Matthews' counsel's] concession was rightly made. Although there are difficulties in defining the borderline between substance and procedure, the general nature of the distinction is clear in principle, and it is also clear that Article 6 is, in principle, concerned with the procedural fairness and integrity of a State's judicial system, not with the substantive content of its national law. The notion that a State should decide to substitute a no-fault system of compensation for some injuries which might otherwise lead to claims in tort is not inimical to Article 6 § 1, as the Commission said in Dyer ... (in a report, specifically dealing with section 10 of the 1947 Act, which has been referred to with approval by the Court in several later cases). 143.In the circumstances [Mr Matthews'] argument clings ever more closely to the bare fact that Mr Matthews had a cause of action when he issued his claim form, and that his claim could not be struck out as hopeless unless and until the Secretary of State issued a certificate under section 10. But European human rights law is concerned, not with superficial appearances or verbal formulae, but with the realities of the situation (Van Droogenbroeck v. ...). [Mr Matthews'] argument does, with respect, ignore the realities of the situation. It is common ground that the Secretary of State does in practice issue a certificate whenever it is (in legal and practical terms) appropriate to do so. He does not have a wide discretion comparable to that of a foreign government in deciding whether or not to waive State immunity (which may be by no means a foregone conclusion, especially in politically sensitive employment cases). The decision whether or not to waive immunity in Fogarty really was a decision about a procedural bar, but I am quite unpersuaded that it provides a parallel with this case. The fact is that section 10 of the 1947 Act did in very many cases before 1987, and still does in cases of latent injury sustained before 1987, substitute a no-fault system of compensation for a claim for damages. This was and is a matter of substantive law and the provision for an official certificate (in order to avoid or at least minimise the risk of inconsistent decisions on causation) does not alter that. Section 10(1)(b), taken on its own, is a provision for the protection of persons with claims against the [MOD]. I respectfully agree with Lord Bingham's analysis of the legislative history of the 1947 Act and with the conclusions which he draws from it. 144.In these circumstances I do not consider it necessary or desirable to attempt to assess whether section 10, if tested as a procedural bar, would meet the test of proportionality. There would be serious arguments either way and as it is not necessary to express a view I prefer not to do so.” 93.Lord Hoffmann agreed with Lord Walker's reasoning and conclusions and made certain additional observations. He noted that Mr Matthews' counsel (also counsel for the present applicant) had conceded that, if the 1947 Act simply said that servicemen had no right of action, it would not have infringed Article 6. Mr Matthews argued, however, that the structure of the 1947 Act was such that he had a civil right (a cause of action in tort) until a section 10 certificate was issued; if no certificate had been issued he would have been able to prosecute his action before the courts; and section10 therefore gave the Secretary of State a power at his discretion to cut off the applicant's action and prevent him from bringing it before the courts. Lord Hoffmann pointed out that, if the purpose of section 10(1)(b) and (2)(b) had been to give the Secretary of State a discretionary power “to swoop down and prevent people with claims against the Crown from bringing them before the courts”, he would have agreed since such executive interference would run counter to the rule of law and the principle of the separation of powers. However, referring to the historical analysis of Lord Bingham, he considered it clear that section 10 delimited the substantive cause of action and the section 10 certificate was no more than a binding acknowledgment by the Secretary of State of the “attributable to service” requirement for an award of a pension, the quid pro quo for the inability to sue in tort. He too considered distinguishable Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others (Matthews did not involve any encroachment by the executive upon the functions of the judicial branch) and Fogarty (having regard to the discretion available to the foreign government to submit or not to jurisdiction). 94.Lord Hope analysed in some detail the Convention jurisprudence and principles, the history of the 1947 Act, the text and operation of section10 and the section 10 certification process. He noted: “72.The overall context is provided by the fact that section 10 falls within the same Part [I] of the Act as section 2. Section 2, by which the basic rules for the Crown's liability in tort are laid down, is expressed to be 'subject to the provisions of this Act'. Section 10 is an integral part of the overall scheme of liability which is described in Part I of the Act. This was all new law. None of the provisions in this Part which preserved the Crown's immunity from suit in particular cases could be said, when the legislation was enacted, to be removing from anybody a right to claim which he previously enjoyed. 73.As for section 10 itself, ... [i]t proceeds on the assumption that if a claim is made under section 2 of the Act the Secretary of State will have to form a view, on the facts, as to whether or not the case is covered by the immunity. The Secretary of State is told that he cannot have it both ways. He is not allowed to assert the immunity without making a statement in the form of a certificate in the terms which the condition lays down. This has the effect of preventing him, as the minister responsible for the administration of the war pension scheme, from contesting the issue whether the suffering of the thing was attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to an award under that scheme. This is a matter of substantive law. It is an essential part of the overall scheme for the reform of the law which the 1947 Act laid down. It does not take anything away from the claimant which he had before. On the contrary, it has been inserted into the scheme of the Act for his benefit.” Lord Hope concluded, in full agreement with the reasons expressed by Lord Walker, that section 10 amounted to a substantive limitation on the right to sue the Crown in tort. 95.Lord Millett's judgment also contained a comprehensive assessment of the Court's jurisprudence, the historical context and text of section 10 and the consequent purpose of the section 10 certificate. He noted: “If the serviceman brought proceedings against the Crown for damages, the question at once arose whether his injury was sustained in circumstances which qualified him for a pension, for if it was the Crown was not liable in damages. Sometimes the Secretary of State had already conceded, or the Tribunal had already found, that whatever the serviceman claimed to be the cause of his injury was attributable to service in the armed forces of the Crown. If so he would grant a certificate to that effect and the action would be struck out on the ground that it disclosed no cause of action. ... In such circumstances the Secretary of State had no discretion whether to grant or withhold a certificate. He was called on to certify an existing state of facts which prevented the proceedings from having any chance of success. It was his duty as a public servant to ascertain the facts and certify or not accordingly.” Lord Millett considered it plain that the section 10 certificate did not operate as a procedural bar to prevent the serviceman from having his civil right judicially determined. As regards Fogarty, and unlike the other Law Lords, he considered that immunities claimed by a State which conformed to generally accepted norms of international law fell outside Article 6 entirely. For the reasons outlined by each of their Lordships with which he agreed, he would also dismiss the appeal. 96.The scheme currently in force for the payment of a service pension in respect of, inter alia, illnesses and injuries attributable to service is contained in the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983 (“the Pensions Order”). 97.The basic condition for the award of a pension is that “the disablement or death of a member of the armed forces is due to service” (Article 3 of the Pensions Order). “Disablement” is defined as “physical or mental injury or damage, or loss of physical or mental capacity” (Schedule4 to the Pensions Order). Where claims are made more than seven years after the termination of service, Article 5(1)(a) provides that the disablement or death is to be treated as “due to service” if it is due to an injury which is either attributable to service after 2 September 1939 or existed before or arose during such service and was and continues to be aggravated by it. 98.The Pensions Order provides that where, upon reliable evidence, a reasonable doubt exists whether the above conditions are fulfilled, the benefit of that doubt must be given to the claimant (Article 5(4)). 99.The scheme for the payment of pensions is administered by a specialised agency of the DSS, formerly the War Pensions Agency (“WPA”) and now the Veterans Agency (“VA”). On receipt of an application, the VA, inter alia, obtains the claimant's service records (including service medical records) from the MOD and, with the assistance of additional medical evidence if required, assesses whether the claimant is suffering from a disability attributable to service. The Secretary of State decides on the basis of this assessment whether to award a service pension. 100.A claimant who is refused a war pension by the Secretary of State may appeal to the PAT (see the Pensions Appeal Tribunals Act 1943) in accordance with the PAT Rules. This body is composed of a lawyer, a doctor and a serviceman or ex-serviceman of the same sex and rank as the claimant. 101.The VA provides the PAT with a Statement of Case, which includes, inter alia, a transcript of the claimant's service records including service medical records, civilian medical records and reports including those prepared at the request of the VA and a statement outlining the Secretary of State's reasons for refusing the application. The claimant may submit an answer to the Statement of Case and/or adduce further evidence. A hearing then takes place. The PAT examination is de novo so that the appellant does not have to show that the Secretary of State's decision was wrong. A further appeal lies to the High Court on a point of law with leave from the PAT or the High Court. 102.Rule 6 of the PAT Rules (“the Rule 6 procedure”) is entitled “Disclosure of official documents and information” and provides as follows: “(1)Where for the purposes of his appeal an appellant desires to have disclosed any document, or part of any document, which he has reason to believe is in the possession of a government department, he may, at any time not later than six weeks after the Statement of Case was sent to him, apply to the President for the disclosure of the document or part and, if the President considers that the document or part is likely to be relevant to any issue to be determined on the appeal, he may give a direction to the department concerned requiring its disclosure (if in the possession of the department) in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the President may think fit: ... (2)On receipt of a direction given by the President under this rule, the Secretary of State or Minister in charge of the government department concerned, or any person authorised by him in that behalf, may certify to the President – (a)that it would be contrary to the public interest for the whole or part of the document to which the direction relates to be disclosed publicly; or (b)that the whole or part of the document ought not, for reasons of security, to be disclosed in any manner whatsoever; and where a certificate is given under sub-paragraph (a), the President shall give such directions to the tribunal as may be requisite for prohibiting or restricting the disclosure in public of the document, or part thereof, as the case may be, and where a certificate is given under sub-paragraph (b) the President shall direct the tribunal to consider whether the appellant's case will be prejudiced if the appeal proceeds without such disclosure, and, where the tribunal are of the opinion that the appellant would be prejudiced if the appeal were to proceed without such disclosure, they shall adjourn the hearing of the appeal until such time as the necessity for non-disclosure on the ground of security no longer exists.” 103.Prior to 1991 all medical records (civilian or service) were only disclosed on a “medical in confidence” basis. It was a matter for the doctor to decide if it was in the patient's best interests to see his or her records. The 1990 Act came into force on 1 November 1991 and it sets down the rights of persons to access, inter alia, their service and civilian medical records. It applies only to records compiled after the date of its entry into force and to records compiled “in connection with the care of the applicant”.",2005,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

"
178,001-58298,Grand Chamber,"8.The applicant is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1957 and lives in Istanbul.>At the material time, the applicant was the major shareholder in Deniz Basın Yayın Sanayi ve Ticaret Organizasyon, a Turkish limited liability company which owns a weekly review entitled Haberde Yorumda Gerçek (The Truth of News and Comments), published in Istanbul. 10.In issue no. 51 of the review, dated 13 March 1993, a news commentary entitled “Kawa and Dehak Once Again” was published. The article analysed possible events, which could occur during the upcoming celebrations of Newroz. 11.A translation of the relevant parts of the news commentary is as follows: “... It’s Newroz week in Kurdistan. The biggest confrontation between the demands of the Kurdish people and intolerance in the face of the expression of these demands occurs during these days. The tradition of rebellion is awakened. Dehak and Kawa are once again invested with flesh and bones. It is time to settle accounts. There is nothing vague about Kawa. All the mountains, all the cities are full of Kawa. There are millions of them. All right, who, then, is Dehak? Who is the candidate for representing Dehak in our day? Is it Demirel? Is it Güreş? The regional Governor? Or the new commander İlter? This time round, is Dehak represented by every counter-insurgency chief, indeed, every counter-insurgency operative, every special team member, every police commissioner or superintendent officer? Has Dehak become anonymous too? Be it as it may, but Dehak and Kawa will settle their accounts once again. ... Last year, a revolutionary publication described the days preceding Newroz as follows: ‘Nowadays over 200 thousand soldiers massed into Kurdistan. Tanks and weapons are sent over. Bombs are raining on Kurdish villages and mountains. The Chief of the General Staff has inspected the preparations for the offensive. Instructions are being issued to provincial and district governors, special team leaders, police chiefs and military officials. The Head of MİT intelligence agency talks of the prospect of much blood being shed. Members of Parliament are organising information-gathering trips in order to take the pulse of the people.’ ... Unlike previous years, the PKK-leaning Kurdistan National Assembly (KUM) is also expected to take on a role during Newroz this year. ... On the other hand emergency measures are being implemented in large cities outside Kurdistan where there are concentrations of Kurdish people. It is highly likely that there will be large demonstrations in the Kurdish quarters there.” 12.In the same issue and within the context of the above news commentary, an interview was also published by the Kurdish News Agency with a representative of the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan (“the ERNK”), the political wing of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (“the PKK”). Both organisations are illegal under Turkish law. 13.A translation of the relevant part of the interview is as follows: “... We wish to emphasise this finding, indeed, we feel that it ought to be underlined. And we call on all European countries. We are open to any humanitarian, political solution, including the calls for an armistice. The PKK movement and its struggle are absolutely not terrorist movements. This misapprehension must be abandoned – it must definitely be abandoned – and a move must be made towards co-operation and support. The real terrorist is the Republic of Turkey. We believe that attitudes on this matter will be much clarified this year, that very positive dialogues will develop and that the Republic of Turkey will be gradually further isolated.” 14.On 14 March 1993 the Istanbul National Security Court (İstanbul Devlet Güvenlik Mahkemesi) ordered the seizure of all copies of issue no.51 of the review, since it allegedly disseminated separatist propaganda. 15.In an indictment dated 22 April 1993, the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court, on account of the publication of the above news commentary, charged the applicant in his capacity as the owner of the review with disseminating propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. He was also charged with publishing the declaration of the ERNK (see paragraph 12 above). The charges were brought under sections 8 and 6 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (hereinafter “the 1991 Act”: see paragraphs 24 and 25 below), respectively. 16.In the proceedings before the Istanbul National Security Court, the applicant denied the charges. He pleaded that the incriminated news commentary did not fall within the scope of section 8 of the 1991 Act. He maintained that arguing and commenting on possible activities in which the PKK might engage during the Newroz celebrations could not be regarded as publishing a declaration of a terrorist organisation within the meaning of section 6 of the 1991 Act. As regards his freedom of expression, the applicant referred to Article 10 of the Convention and the case-law of the Commission and the Court. He stated that pluralism of opinion was essential in a democratic society including opinions which shock or offend. He argued that the provisions of sections 6 and 8 of the 1991 Act restricted freedom of expression in contravention of the Turkish Constitution and the criteria laid down in the case-law of the Commission and the Court. 17.In a judgment dated 27 September 1993, the Istanbul National Security Court found the applicant guilty of an offence under section 8 § 2 of the 1991 Act. The court first sentenced the applicant to a fine of 100,000,000 Turkish liras. However, having regard to the applicant’s good conduct during the trial, it reduced the fine to 83,333,333 Turkish liras. 18.In its reasoning, the court held that the incriminated news commentary contravened section 8 of the 1991 Act. The court concluded that it referred to a certain part of the Turkish territory as “Kurdistan” as well as a certain section of the population as “Kurds”, and amounted to propaganda against the indivisibility of the Turkish State. The court further observed that the review had also published the declaration of an illegal terrorist organisation in which the Republic of Turkey was referred to as a terrorist State. However, it considered that the declaration constituted part of the incriminated news commentary. Having regard to the provisions of Article 79 of the Turkish Criminal Code, the court found no grounds for a separate conviction under section 6 of the 1991 Act. 19.The applicant appealed against his conviction to the Court of Cassation. He relied on the defence grounds which he had invoked at his trial before the National Security Court. 20.On 8 February 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal, upholding the National Security Court’s reasoning and its assessment of the evidence. On 29 November 1995 the applicant paid the last instalment of the fine imposed on him. 21.Following the amendments made by Law No. 4126 of 27October1995 to the 1991 Act (see paragraphs 24 and 25 below), the Istanbul National Security Court ex officio re-examined the applicant’s case. On 22 April 1996 the court ruled that these amendments did not affect the applicant’s case as his sentence had already been executed. 22.The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows: Article 36 § 1 “In the event of conviction, the court shall order the seizure and confiscation of any object which has been used for the commission or preparation of the crime or offence…” Article 79 “A person who infringes various provisions of this Code by a single act, shall be punished under the provision which prescribes the heaviest punishment.” 23.The relevant provisions of the Press Act 1950 read as follows: Section 3 “For the purposes of the present Law, the term ‘periodicals’ shall mean newspapers, press agency dispatches and any other printed matter published at regular intervals. ‘Publication’ shall mean the exposure, display, distribution, emission, sale or offer for sale of printed matter on premises to which the public have access where anyone may see it. An offence shall not be deemed to have been committed through the medium of the press unless publication has taken place, except where the material in itself is unlawful.” 24.The relevant provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 read as follows: Section 6 “It shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to announce, orally or in the form of a publication, that terrorist organisations will commit an offence against a specific person, whether or not that person’s ... identity is divulged provided that it is done in such a manner that he or she may be identified, or to reveal the identity of civil servants who have participated in anti-terrorist operations or to designate any person as a target. It shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to print or publish declarations or leaflets emanating from terrorist organisations. … Where the offences contemplated in the above paragraphs are committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the sales of the previous issue if the periodical appears monthly or less frequently, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched. However, the fine may not be less than fifty million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher.” Section 8 (before amendment by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited, irrespective of the methods used and the intention. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than two and not more than five years’ imprisonment and a fine of from fifty million to one hundred million Turkish liras. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the above paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched. However the fine may not be less than one hundred million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical concerned shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher and sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment.” Section 8 (as amended by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than one and not more than three years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras. The penalty imposed on a reoffender may not be commuted to a fine. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly. However, the fine may not be less than one hundred million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical concerned shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher and sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of printed matter or by means of mass communication other than periodicals within the meaning of the second paragraph, those responsible and the owners of the means of mass communication shall be sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras… …” 25.The following amendments were made to the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 after the enactment of Law 4126 of 27 October 1995: Temporary provision relating to section 2 “In the month following the entry into force of the present Law, the court which has given judgment shall re-examine the case of a person convicted pursuant to section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) and, in accordance with the amendment ... to section 8 of Law no. 3713, shall reconsider the term of imprisonment imposed on that person and decide whether he should be allowed the benefit of sections 4 and 6 of Law no.647 of 13 July 1965.” 26.The Code of Criminal Procedure contains the following provisions: Article 307 “An appeal on points of law may not concern any issue other than the lawfulness of the impugned judgment. Non-application or erroneous application of a legal rule shall constitute unlawfulness.” Article 308 “Unlawfulness is deemed to be manifest in the following cases: 1- where the court is not established in accordance with the law; 2- where one of the judges who have taken the decision was barred by statute from participating; …” 27.The Government supplied copies of several decisions given by the prosecutor attached to the Istanbul National Security Court withdrawing charges against persons suspected of inciting people to hatred or hostility, especially on religious grounds (Article 312 of the Criminal Code), or of disseminating separatist propaganda against the indivisible unity of the State (section8 of Law no. 3713 – see paragraph 23 above). In the majority of cases where offences had been committed by means of publications the reasons given for the prosecutor’s decisions included such considerations as the fact that the proceedings were time-barred, that some of the constituent elements of the offence could not be made out or that there was insufficient evidence. Other grounds included the fact that the publications in issue had not been distributed, that there had been no unlawful intent, that no offence had been committed or that those responsible could not be identified. 28.Furthermore, the Government submitted a number of decisions of the National Security Courts as examples of cases in which defendants accused of the above-mentioned offences had been found not guilty. These were the following judgments: 19 November (no.1996/428) and 27December 1996 (no. 1996/519); 6 March (no.1997/33), 3 June (no.1997/102), 17 October (no. 1997/527), 24October (no. 1997/541) and 23 December 1997 (no. 1997/606); 21January (no. 1998/8), 3 February (no.1998/14), 19 March (no. 1998/56), 21 April 1998 (no. 1998/87) and 17June 1998 (no. 1998/133). 29.As regards more particularly proceedings against authors of works dealing with the Kurdish problem, the National Security Courts in these cases reached their decisions on the ground that there had been no dissemination of “propaganda”, one of the constituent elements of the offence, or on account of the scientific, historical and/or objective nature of the words used. 30.The constitutional provisions governing judicial organisation of the National Security Courts are worded as follows: Article 138 §§ 1 and 2 “In the performance of their duties, judges shall be independent; they shall give judgment, according to their personal conviction, in accordance with the Constitution, statute and the law. No organ, authority, ... or ... person may give orders or instructions to courts or judges in the exercise of their judicial powers, or send them circulars or make recommendations or suggestions to them.” Article 139 § 1 “Judges … shall not be removed from office or compelled to retire without their consent before the age prescribed by the Constitution…” Article 143 §§ 1-5 “National Security Courts shall be established to try offences against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the territorial integrity of the State or the indivisible unity of the nation or against the free democratic system of government, and offences which directly affect the State’s internal or external security. National Security Courts shall be composed of a president, two other regular members, two substitute members, a prosecutor and a sufficient number of assistant prosecutors. The president, one of the regular members, one of the substitutes and the prosecutor, shall be appointed from among judges and public prosecutors of the first rank, according to procedures laid down in special legislation; one regular member and one substitute shall be appointed from among military judges of the first rank and the assistant prosecutors from among public prosecutors and military judges. Presidents, regular members and substitute members ... of National Security Courts shall be appointed for a renewable period of four years. Appeal against decisions of National Security Courts shall lie to the Court of Cassation. ...” Article 145 § 4 “Military legal proceedings “The personal rights and obligations of military judges … shall be regulated by law in accordance with the principles of the independence of the courts, the safeguards enjoyed by the judiciary and the requirements of military service. Relations between military judges and the commanders under whom they serve in the performance of their non-judicial duties shall also be regulated by law...” 31.Based on Article 143 of the Constitution, the relevant provisions of Law no. 2845 on the National Security Courts, provide as follows: Section 1 “In the capitals of the provinces of … National Security Courts shall be established to try persons accused of offences against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the territorial integrity of the State or the indivisible unity of the nation or against the free, democratic system of government and offences directly affecting the State’s internal or external security.” Section 3 “The National Security Courts shall be composed of a president, two other regular members and two substitute members.” Section 5 “The president of a National Security Court, one of the [two] regular members and one of the [two] substitutes ... shall be civilian … judges, the other members, whether regular or substitute, military judges of the first rank…” Section 6(2) and (6) “The appointment of military judges to sit as regular members and substitutes shall be carried out according to the procedure laid down for that purpose in the Military Legal Service Act. Except as provided in the present Law or other legislation, the president and the regular or substitute members of the National Security Courts … may not be appointed to another post or place, without their consent, within four years… … If, after an investigation concerning the president or a regular or substitute member of a National Security Court conducted according to the legislation concerning them, competent committees or authorities decide to change the duty station of the person concerned, the duty station of that judge or the duties themselves … may be changed in accordance with the procedure laid down in that legislation.” Section 9(1)(a) “National Security Courts shall have jurisdiction to try persons charged with (a) the offences contemplated in Article 312 § 2 … of the Turkish Criminal Code …, … (d)offences having a connection with the events which made it necessary to declare a state of emergency, in regions where a state of emergency has been declared in accordance with Article 120 of the Constitution, (e)offences committed against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the indivisible unity of the State – meaning both the national territory and its people – or against the free, democratic system of government and offences directly affecting the State’s internal or external security. …” Section 27(1) “The Court of Cassation shall hear appeals against the judgments of the National Security Courts.” Section 34(1) and (2) “The rules governing the rights and obligations of … military judges appointed to the National Security Courts and their supervision …, the institution of disciplinary proceedings against them, the imposition of disciplinary penalties on them and the investigation and prosecution of any offences they may commit in the performance of their duties ... shall be as laid down in the relevant provisions of the laws governing their profession… The observations of the Court of Cassation on military judges, the assessment reports on them drawn up by Ministry of Justice assessors … and the files on any investigations conducted in respect of them … shall be transmitted to the Ministry of Justice.” Section 38 “A National Security Court may be transformed into a Martial Law Court, under the conditions set forth below, where a state of emergency has been declared in all or part of the territory in respect of which the National Security Court concerned has jurisdiction, provided that within that territory there is more than one National Security Court…” 32.The relevant provisions of the Military Legal Service Act are worded as follows: Additional section 7 “The aptitude of military judges … appointed as regular or substitute members of the National Security Courts that is required for promotion or advancement in salary step, rank or seniority shall be determined on the basis of assessment reports drawn up according to the procedure laid down below, subject to the provisions of the present Law and the Turkish Armed Forces Personnel Act (Law no. 926). (a)The first superior competent to carry out assessment and draw up assessment reports for military judges, whether regular or substitute members … shall be the Minister of State in the Ministry of Defence, followed by the Minister of Defence. …” Additional section 8 “Members … of the National Security Courts belonging to the Military Legal Service … shall be appointed by a committee composed of the personnel director and the legal adviser of the General Staff, the personnel director and the legal adviser attached to the staff of the arm in which the person concerned is serving and the Director of Military Judicial Affairs at the Ministry of Defence…” Section 16(1) and (3) “Military judges … shall be appointed by a decree issued jointly by the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister and submitted to the President of the Republic for approval, in accordance with the provisions on the appointment and transfer of members of the armed forces… … The procedure for appointment as a military judge shall take into account the opinion of the Court of Cassation, the reports by Ministry of Justice assessors and the assessment reports drawn up by the superiors…” Section 18(1) “The rules governing the salary scales, salary increases and various personal rights of military judges … shall be as laid down in the provisions relating to officers.” Section 29 “The Minister of Defence may apply to military judges, after considering their defence submissions, the following disciplinary sanctions: A.A warning, which consists in giving the person concerned notice in writing that he must exercise more care in the performance of his duties. … B.A reprimand, which consists in giving the person concerned notice in writing that a particular act or a particular attitude has been found to be blameworthy. … The said sanctions shall be final, mentioned in the assessment record of the person concerned and entered in his personal file…” Section 38 “When military judges … sit in court they shall wear the special dress of their civilian counterparts…” 33.Article 112 of the Military Criminal Code of 22 May 1930 provides: “It shall be an offence, punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment, to abuse one’s authority as a civil servant in order to influence the military courts.” 34.Under section 22, the First Division of the Supreme Military Administrative Court has jurisdiction to hear applications for judicial review and claims for damages based on disputes relating to the personal status of officers, particularly those concerning their professional advancement.",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1.
III.	APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION
75.  THE APPLICANT CLAIMED COMPENSATION FOR PECUNIARY AND NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE AS WELL AS REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE DOMESTIC AND CONVENTION PROCEEDINGS. ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION STIPULATES IN THIS RESPECT:

121,001-59454,Grand Chamber,"13.The complaints raised in this application arise out of the Turkish military operations in northern Cyprus in July and August 1974 and the continuing division of the . At the time of the Court's consideration of the merits of the Loizidou v. case in 1996, the Turkish military presence at the material time was described in the following terms (Loizidou v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996 (merits), Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, p. 2223, §§ 16-17): “16.Turkish armed forces of more than 30,000 personnel are stationed throughout the whole of the occupied area of northern , which is constantly patrolled and has checkpoints on all main lines of communication. The army's headquarters are in Kyrenia. The 28th Infantry Division is based in Asha (Assia) with its sector covering Famagusta to the Mia Milia suburb of and with about 14,500 personnel. The 39th Infantry Division, with about 15,500 personnel, is based at Myrtou village, and its sector ranges from Yerolakkos village to Lefka. TOURDYK (Turkish Forces in Cyprus under the Treaty of Guarantee) is stationed at Orta Keuy village near Nicosia, with a sector running from Nicosia International Airport to the . A Turkish naval command and outpost are based at and Kyrenia respectively. Turkish airforce personnel are based at Lefkoniko, Krini and other airfields. The Turkish airforce is stationed on the Turkish mainland at . 17.The Turkish forces and all civilians entering military areas are subject to Turkish military courts, as stipulated so far as concerns 'TRNC citizens' by the Prohibited Military Areas Decree of 1979 (section 9) and Article 156 of the Constitution of the 'TRNC'.” 14.A major development in the continuing division of Cyprus occurred in November 1983 with the proclamation of the “Turkish Republic of Northern ” (the “TRNC”) and the subsequent enactment of the “TRNC Constitution” on 7 May 1985. This development was condemned by the international community. On 18 November 1983 the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution541 (1983) declaring the proclamation of the establishment of the “TRNC” legally invalid and calling upon all States not to recognise any Cypriot State other than the Republic of Cyprus. A similar call was made by the Security Council on 11 May 1984 in its Resolution 550 (1984). In November 1983 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe decided that it continued to regard the government of the Republic of Cyprus as the sole legitimate government of Cyprus and called for respect of the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of the . 15.According to the respondent Government, the “TRNC” is a democratic and constitutional State which is politically independent of all other sovereign States including Turkey, and the administration in northern Cyprus has been set up by the Turkish-Cypriot people in the exercise of its right to self-determination and not by . Notwithstanding this view, it is only the Cypriot government which is recognised internationally as the government of the in the context of diplomatic and treaty relations and the working of international organisations. 16.United Nations peacekeeping forces (“UNFICYP”) maintain a buffer-zone. A number of political initiatives have been taken at the level of the United Nations aimed at settling the problem on the basis of institutional arrangements acceptable to both sides. To this end, inter-communal talks have been sponsored by the Secretary-General of the United Nations acting under the direction of the Security Council. In this connection, the respondent Government maintain that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities in northern have pursued the talks on the basis of what they consider to be already agreed principles of bi-zonality and bi-communality within the framework of a federal constitution. Support for this basis of negotiation is found in the UN Secretary-General's Set of Ideas of 15 July 1992 and the UN Security Council resolutions of 26 August 1992 and 25 November 1992 confirming that a federal solution sought by both sides will be “bi-communal” and “bi-zonal”. Furthermore, and of relevance to the instant application, in 1981 the United Nations Committee on Missing Persons (“CMP”) was set up to “look into cases of persons reported missing in the inter-communal fighting as well as in the events of July 1974 and afterwards” and “to draw up comprehensive lists of missing persons of both communities, specifying as appropriate whether they are still alive or dead, and in the latter case approximate times of death”. The CMP has not yet completed its investigations. 17.The events of July and August 1974 and their aftermath gave rise to three previous applications by the applicant Government against the respondent State under former Article 24 of the Convention. The first (no.6780/74) and second (no. 6950/75) applications were joined by the Commission and led to the adoption on 10 July 1976 of a report under former Article 31 of the Convention (“the 1976 report”) in which the Commission expressed the opinion that the respondent State had violated Articles 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. On 20 January 1979 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in turn adopted, with reference to an earlier decision of 21 October 1977, Resolution DH (79) 1 in which it expressed, inter alia, the conviction that “the enduring protection of human rights in Cyprus can only be brought about through the re-establishment of peace and confidence between the two communities; and that inter-communal talks constitute the appropriate framework for reaching a solution of the dispute”. In its resolution the Committee of Ministers strongly urged the parties to resume the talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in order to agree upon solutions on all aspects of the dispute (see paragraph 16 above). The Committee of Ministers viewed this decision as completing its consideration of the case. The third application (no. 8007/77) lodged by the applicant Government was the subject of a further report under former Article 31 adopted by the Commission on 4 October 1983 (“the 1983 report”). In that report the Commission expressed the opinion that the respondent State was in breach of its obligations under Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. On 2 April 1992 the Committee of Ministers adopted Resolution DH (92) 12 in respect of the Commission's 1983 report. In its resolution the Committee of Ministers limited itself to a decision to make the 1983 report public and stated that its consideration of the case was thereby completed. 18.The instant application is the first to have been referred to the Court. The applicant Government requested the Court in their memorial to “decide and declare that the respondent State is responsible for continuing violations and other violations of Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17 and 18 of the Convention and of Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No. 1”. These allegations were invoked with reference to four broad categories of complaints: alleged violations of the rights of Greek-Cypriot missing persons and their relatives; alleged violations of the home and property rights of displaced persons; alleged violations of the rights of enclaved Greek Cypriots in northern Cyprus; alleged violations of the rights of Turkish Cypriots and the Gypsy community in northern Cyprus. 19.The Court considers it appropriate at this stage to summarise the Commission's findings of fact in respect of the various violations of the Convention alleged by the applicant Government as well as the essential arguments advanced by both parties and the documentary and other evidence relied on by the Commission. 20.The applicant Government essentially claimed in their application that about 1,491 Greek Cypriots were still missing twenty years after the cessation of hostilities. These persons were last seen alive in Turkish custody and their fate has never been accounted for by the respondent State. 21.The respondent Government maintained in reply that there was no proof that any of the missing persons were still alive or were being kept in custody. In their principal submission, the issues raised by the applicant Government should continue to be pursued within the framework of the United Nations Committee on Missing Persons (see paragraph 16 above) rather than under the Convention. 22.The Commission proceeded on the understanding that its task was not to establish what actually happened to the Greek-Cypriot persons who went missing following the Turkish military operations conducted in northern in July and August 1974. Rather, it saw its task as one of determining whether or not the alleged failure of the respondent State to clarify the facts surrounding the disappearances constituted a continuing violation of the Convention. 23.To that end, the Commission had particular regard to its earlier findings in its 1976 and 1983 reports. It recalled that in its 1976 report it had stated that it was widely accepted that a considerable number of Cypriots were still missing as a result of armed conflict in Cyprus and that a number of persons declared to be missing were identified as Greek Cypriots taken prisoner by the Turkish army. This finding, in the Commission's opinion at the time, created a presumption of Turkish responsibility for the fate of persons shown to be in Turkish custody. While noting that killings of Greek-Cypriot civilians had occurred on a large scale, the Commission also considered at the time of its 1976 report that it was unable to ascertain whether, and under what circumstances, Greek-Cypriot prisoners declared to be missing had been deprived of their life. 24.In the present case, the Commission further recalled that in its 1983 report it found it established that there were sufficient indications in an indefinite number of cases that missing Greek Cypriots had been in Turkish custody in 1974 and that this finding once again created a presumption of Turkish responsibility for the fate of these persons. 25.The Commission found that the evidence submitted to it in the instant case confirmed its earlier findings that certain of the missing persons were last seen in Turkish or Turkish-Cypriot custody. In this connection, the Commission had regard to the following: a statement of Mr Denktaş, “President of the TRNC”, broadcast on 1 March 1996, in which he admitted that forty-two Greek-Cypriot prisoners were handed over to Turkish-Cypriot fighters who killed them and that in order to prevent further such killings prisoners were subsequently transferred to Turkey; the broadcast statement of Professor Yalçin Küçük, a former Turkish officer who had served in the Turkish army at the time and participated in the 1974 military operation in Cyprus, in which he suggested that the Turkish army had engaged in widespread killings of, inter alia, civilians in so-called cleaning-up operations; the Dillon Report submitted to the United States Congress in May 1998 indicating, inter alia, that Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot soldiers rounded up Greek-Cypriot civilians in the village of Asha on 18 August 1974 and took away males over the age of 15, most of whom were reportedly killed by Turkish-Cypriot fighters; the written statements of witnesses tending to corroborate the Commission's earlier findings that many persons now missing were taken into custody by Turkish soldiers or Turkish-Cypriot paramilitaries. 26.The Commission concluded that, notwithstanding evidence of the killing of Greek-Cypriot prisoners and civilians, there was no proof that any of the missing persons were killed in circumstances for which the respondent State could be held responsible; nor did the Commission find any evidence to the effect that any of the persons taken into custody were still being detained or kept in servitude by the respondent State. On the other hand, the Commission found it established that the facts surrounding the fate of the missing persons had not been clarified by the authorities and brought to the notice of the victims' relatives. 27.The Commission further concluded that its examination of the applicant Government's complaints in the instant application was not precluded by the ongoing work of the CMP. It noted in this connection that the scope of the investigation being conducted by the CMP was limited to determining whether or not any of the missing persons on its list were dead or alive; nor was the CMP empowered to make findings either on the cause of death or on the issue of responsibility for any deaths so established. Furthermore, the territorial jurisdiction of the CMP was limited to the island of Cyprus, thus excluding investigations in where some of the disappearances were claimed to have occurred. The Commission also observed that persons who might be responsible for violations of the Convention were promised impunity and that it was doubtful whether the CMP's investigation could extend to actions by the Turkish army or Turkish officials on Cypriot territory. 28.The Commission established the facts under this heading against the background of the applicant Government's principal submission that over 211,000 displaced Greek Cypriots and their children continued to be prevented as a matter of policy from returning to their homes in northern and from having access to their property there for any purpose. The applicant Government submitted that the presence of the Turkish army together with “TRNC”-imposed border restrictions ensured that the return of displaced persons was rendered physically impossible and, as a corollary, that their cross-border family visits were gravely impeded. What started as a gradual and continuing process of illegality over the years had now resulted in the transfer of the property left behind by the displaced persons to the “TRNC” authorities without payment of compensation and its re-assignment, together with “title deeds”, to State bodies, Turkish Cypriots and settlers from . 29.The respondent Government maintained before the Commission that the question of the Varosha district of Famagusta along with the issues of freedom of movement, freedom of settlement and the right of property could only be resolved within the framework of the inter-communal talks (see paragraph 16 above) and on the basis of the principles agreed on by both sides for the conduct of the talks. Until an overall solution to the question, acceptable to both sides, was found, and having regard to security considerations, there could be no question of a right of the displaced persons to return. The respondent Government further submitted that the regulation of property abandoned by displaced persons, as with restrictions on cross-border movement, fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the “TRNC” authorities. 30.The Commission found that it was common knowledge that with the exception of a few hundred Maronites living in the Kormakiti area and Greek Cypriots living in the Karpas peninsula, the whole Greek-Cypriot population which before 1974 resided in the northern part of Cyprus had left that area, the large majority of these people now living in southern . The reality of this situation was not contested by the respondent Government. 31.The Commission noted with reference to its earlier findings in its 1976 and 1983 reports that there was no essential change in the situation obtaining at the time of the introduction of the instant application. Accordingly, and this was not disputed either by the respondent Government, displaced Greek Cypriots had no possibility of returning to their homes in northern Cyprus and were physically prevented from crossing into the northern part on account of the fact that it was sealed off by the Turkish army. The arrangements introduced by the “TRNC” authorities in 1998 to allow Greek Cypriots and Maronites to cross into northern for the purposes of family visits or, as regards Greek Cypriots, visits to the Apostolos Andreas Monastery, did not affect this conclusion. 32.Nor did the respondent Government dispute the fact that Greek-Cypriot owners of property in northern continued to be prevented from having access to, controlling, using and enjoying their property. As to the fate of that property, the Commission found it established that up until 1989 there was an administrative practice of the Turkish-Cypriot authorities to leave the official Land Register unaffected and to register separately the “abandoned” property and its allocation. The beneficiaries of allocations were issued with “possessory certificates” but not “deeds of title” to the properties concerned. However, as from June 1989 the practice changed and thereafter “title deeds” were issued and the relevant entries concerning the change of ownership were made in the Land Register. The Commission found it established that, at least since June 1989, the Turkish-Cypriot authorities no longer recognised any ownership rights of Greek Cypriots in respect of their properties in northern . The Commission found confirmation for this finding in the provisions of “Article 159 § 1 (b) of the TRNC Constitution” of 7 May 1985 and “Law no. 52/1995” purporting to give effect to that provision. 33.Although the respondent Government pointed out in their submissions to the Commission that the issue of the right of displaced Greek Cypriots to return to their homes was a matter to be determined within the framework of the inter-communal talks sponsored by the Secretary-General of the United Nations (see paragraph 16 above), the Commission found that there had been no significant progress in recent years in the discussion of issues such as freedom of settlement, payment of compensation to Greek Cypriots for the interference with their property rights, or restitution of Greek-Cypriot property in the Varosha district. 34.The applicant Government adduced evidence in support of their complaint that the dwindling number of Greek Cypriots living in the Karpas peninsula of northern Cyprus were subjected to continuing oppressive treatment which amounted to a complete denial of their rights and a negation of their human dignity. In addition to the harassment and intimidation which they suffered at the hands of Turkish settlers, and which has gone unpunished, the enclaved Greek Cypriots laboured under restrictions which violated many of the substantive rights contained in the Convention. The continuous daily interferences with their rights could not be redressed at the local level on account of the absence of effective remedies before the “TRNC” courts. Similar but less extensive restrictions applied to the Maronite population living in the Kormakiti area of northern . 35.The respondent Government maintained before the Commission that effective judicial remedies were available to all Greek Cypriots living in northern . However, they claimed that the applicant Government actively discouraged them from taking proceedings in the “TRNC”. The respondent Government further submitted that the evidence before the Commission did not provide any basis of fact for the allegations made. 36.The Commission established the facts under this heading with reference to materials submitted by both Governments. These materials included, inter alia, written statements of persons affected by the restrictions alleged by the applicant Government; press reports dealing with the situation in northern Cyprus; case-law of the “TRNC” courts on the availability of remedies in the “TRNC”; “TRNC legislation” and decisions of the “TRNC Council of Ministers” on entry and exit arrangements at the check-point. The Commission also had regard to United Nations documents concerning the living conditions of enclaved Greek Cypriots and especially to the UN Secretary-General's progress reports of 10 December 1995 and 9 March 1998 on the humanitarian review carried out by UNFICYP in 1994-95 concerning the living conditions of Karpas Greek Cypriots, the so-called “Karpas Brief”. 37.Furthermore, the Commission's delegates heard the evidence of fourteen witnesses on the situation of Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in northern . These witnesses comprised two persons who were closely associated with the preparation of the “Karpas Brief” as well as persons proposed by both Governments. The delegates also visited, on 23 and 24 February 1998, a number of localities in northern , including Greek-Cypriot villages in the Karpas area, and heard statements from officials and other persons encountered during the visits. 38.The Commission considered the above-mentioned “Karpas Brief” an accurate description of the situation of the enclaved Greek-Cypriot and Maronite populations at about the time of the introduction of the instant application and that the proposals for remedial action recommended by UNFICYP following the humanitarian review reflected the real needs of these groups in the face of administrative practices which actually existed at the material time. Although the Commission noted that there had been a considerable improvement in the overall situation of the enclaved populations, as evidenced by the UN Secretary-General's progress reports on the “Karpas Brief” recommendations, there still remained a number of severe restrictions. These restrictions were not laid down in any “TRNC legislation” and were in the nature of administrative practices. 39.The Commission further found that there existed a functioning court system in the “TRNC” which was in principle accessible to Greek Cypriots living in northern . It appeared that at least in cases of trespass to property or personal injury there had been some successful actions brought by Greek-Cypriot litigants before the civil and criminal courts. However, in view of the scarcity of cases brought by Greek Cypriots, the Commission was led to conclude that the effectiveness of the judicial system for resident Greek Cypriots had not really been tested. 40.In a further conclusion, the Commission found that there was no evidence of continuing wrongful allocation of properties of resident Greek Cypriots to other persons during the period under consideration. However, the Commission did find it established that there was a continuing practice of the “TRNC” authorities to allocate to Turkish-Cypriots or immigrants the property of Greek Cypriots who had died or left northern . 41.In the absence of legal proceedings before the “TRNC” courts, the Commission noted that it had not been tested whether or not Greek Cypriots or Maronites living in northern were in fact considered as citizens enjoying the protection of the “TRNC Constitution”. It did however find it established that, in so far as the groups at issue complained of administrative practices such as restrictions on their freedom of movement or on family visits which were based on decisions of the “TRNC Council of Ministers”, any legal challenge to these restrictions would be futile given that such decisions were not open to review by the courts. 42.Although the Commission found no evidence of cases of actual detention of members of the enclaved population, it was satisfied that there was clear evidence that restrictions on movement and family visits continued to be applied to Greek Cypriots and Maronites notwithstanding recent improvements. It further observed that an exit visa was still necessary for transfers to medical facilities in the south, although no fees were levied in urgent cases. There was no evidence to confirm the allegation that the processing of applications for movement was delayed in certain cases with the result that the health or life of patients was endangered; nor was there any indication of a deliberate practice of delaying the processing of such applications. 43.The Commission found it established that there were restrictions on the freedom of movement of Greek-Cypriot and Maronite schoolchildren attending schools in the south. Until the entry into force of the decision of the “TRNC Council of Ministers” of 11 February 1998, they were not allowed to return permanently to the north after having attained the age of 16 in the case of males and 18 in the case of females. The age-limit of 16years was still maintained for Greek-Cypriot male students. Up to the age-limit, certain restrictions applied to the visits of students to their parents in the north, which were gradually relaxed. However, even today such visits are subject to a visa requirement and a reduced “entry fee”. 44.As to educational facilities, the Commission held that, although there was a system of primary-school education for the children of Greek Cypriots living in northern , there were no secondary schools for them. The vast majority of schoolchildren went to the south for their secondary education and the restriction on the return of Greek-Cypriot and Maronite schoolchildren to the north after the completion of their studies had led to the separation of many families. Furthermore, school textbooks for use in the Greek-Cypriot primary school were subjected to a “vetting” procedure in the context of confidence-building measures suggested by UNFICYP. The procedure was cumbersome and a relatively high number of school-books were being objected to by the Turkish-Cypriot administration. 45.Aside from school-books, the Commission found no evidence of any restrictions being applied during the period under consideration to the importation, circulation or possession of other types of books; nor was there evidence of restrictions on the circulation of newspapers published in southern . However, there was no regular distribution system for the Greek-Cypriot press in the Karpas area and no direct post and telecommunications links between the north and south of the island. It was further noted that the enclaved population was able to receive Greek-Cypriot radio and television. 46.The Commission did not find any conclusive evidence that letters destined for Greek Cypriots were opened by the “TRNC” police or that their telephones were tapped. 47.As to alleged restrictions on religious worship, the Commission found that the main problem for Greek Cypriots in this connection stemmed from the fact that there was only one priest for the whole Karpas area and that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities were not favourable to the appointment of additional priests from the south. The Commission delegates were unable to confirm during their visit to the Karpas area whether access to the Apostolos Andreas Monastery was free at any time for Karpas Greek Cypriots. It appeared to be the case that on high religious holidays (which occur three times a year) visits to the monastery are also allowed to Greek Cypriots from the south. 48.Concerning alleged restrictions on the freedom of association of the enclaved population, the Commission observed that the relevant “TRNC” law on associations only covered the creation of associations by Turkish Cypriots. 49.The applicant Government contended before the Commission that Turkish Cypriots living in northern , especially political dissidents and the Gypsy community, were the victims of an administrative practice of violation of their Convention rights. They adduced evidence in support of their claim that these groups were victims of arbitrary arrest and detention, police misconduct, discrimination and ill-treatment and interferences in various forms with other Convention rights such as, inter alia, fair trial, private and family life, expression, association, property and education. 50.The respondent Government essentially maintained that the above allegations were unsubstantiated on the evidence and pointed to the availability of effective remedies in the “TRNC” to aggrieved persons. 51.The Commission's investigation into the applicant Government's allegations was based mainly on the oral evidence of thirteen witnesses who testified before the Commission's delegates on the situation of Turkish Cypriots and the Gypsy community living in northern . The witnesses were proposed by both parties. Their evidence was taken by the delegates in Strasbourg, Cyprus and between November 1997 and April 1998. 52.The Commission found that there existed rivalry and social conflict between the original Turkish Cypriots and immigrants from who continued to arrive in considerable numbers. Some of the original Turkish Cypriots and their political groups and media resented the “TRNC” policy of full integration for the settlers. 53.Furthermore, while there was a significant incidence of emigration from the “TRNC” for economic reasons, it could not be excluded that there were also cases of Turkish Cypriots having fled the “TRNC” out of fear of political persecution. The Commission considered that there was no reason to doubt the correctness of witnesses' assertions that in a few cases complaints of harassment or discrimination by private groups of or against political opponents were not followed up by the “TRNC” police. However, it concluded that it was not established beyond reasonable doubt that there was in fact a consistent administrative practice of the “TRNC” authorities, including the courts, of refusing protection to political opponents of the ruling parties. In so far as it was alleged by the applicant Government that the authorities themselves were involved in the harassment of political opponents, the Commission did not have sufficient details concerning the incidents complained of (for example, the dispersing of demonstrations, short-term arrests) which would allow it to form an opinion as to the justification or otherwise of the impugned acts. The Commission noted that, in any event, it did not appear that the remedy of habeas corpus had been invoked by persons claiming to be victims of arbitrary arrest or detention. 54.Regarding the alleged discrimination against and arbitrary treatment of members of the Turkish-Cypriot Gypsy community, the Commission found that judicial remedies had apparently not been used in respect of particularly grave incidents such as the pulling down of shacks near Morphou and the refusal of airline companies to transport Gypsies to the United Kingdom without a visa. 55.In a further conclusion, the Commission observed that there was no evidence before it of Turkish-Cypriot civilians having been subjected to the jurisdiction of military courts during the period under consideration. Furthermore, and with respect to the evidence before it, the Commission considered that it had not been established that, during the period under consideration, there was an official prohibition on the circulation of Greek-language newspapers in northern or that the creation of bi-communal associations was prevented. In respect of the alleged refusal of the “TRNC” authorities to allow Turkish Cypriots to return to their properties in southern , the Commission observed that no concrete instances were referred to it of any persons who had wished to do so during the period under consideration.",2001,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT REJECTS THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT'S CRITICISM IN THIS RESPECT.
112.  THE COURT ALSO OBSERVES THAT IN ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE IN RELATION TO THE VARIOUS COMPLAINTS DECLARED ADMISSIBLE, THE COMMISSION APPLIED THE STANDARD OF PROOF “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” AS ENUNCIATED BY THE COURT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT OF 18 JANUARY 1978 (SERIES A NO. 25), IT BEING NOTED THAT SUCH PROOF MAY FOLLOW FROM THE COEXISTENCE OF SUFFICIENTLY STRONG, CLEAR AND CONCORDANT INFERENCES OR OF SIMILAR UNREBUTTED PRESUMPTIONS OF FACT (IBID., PP. 64-65, § 161).
113.  THE COURT, FOR ITS PART, ENDORSES THE APPLICATION OF THIS STANDARD, ALL THE MORE SO SINCE IT WAS FIRST ARTICULATED IN THE CONTEXT OF A PREVIOUS INTERSTATE CASE AND HAS, SINCE THE DATE OF THE ADOPTION OF THE JUDGMENT IN THAT CASE, BECOME PART OF THE COURT'S ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW (FOR A RECENT EXAMPLE, SEE SALMAN V. TURKEY [GC], NO. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000-VII).
MOREOVER, AS REGARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE EXISTENCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES, THE COURT DOES NOT RELY ON THE CONCEPT THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS BORNE BY ONE OR THE OTHER OF THE TWO GOVERNMENTS CONCERNED. RATHER, IT MUST EXAMINE ALL THE MATERIAL BEFORE IT, IRRESPECTIVE OF ITS ORIGIN (SEE THE ABOVE-MENTIONED IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, P. 64 § 160).
114.  THE COURT NOTES, HOWEVER, THAT THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT HAVE DISPUTED THE APPROPRIATENESS OF APPLYING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED STANDARD OF PROOF WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ALLEGATIONS THAT THE VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION OF WHICH THEY COMPLAIN RESULT FROM ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES ON THE PART OF THE RESPONDENT STATE. IN THEIR SUBMISSION, THE COMMISSION ERRED IN NOT HAVING REGARD TO THE EXISTENCE OF “SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE” OF ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES AND ITS RELIANCE ON THE “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” STANDARD PREVENTED IT FROM REACHING THE CORRECT CONCLUSION ON THE FACTS AS REGARDS A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS. FOR THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT, THE STANDARD OF PROOF APPLIED BY THE COMMISSION IS AT VARIANCE WITH THE APPROACH FOLLOWED BY THE COURT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, AN APPROACH WHICH, THEY MAINTAIN, HAD ALREADY BEEN ANTICIPATED IN THE COMMISSION'S DECISION IN THE “GREEK CASE” (YEARBOOK 12).
115.  THE COURT RECALLS HOWEVER THAT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, IT REJECTED THE IRISH GOVERNMENT'S SUBMISSION THAT THE “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” STANDARD OF PROOF WAS AN EXCESSIVELY RIGID STANDARD FOR ESTABLISHING THE EXISTENCE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE OF VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION (LOC. CIT., PP. 64-65, § 161). THE “BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT” STANDARD WAS APPLIED IN THAT CASE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EVIDENCE BORE OUT THE ALLEGATION OF A PRACTICE OF VIOLATION. THE COURT WILL ACCORDINGLY ASSESS THE FACTS AS FOUND BY THE COMMISSION WITH REFERENCE TO THIS STANDARD. FURTHERMORE, THE COURT WILL APPLY THE DEFINITION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CONVENTION SET OUT IN ITS IRELAND V. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT, NAMELY AN ACCUMULATION OF IDENTICAL OR ANALOGOUS BREACHES WHICH ARE SUFFICIENTLY NUMEROUS AND INTER-CONNECTED TO AMOUNT NOT MERELY TO ISOLATED INCIDENTS OR EXCEPTIONS BUT TO A PATTERN OR SYSTEM (IBID., P. 64, § 159).
116.  THE COURT FURTHER RECALLS THAT, IN THE AREA OF THE EXHAUSTION OF DOMESTIC REMEDIES, THERE IS A DISTRIBUTION OF THE BURDEN OF PROOF. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INSTANT CASE, IT IS INCUMBENT ON THE RESPONDENT GOVERNMENT CLAIMING NON-EXHAUSTION TO SATISFY THE COURT THAT THE REMEDY WAS AN EFFECTIVE ONE AVAILABLE IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE AT THE RELEVANT TIME, THAT IS TO SAY, THAT IT WAS ACCESSIBLE, WAS ONE WHICH WAS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING REDRESS IN RESPECT OF THE AGGRIEVED INDIVIDUALS' COMPLAINTS AND OFFERED REASONABLE PROSPECTS OF SUCCESS. HOWEVER, ONCE THIS BURDEN OF PROOF HAS BEEN SATISFIED IT FALLS TO THE APPLICANT GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH THAT THE REMEDY ADVANCED BY THE RESPONDENT GOVERNMENT WAS IN FACT EXHAUSTED OR WAS FOR SOME REASON INADEQUATE AND INEFFECTIVE IN THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE, OR THAT THERE EXISTED SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ABSOLVING THE PERSONS CONCERNED FROM THE REQUIREMENT OF EXHAUSTING THAT REMEDY. ONE SUCH REASON MAY BE CONSTITUTED BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES REMAINING TOTALLY PASSIVE IN THE FACE OF SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT OR INFLICTION OF HARM BY STATE AGENTS, FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THEY HAVE FAILED TO UNDERTAKE INVESTIGATIONS OR OFFER ASSISTANCE. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IT CAN BE SAID THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF SHIFTS ONCE AGAIN, SO THAT IT BECOMES INCUMBENT ON THE RESPONDENT GOVERNMENT TO SHOW WHAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE "
19,001-58226,Grand Chamber,"7.Mr Pélissier was born in 1944 and lives at Sanary-sur-Mer; Mr Sassi was born in 1935 and lives at . Both are French nationals.>On 16 October 1975 Mr Fernand Cortez and Mr Claude Cortez formed a private limited company (société à responsabilité limitée – Sàrl), Bleu Marine, whose object was the sale of pleasure craft. Fernand Cortez was appointed manager. In 1976 Bleu Marine started to trade with a public company, Chantiers Beneteau S.A., whose object was boat-building. On 8October 1981, Bleu Marine became Chantiers Beneteau’s exclusive distributor for the Var département coast.>On 31 March 1980 both applicants became shareholders in Bleu Marine, each holding 250 of a total of 1,000 shares (the remaining 500 belonged to the promoters, Fernand and Claude Cortez). 10.On 29 September 1982 Fernand Cortez, the applicants and MrDominique Stizi formed a private limited company, Station Service du Bateau Sàrl, which was run by Fernand Cortez and Dominique Stizi. Its objects were the development of port infrastructures, harbour building and the sale and outfitting of boats. The share capital was held by FernandCortez (48 shares), the applicants (24 shares), and Dominique Stizi (104shares). On 29 February 1984 the declared the company insolvent and ordered its judicial reorganisation. 11.By agreements made with Station Service du Bateau and another company, Cortez et Cie, Bleu Marine was granted a licence allowing it to launch its boats on the sea front. 12.In 1983 relations between Bleu Marine and Chantiers Beneteau started to deteriorate, the former owing the latter nearly three million French francs (FRF). Chantiers Beneteau then terminated the distribution agreement with Bleu Marine. 13.On 30 May 1983 Bleu Marine filed for insolvency. On 1 June 1983 the held that the company was insolvent and ordered its judicial reorganisation. 14.On 4 July 1984 the , finding that Bleu Marine had debts of almost FRF 10 million, ordered its liquidation under the supervision of the court. 15.On 20 June 1983 Chantiers Beneteau lodged a complaint with the senior investigating judge against a person or persons unknown for forgery of commercial documents and fraud by the falsification of a balance sheet and its use with a view to obtaining a rescheduling of debt which would never be honoured. On 16 December 1983 the investigating judge sent instructions to the Marseilles Regional Police Department. 16.On 27 June 1984 Fernand Cortez, the manager of Bleu Marine, was charged by the investigating judge assigned to the case. On 8October an additional charge of negligent and fraudulent bankruptcy was brought against him. On 22 January 1985 the investigating judge’s instructions of 16 December 1983 were carried out. The results revealed in particular the existence of a property holding company (société civile immobilière), SCI Le Ponant, which had been set up by Fernand Cortez, MrPélissier and Mr Sassi’s wife, in order to acquire land for letting to Bleu Marine. 17.On 15 October 1984 Mr and Mrs Grouzet lodged a complaint against Fernand Cortez and any other person having managerial responsibility for Bleu Marine, alleging misappropriation and, subsequently, fraud, in connection with the purchase and payment for a boat that was never delivered. On 4 October 1985 a Mr Louis Dreyer lodged a complaint against Fernand Cortez for misappropriation and applied to be joined to the proceedings as a civil party claiming damages. 18.On 14 September 1984, after appearing before the investigating judge on 20 and 21 August and 13 September 1984, the first applicant was charged with the offences set out in the complaint of 20 June 1983 and with negligent and fraudulent bankruptcy and misappropriation. 19.On 12 June 1985 the second applicant was charged with the same offences. 20.After Law no. 85-98 of 25 January 1985, which reformed insolvency law, came into force, the public prosecutor, considering there to be “strong evidence of criminal bankruptcy”, lodged an additional application to have Fernand Cortez, Dominique Stizi and the applicants charged with that offence under the new law. In so doing, he relied on the provisions relating to criminal bankruptcy and aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy. 21.In a letter of 14 November 1985 to the investigating judge, the lawyer acting for Chantiers Beneteau argued that a charge of aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy might lie against the applicants. On 17 July 1986 Chantiers Beneteau applied to be joined to the criminal bankruptcy proceedings as a civil party claiming damages. 22.On 1 December 1986 the investigating judge preferred an additional charge of “criminal bankruptcy” against Fernand Cortez under sections 196 and 197 of the Law of 25 January 1985 and Articles 402 and 403 of the Criminal Code. On 4, 16 and 19 December 1986 he preferred identical additional charges of “criminal bankruptcy” against the first applicant, the second applicant and Dominique Stizi respectively. 23.On 15 June 1987 the investigating judge appointed two accounting experts to audit the accounts. 24.On 30 June 1988 they submitted their report to the investigating judge. 25.On 10 January 1989 the investigating judge made an order transmitting the file to the public prosecutor for submissions (ordonnance de soit-communiqué). 26.On 27 June 1990 the investigating judge made a discharge order on the charges of forgery and using forged commercial documents, negligent and fraudulent bankruptcy and fraud; ultimately, the only charge on which the applicants were committed to stand trial at the Criminal Court was that of criminal bankruptcy under the Law of 25 January 1985. A discharge order was also made in the case of Fernand Cortez on the same charges and on the complaint lodged by Mr and Mrs Grouzet. He was committed to stand trial at the Criminal Court alone (on certain charges for which he was the sole defendant), with Dominique Stizi (on charges relating to the management of Station Service du Bateau), and with the applicants. In his order, the investigating judge cited Articles 402, 406 and 408 of the Criminal Code and sections 196 and 197 of the Law of 25 January 1985. 27.On 12 March 1991 the Toulon Criminal Court sentenced Fernand Cortez to one year’s imprisonment and a fine of FRF 20,000 for fraudulent bankruptcy, concealment of assets and misappropriation. It acquitted Dominique Stizi of the charges against him. Of the civil parties, Chantiers Beneteau’s application to be joined to the criminal bankruptcy proceedings was declared inadmissible and the court noted that Mr and Mrs Grouzet had withdrawn their application to be joined as civil parties; the only person to be awarded compensation was Louis Dreyer (in respect of the misappropriation by Fernand Cortez). 28.In the same judgment, the Toulon Criminal Court held with regard to the bankruptcy charges against the applicants: “It should firstly be noted that under the Law only de jure or de facto managers, not, as suggested by the prosecution, members, can commit the offence. Without it being necessary to consider whether the indictment is bad for failure to allege that the members [the applicants] were de facto managers, that being an essential element of the offence, it need only be observed that [the applicants] have not performed any acts of management, the de jure manager cannot be regarded as having been a ‘replaceable’, compliant manager and it does not appear that he gave the other two the right to sign on his behalf. ... Thus, as they cannot properly be described as de jure managers, the defendants Sassi and Pélissier must be acquitted of these offences.” 29.On 14 March 1991 Chantiers Beneteau appealed against that judgment. The public prosecutor and Fernand Cortez did likewise on 22March 1991. On 2 April 1992 Chantiers Beneteau lodged additional submissions with the registry of the Court of Appeal in which they proposed, in the alternative, recharacterising the acts the applicants were alleged to have committed as “aiding and abetting” criminal bankruptcy. 30.On 26 November 1992, after hearings on 16 April and 25 June 1992, the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal held that although the applicants could not be regarded as having been de facto managers of the company, they had nonetheless been informed of the serious difficulties it was in and had “wilfully performed positive, material acts that had facilitated, aided or abetted Cortez in the concealment of assets to the detriment of Bleu Marine”. It appears from the judgment that the applicants were regarded as appearing before the Court of Appeal as “defendants on criminal bankruptcy charges”. 31.The Court of Appeal consequently held that the applicants were guilty, not of the offences charged, but of the separate offence of aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy through the concealment of assets. As regards the first applicant in particular, the Court of Appeal found, inter alia, that he had furnished a false certificate in order to justify the payment of a sum of money in a suspect operation. It referred in its judgment to Chantiers Beneteau’s main submissions requesting the applicants’ conviction for criminal bankruptcy, but made no mention of the additional submissions lodged on 2 April 1992 concerning the accusation that they had aided and abetted criminal bankruptcy. There is a dispute as to whether that request was brought to the attention of the applicants; however, it is common ground that it was mentioned, as an ancillary point, by the civil party at the hearing. 32.The Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal sentenced each of the applicants to a suspended term of eighteen months’ imprisonment and to a fine of FRF 30,000. While upholding the conviction of Fernand Cortez and the partial discharge order made in his favour by the Toulon Criminal Court, it nonetheless increased the term of imprisonment to eighteen months, while suspending it, and the fine to FRF 30,000. Lastly, the Court of Appeal upheld Dominique Stizi’s acquittal, the award of damages to Louis Dreyer and the declaration that Chantiers Beneteau’s application to be joined as a civil party was inadmissible. 33.On 26 and 27 November 1992 the applicants appealed against that decision to the Court of Cassation on points of law. In their pleadings they denied the offence and contended on the basis of Article 6 of the Convention that the Court of Appeal’s decision to convict them of an offence different from that charged had not been the subject of adversarial argument and had infringed the rights of the defence. In addition, the first applicant submitted that when referring to alleged irregularities on his account the Court of Appeal had relied on allegations that had never been put to him and were incapable of showing that he had aided and abetted criminal bankruptcy. 34.In a judgment of 14 February 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants’ appeal on the grounds that: “... the reasons given in the impugned judgment enable the Court of Cassation to satisfy itself that the court below sufficiently made out, within the limits of its jurisdiction, all the constitutive elements of the actus reus and mens rea of both the principal offence of criminal bankruptcy committed by Fernand Cortez through the concealment of assets and the offence committed by Philippe Sassi and FrançoisPélissier of aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy through the concealment of assets. The grounds of appeal, which merely contest the findings which the court below, in its unfettered discretion, came to on the facts and circumstances of the case after hearing the parties’ submissions, cannot be upheld.” 35.The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide: Article 388 “The Criminal Court shall be seised of offences within its jurisdiction on the voluntary appearance of the parties, a summons accompanied by a statement of the charges, an immediate summary trial or, lastly, a committal by the investigating judge or judges.” Article 509 “The case is transferred to the Court of Appeal to the extent determined in the notice of appeal ...” 36.The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code in force at the material time were as follows: Article 59 “Accessories to a serious crime (crime) or other major offence (délit) shall be liable to the same penalties as the principals, except where statute provides otherwise.” Article 60 “A person who, by gifts, promises, threats, abuse of authority or power, scheming or contrivance, has incited the commission of a serious crime (crime) or other major offence (délit) or given instructions for its commission; has procured weapons, implements or any other means of assisting in the commission of an offence knowing that such weapons, implements or other means were intended for that purpose; or has knowingly aided or abetted the principal or principals in acts preparatory to the commission of the offence or facilitating its commission or in carrying out the offence, shall be guilty of an offence as accessories, without prejudice to the penalties specially imposed by this Code on persons conspiring to commit or inciting breaches of State security, even if the crime intended by those conspiring or inciting is not committed.” Article 402 “Persons found guilty of criminal bankruptcy shall be liable on conviction to between three months’ and five years’ imprisonment and a fine of between FRF10,000 and FRF 200,000 or to either of those penalties. In addition, an order may be made barring them from exercising the rights referred to in Article 42.” Article 403 “Accessories to criminal bankruptcy shall be liable to the same penalties as those laid down in the preceding Article, even if they are not merchants, craftsmen or farmers and do not directly or indirectly, de facto or de jure, manage a private-law legal entity having an economic activity.” 37.The relevant provisions of this law read as follows: Section 196 “The provisions of this Chapter are applicable to: (1)all traders and craftsmen; (2)anyone who has directly or indirectly, whether de jure or de facto, managed or liquidated a private-law entity having an economic activity; and (3)individuals who are permanent representatives of entities managing entities as defined in subsection 2 above.” Section 197 “Where judicial reorganisation proceedings are commenced, the persons referred to in section 196 shall be guilty of criminal bankruptcy if they are found to have done any of the following: (1)with the intention of avoiding or delaying the commencement of judicial reorganisation proceedings, made purchases with a view to resale at less than market value or used ruinous means to procure funding; (2)misappropriated or concealed all or part of the debtor’s assets; (3)fraudulently increased the debtor’s liabilities; or (4)held fictitious accounts or caused accounting documents of the undertaking or entity to disappear or failed to keep any accounts.”",1999,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY

55,001-108072,Grand Chamber,"9.The first applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Brighton. The facts which gave rise to his application are as follows. 10.While working as a consultant physician in the field of rehabilitative medicine, the first applicant was charged on two counts of indecent assault on two female patients while they were allegedly under hypnosis. The first count in the indictment alleged that he had indecently assaulted a woman called S.T. during a consultation on 3 June 2003. The second count in the indictment alleged that he had indecently assaulted a woman called V.U. also during a consultation, this time on 12 June 2003. 11.For reasons unrelated to the alleged assault, S.T. committed suicide before the trial. However, several months after the alleged assault, she had made a statement to the police. She had also told two friends, B.F. and S.H., that the applicant had indecently assaulted her. 11.For reasons unrelated to the alleged assault, S.T. committed suicide before the trial. However, several months after the alleged assault, she had made a statement to the police. She had also told two friends, B.F. and S.H., that the applicant had indecently assaulted her. 12.On 22 March 2004 a preliminary hearing was held to determine whether S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury. At that hearing, the defence indicated that the defence to each count of the indictment was essentially the same, namely that S.T. and V.U.’s allegations were wholly untrue. The judge at the hearing decided that S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury at trial. He observed that the first applicant was very likely to feel that he had no realistic alternative other than to give evidence in order to defend himself on the second count relating to V.U. Therefore, the reading of S.T.’s statement would not have the effect of making it very difficult for the applicant not to give evidence. The judge also noted that collusion between S.T. and V.U. was not alleged, and so that issue did not need to be investigated by cross-examination of each woman. 12.On 22 March 2004 a preliminary hearing was held to determine whether S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury. At that hearing, the defence indicated that the defence to each count of the indictment was essentially the same, namely that S.T. and V.U.’s allegations were wholly untrue. The judge at the hearing decided that S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury at trial.

The judge also noted that collusion between S.T. and V.U. was not alleged, and so that issue did not need to be investigated by cross-examination of each woman. 13.Having regard to the contents of S.T.’s statement, the judge also observed that it was crucial to the prosecution on count one as there was no other direct evidence of what took place during the consultation on 3 June 2003. He said: “[P]utting it bluntly, no statement, no count one.” He went on to observe that the real issue was whether it was likely to be possible for the first applicant to controvert the statement in a way that achieved fairness to the defendant. The judge found that the first applicant could give evidence as to what had happened during the consultation. It was also the intention of the prosecution to call S.T.’s friends to give evidence as to what she had said to them. There were inconsistencies between their statements and S.T.’s, which provided a route by which S.T.’s statement could be challenged. An expert witness would also be called by the prosecution to give evidence on altered perception during hypnosis and cross-examination of that witness might also serve to undermine S.T.’s credibility. 14.At the trial, once S.T.’s statement had been read, the jury heard evidence from B.F. and S.H., S.T.’s friends. S.T.’s general practitioner also gave evidence as to a letter he had written on S.T.’s behalf to the hospital authorities, which outlined S.T.’s allegations against the first applicant. In respect of the second count, the indecent assault upon V.U., evidence was given by V.U. and by the police officers who had investigated the case. Evidence was then given by two women who alleged that the first applicant had made improper suggestions to them during hypnosis consultations. That evidence was relied on by the prosecution as “similar fact evidence” to support the evidence of S.T. and V.U. As the prosecution had indicated, expert evidence was given as to the effects of hypnosis. The defence was given the opportunity to cross-examine all the witnesses who gave live evidence. The first applicant gave evidence in his own defence. He also called a number of witnesses, who gave evidence as to his good character. 14.At the trial, once S.T.’s statement had been read, the jury heard evidence from B.F. and S.H., S.T.’s friends.

The first applicant gave evidence in his own defence. He also called a number of witnesses, who gave evidence as to his good character. 15.In his summing up, the trial judge directed the jury, on two separate occasions, as to how they should regard S.T.’s statement. Firstly, he stated: “It is very important that you [the jury] bear in mind when considering her [S.T.’s] evidence that you have not seen her give evidence; you have not heard her give evidence; and you have not heard her evidence tested in cross-examination [by counsel for Mr Al-Khawaja], who would, undoubtedly, have had a number of questions to put to her.” “It is very important that you [the jury] bear in mind when considering her [S.T.’s] evidence that you have not seen her give evidence; you have not heard her give evidence; and you have not heard her evidence tested in cross-examination [by counsel for Mr Al-Khawaja], who would, undoubtedly, have had a number of questions to put to her.” 16.He later stated: “... bear in mind ... that this evidence was read to you. The allegation is completely denied ... you must take that into account when considering her evidence.” “... bear in mind ... that this evidence was read to you. The allegation is completely denied ... you must take that into account when considering her evidence.” 17.When referring to the evidence of S.T.’s friends, the trial judge reminded the jury that there was an inconsistency between S.T.’s account of the consultation and the account given by S.H. (in her statement S.T. said that the applicant had touched her face and mouth; S.H. gave evidence that it was S.T. herself and not the first applicant who had touched her face and mouth). The trial judge continued: “It is for you to decide the extent to which the evidence of [B.F.] and [S.H.] helps you in deciding whether or not [S.T.] has spoken the truth in her statement. But bear in mind the evidence as to what [S.T.] said to [B.F.] and [S.H.] is not independent evidence as to the truth of her allegations.” “It is for you to decide the extent to which the evidence of [B.F.] and [S.H.] helps you in deciding whether or not [S.T.] has spoken the truth in her statement. But bear in mind the evidence as to what [S.T.] said to [B.F.] and [S.H.] is not independent evidence as to the truth of her allegations.” 18.The trial judge also instructed the jury that they were entitled to consider the evidence of V.U., and of the other two women who had given evidence as to the improper suggestions made by the first applicant, when deciding whether S.T.’s statement was true. However, the jury firstly had to discount the possibility of collusion between the four women. Secondly, they had to ask themselves whether it was reasonable that four people independently making similar accusations could all either be lying or mistaken or have all suffered similar hallucinations or false memory. If the jury thought that incredible, they could be satisfied that S.T. and V.U. had spoken the truth. The trial judge also directed the jury that the greater the similarity between the allegations, the greater the likelihood that the four women were telling the truth. He added that the jury also had to consider whether the women could have consciously or unconsciously been influenced by hearing of the complaints of the others. 19.In the course of their deliberations, on two occasions the jury asked for clarification of points raised in the statement of S.T. On 30 November 2004, the first applicant was convicted by a unanimous verdict of the jury on both counts of indecent assault. He was sentenced to a fifteen-month custodial sentence on the first count and a twelve-month custodial sentence on the second count, to run consecutively. 20.The first applicant appealed against his conviction to the Court of Appeal. The appeal centred on the pre-trial ruling to admit S.T.’s statement as evidence. It was also submitted that, in his summing up, the trial judge did not give adequate directions to the jury as to the consequential disadvantage of this evidence to the first applicant. 21.The appeal was heard and dismissed on 6 September 2005. In its written judgment handed down on 3 November 2005 the Court of Appeal concluded that the first applicant’s right to a fair trial had not been infringed. With regard to the admission in evidence of the statement of S.T., the court held that it was not necessarily incompatible with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention. Relying on Doorson v. the Netherlands (26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II), the court held that the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter of domestic law. It then found: “25.The important factors in the present case are the following. The witness, S.T., could not be examined on behalf of the [first applicant] because she had died. She was the only witness whose evidence went directly to the commission of an indecent assault on her by the appellant. If her statement had been excluded, the prosecution would have had to abandon the first count. The [applicant] was able to attack the accuracy of [S.T.’s] statement by exploring the inconsistencies between it and the witnesses, [B.F.] and [S.H.], and through the expert evidence relating to ‘altered perception’ under hypnosis. The relevant sections of the 1988 Act [see paragraph 41 below] contained provisions designed to protect defendants, which were properly considered by the judge, before the statement was admitted in evidence. Lastly, the tribunal of fact, here the jury, could and should take proper account of the difficulties which the admission of a statement might provide for the [applicant], which should be provided by an appropriate direction to the jury. 26.Where a witness who is the sole witness of a crime has made a statement to be used in its prosecution and has since died, there may be a strong public interest in the admission of the statement in evidence so that the prosecution may proceed. That was the case here. That public interest must not be allowed to override the requirement that the defendant have a fair trial. Like the court in Sellick [see paragraph 48 below] we do not consider that the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights requires the conclusion that in such circumstances the trial will be unfair. The provision in Article 6 § 3 (d) that a person charged shall be able to [have] the witnesses against him examined is one specific aspect of a fair trial: but if the opportunity is not provided, the question is ‘whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way the evidence was taken, were fair’ – Doorson, paragraph 19 [see paragraph 58 below]. This was not a case where the witness had absented himself, whether through fear or otherwise, or had required anonymity, or had exercised a right to keep silent. The reason was death, which has a finality which brings in considerations of its own, as has been indicated at the start of this paragraph.” 26.Where a witness who is the sole witness of a crime has made a statement to be used in its prosecution and has since died, there may be a strong public interest in the admission of the statement in evidence so that the prosecution may proceed.

The reason was death, which has a finality which brings in considerations of its own, as has been indicated at the start of this paragraph.” 22.Turning to the issue of the trial judge’s summing up, the court stated: “We consider that it would have been better if the judge had stated explicitly that the [first applicant] was potentially disadvantaged by the absence of [S.T.] and that in consequence of the inability to cross-examine her and of the jury to see her, her evidence should carry less weight with them. Nonetheless, in the circumstances of this case it must have been wholly clear to the jury from the directions the judge did give, that this was the purpose of his remarks. We therefore consider that the jury were given an adequate direction as to the consequences of [S.T.’s] statement being in evidence in her absence, and that this is not a factor which might make the [first applicant’s] trial unfair and in breach of Article 6. We should also say that overall the evidence against the [first applicant] was very strong. We were wholly unpersuaded that the verdicts were unsafe.” 23.The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords but certified that a point of law of general public importance was involved in the decision. 24.On 30 November 2005 the first applicant petitioned the House of Lords on the point of law certified by the Court of Appeal. On 7 February 2006 the House of Lords refused the petition. 25.The second applicant was born in 1975. His application arises from his conviction for wounding with intent. The background to that conviction is as follows. 26.On 19 May 2004, S., a member of the Iranian community living in London, was involved in an altercation with some Kurdish men. The second applicant interposed himself between S. and the Kurdish men in order to protect S. In the small hours of the morning of 20 May 2004, S. and the second applicant met again outside an Iranian restaurant in Hammersmith, . The second applicant asked S to have a word with him and led him into a nearby alleyway. The men began discussing the earlier altercation. Although S. denied throwing the first punch, he conceded while giving evidence at the second applicant’s trial that he had punched the second applicant. In the fight, the second applicant pushed S. back and, at this stage, S. became aware of a burning sensation in his back, which proved to be the result of three stab wounds to his back. S. and the second applicant had been face-to-face and S.’s account was that he neither saw the second applicant stab him, nor was he aware of the second applicant going behind him or reaching round his back, so as to stab him. 27.During the fight other men were present, including the Kurdish men from the earlier altercation. A friend of S., another member of the Iranian community called T., was there, as were two of T.’s friends and the second applicant’s uncle. S could not say which of the men were behind him. 28.S. saw a knife lying on the ground and he realised that he had been stabbed. In his evidence at the second applicant’s trial (see paragraph 32 below), he stated that he went to pick it up but that either the second applicant or T. had picked it up and thrown it towards the restaurant. S. assumed that it had been the second applicant who had stabbed him. According to S., the second applicant immediately denied this. He told S. to sit down beside him and attempted to staunch the blood flow from S.’s wounds until an ambulance arrived; when it did, he accompanied S to the hospital. At the hospital, the second applicant told the police that he had seen two black men stab S. 29.When witnesses were questioned at the scene, no one claimed to have seen the second applicant stab S. Two days later, however, T. made a statement to the police that he had seen the second applicant stab S. In his statement, T. recounted that, when the second applicant and S. had begun fighting in the alleyway, T. had tried to separate them. He then saw the second applicant hold S. by the neck, hold up the knife and stab S. twice in the back. As T. moved towards the second applicant, the second applicant tried to stab T. in the neck. According to T., the second applicant then dropped the knife and shouted “don’t tell the police”. 29.When witnesses were questioned at the scene, no one claimed to have seen the second applicant stab S. Two days later, however, T. made a statement to the police that he had seen the second applicant stab S. In his statement, T. recounted that, when the second applicant and S. had begun fighting in the alleyway, T. had tried to separate them. He then saw the second applicant hold S. by the neck, hold up the knife and stab S. twice in the back. As T. moved towards the second applicant, the second applicant tried to stab T. in the neck. According to T., the second applicant then dropped the knife and shouted “don’t tell the police”. 30.On 3 November 2004 the second applicant was arrested and taken to Hammersmith police station. In interview, he denied stabbing S. and again stated that two black men were responsible. He was charged with wounding with intent and also with attempting to pervert the course of justice for telling the police, at the hospital and at the police station, that he had seen two black men stab S. 31.On 25 April 2005 the second applicant’s trial began at Blackfriars Crown Court. That day, he pleaded guilty in respect of the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice but maintained his not guilty plea in respect of the charge of wounding with intent. 31.On 25 April 2005 the second applicant’s trial began at Blackfriars Crown Court. That day, he pleaded guilty in respect of the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice but maintained his not guilty plea in respect of the charge of wounding with intent. 32.S. gave evidence for the prosecution. He recounted how he and the second applicant had fought in the alleyway. After a minute he realised that he had been injured in the back. He had not seen who stabbed him. The second applicant had made him sit down and had covered the wound. S. had asked the second applicant who had stabbed him and the second applicant had denied that it was him. When cross-examined, S. accepted that he had not seen the second applicant go behind him and that they had been face-to-face. He also testified that he had heard someone shout to him “Tell him it was the blacks”; the voice did not belong to the second applicant. 33.After S had given evidence, the prosecution made an application for leave to read T.’s statement pursuant to section 116(2)(e) and (4) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”; see paragraphs 43-45 below). The prosecution argued under the 2003 Act that T. was too fearful to attend trial before the jury and that he should qualify for special measures. The trial judge heard evidence from a police officer conducting the case who testified that the Iranian community was close-knit and that T.’s fear was genuine. T.also gave evidence to the trial judge (but not the jury) from behind a screen. He told the judge that he was in fear for himself and his family because of visits and telephone calls he had received, none of which were said to have been from the second applicant. He did not say who had been responsible for the visits and telephone calls. 34.In ruling that leave should be given for the statement to be read to the jury, the trial judge stated: “I am satisfied in those circumstances upon the criminal standard of proof that this witness is genuinely in fear; and I base that not only on his oral testimony, but also upon my opportunity while he was in the witness box to observe him. I therefore have to go on to consider the questions posed in [section 116(4) of the 2003 Act]. Subsection 4(a) requires me to look at the statement’s contents. I have done so. It is submitted by the defence that they may be unreliable; there being some inconsistencies with the evidence that was given by [S.]. There will always be cases, whether it be oral evidence or evidence that is read, where there are inconsistencies. It is always for the jury to come to a conclusion, based upon submissions of counsel and the evidence that they have heard, as to whether the evidence is reliable or not. And they will receive from me the appropriate warning when the time comes as to how they should view that statement. It is further submitted that in looking at the statement, it is a statement of great importance; in that it is from a person who purports to witness the incident and consequently goes to the heart of the matter. In my view, it is precisely this type of witness who is likely to be put in fear, and consequently that must have been what Parliament had in mind when it enacted this particular section. I therefore have to look, having looked at the contents of the statement, to any risk its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to any party to the proceedings. I am satisfied that there would be an unfairness caused by its exclusion; but I am equally satisfied that no unfairness would be caused by its admission. And in doing so, I have taken into account the words of [the 2003 Act]; in particular how difficult it will be to challenge the statement if the relevant person does not give oral evidence. Challenge of a statement does not always come from cross-examination. Challenge of a statement can be caused by evidence given in rebuttal; by either the defendant, if he chooses to do so, or by any other bystander – and we know that there were some – who were on the street at that time. Consequently I am satisfied that the defendant’s evidence, if he chooses to give it, would be sufficient to rebut and to challenge the evidence that is contained in that statement. I have further considered other relevant factors, and I have also offered to the witness whilst he was in the witness box behind screens the possibility of him giving evidence with the same special measures in place. He told me his position would not change; that he could not give evidence before a jury, and the reason that he could not was because he was in fear. Having taken all those matters into account in those circumstances, I am satisfied that this is the type of case which Parliament envisaged might require a statement to be read.” 35.T.’s witness statement was then read to the jury. Evidence was also given by the doctor who had treated S. at hospital as to the nature of the wound and by a forensic scientist who had tested the blood found on the second applicant’s clothes and confirmed it matched that of S. (though no firm conclusions could be drawn as to how it had been deposited on the clothes). The record of the second applicant’s interview by the police was also tendered by the prosecution (see paragraph 30 above). 36.The second applicant gave evidence in his defence. He stated that he had been present at the earlier altercation with the Kurdish men. When he and S. later met outside the restaurant, he had taken S. by the hand and suggested that they go and talk, but S. had begun to punch him. He had defended himself by grabbing S. by the collar and pushing him. T. had then tried to intervene and a number of other members of the Iranian community had restrained S. T. had been standing between S. and the second applicant and, at this stage, the second applicant noticed the knife on the ground. He had picked it up and thrown it, not knowing at this point that S. had been stabbed. When S blamed him for the stabbing, the second applicant had told him to sit down and had successfully calmed him down. He placed his hand on the wound on S.’s back. S. then appeared to accept that the second applicant had not stabbed him. The second applicant also gave evidence that he had told the police that two black men were responsible because this was what his uncle had told him to say. Finally, the second applicant gave evidence that, before he had been interviewed by the police, T. had told him that he, T., knew that the second applicant had not stabbed S. 36.The second applicant gave evidence in his defence.

Finally, the second applicant gave evidence that, before he had been interviewed by the police, T. had told him that he, T., knew that the second applicant had not stabbed S. 37.The judge, in his summing up, warned the jury about the danger of relying on the evidence of T. He stated: “That evidence, as you know, was read to you under the provisions that allow a witness who is frightened, it is not a question of nerves it is a question of fright, fear, for his statement to be read to you but you must be careful as to how you treat it. It is right, as has been pointed out by the defence, that they were deprived of an opportunity to test that evidence under cross-examination. It is right also that you did not have the advantage of seeing the witness and his demeanour in court. You did not have the opportunity for him to think back and say ‘possibly because of things I saw I put two and two together and made five’, as counsel for the defence invites you to say. In other words, you must always be alert to [the fact] that he could put things that he did see together and come to the wrong conclusion. That is a way of examining the statement. You must ask yourselves ‘can we rely upon this statement? Is it a statement which we find convincing?’ It is only, if you are satisfied so that you are sure, that what is in the statement has accurately depicted what happened that night and what the witness saw, that you could rely upon it. That goes for any witness. It is only if you find that the evidence is compelling and satisfies you, so that you are sure, that you act upon it. So you must always ask yourselves ‘is the statement he made reliable?’ You must bear in mind also, importantly, that it is agreed and acknowledged that it is not the defendant who is responsible for putting the witness in fear.” 38.On 29 April 2005 the second applicant was convicted by a majority verdict of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, for which he was later sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with a term of fifteen months’ imprisonment for the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice to which he had pleaded guilty. 39.The second applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the inability to cross-examine T. infringed his right to a fair trial. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the Crown accepted that T.’s statement was “both important and probative of a major issue in the case ... had it not been admitted the prospect of a conviction would have receded and that of an acquittal advanced”. The court upheld the reasoning of the trial judge, stating that there was available not only cross-examination of other prosecution witnesses but also evidence from the second applicant himself and the potential for evidence from other bystanders in order to prevent unfairness. It was also stated that the trial judge had explicitly warned the jury in detail as to how they should treat this evidence and properly directed them as to how they should consider it in reaching their verdict. Although the second applicant maintained that even a proper direction by the judge could not cure the unfairness, the Court of Appeal held that the jury was informed of all matters necessary to its decision-making process. Leave to appeal on conviction was refused on 24 January 2006. The Court of Appeal did, however, give the second applicant leave to appeal against his sentence and reduced the sentence of nine years’ imprisonment to seven years’ imprisonment. 40.Hearsay evidence is any statement of fact other than one made, of his own knowledge, by a witness in the course of oral testimony (see paragraph20 of the judgment of Lord Phillips in R. v. Horncastle and others, summarised at paragraphs 57 to 62 below). As a general rule it is inadmissible in a criminal case unless there is a common-law rule or statutory provision which allows for its admission. The relevant statutory provisions applicable to each applicant are set in the following section. Those statutory provisions are supplemented by three common-law principles. Firstly, there is an additional discretion at common law for a trial judge to exclude any evidence if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. This, in turn, is supplemented by section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which provides the court with a discretion to exclude evidence if its admission would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the trial that it ought not to be admitted. Secondly, if hearsay evidence is admitted and the jury have heard it, the trial judge, in his summing up, must direct the jury as to the dangers of relying on hearsay evidence. Thirdly, in a jury trial, the jury must receive the traditional direction as to the burden of proof, namely that they must be satisfied of the defendant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.>Primary legislation applicable in Mr Al-Khawaja’s case 41.At the time of the first applicant’s trial, the relevant statutory provisions were to be found in sections 23 to 28 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”). Section 23 of the 1988 Act provides for the admission of first-hand documentary hearsay in a criminal trial: “23. ... a statement made by a person in a document shall be admissible in criminal proceedings as evidence of any fact of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible if— (2)... (a)... the person who made the statement is dead or by reason of his bodily or mental condition unfit to attend as a witness; ... 25.(1)If, having regard to all the circumstances— (a)the Crown Court— (i)on a trial on indictment; (ii)on an appeal from a magistrates’ court; or (iii)on the hearing of an application under section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 (applications for dismissal of charges of fraud transferred from magistrates’ court to Crown Court); or (b)the criminal division of the Court of Appeal; or (c)a magistrates’ court on a trial of an information, is of the opinion that in the interests of justice a statement which is admissible by virtue of section 23 or 24 above nevertheless ought not to be admitted, it may direct that the statement shall not be admitted. (2)Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) above, it shall be the duty of the court to have regard— (a)to the nature and source of the document containing the statement and to whether or not, having regard to its nature and source and to any other circumstances that appear to the court to be relevant, it is likely that the document is authentic; (b)to the extent to which the statement appears to supply evidence which would otherwise not be readily available; (c)to the relevance of the evidence that it appears to supply to any issue which is likely to have to be determined in the proceedings; and (d)to any risk, having regard in particular to whether it is likely to be possible to controvert the statement if the person making it does not attend to give oral evidence in the proceedings, that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to the accused or, if there is more than one, to any of them. 26.Where a statement which is admissible in criminal proceedings by virtue of section 23 or 24 above appears to the court to have been prepared ..., for the purposes— (a)of pending or contemplated criminal proceedings; or (b)of a criminal investigation, the statement shall not be given in evidence in any criminal proceedings without the leave of the court, and the court shall not give leave unless it is of the opinion that the statement ought to be admitted in the interests of justice; and in considering whether its admission would be in the interests of justice, it shall be the duty of the court to have regard— (i)to the contents of the statement; (ii)to any risk, having regard in particular to whether it is likely to be possible to controvert the statement if the person making it does not attend to give oral evidence in the proceedings, that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to the accused or, if there is more than one, to any of them; and (iii)to any other circumstances that appear to the court to be relevant ...” Schedule 2 to the Act allows for the admission of evidence relating to the credibility and consistency of the maker of the statement, where such evidence would have been admissible had he or she given evidence in person, or where the matter could have been put to him or her in cross-examination. The Schedule also provides that, in estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to such a statement regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to its accuracy or otherwise.>Primary legislation applicable in Mr Tahery’s case (a)The Law Commission’s report 42.In its report of April 1997, entitled “Evidence in Criminal Proceedings: Hearsay and Related Topics”, the Law Commission recommended a series of reforms to the law of hearsay in England and Wales, including the provisions contained in the 1988 Act. In addition to recommending clarification of the conditions under which a witness statement could be admitted at trial (including the existing grounds of death and fear), the Commission proposed that there should be a limited discretion to admit hearsay evidence that did not fall within any other statutory or common-law exception (recommendation 28). In its earlier consultation paper, published in January 1995, the Commission had reviewed the case-law of this Court on Article 6 § 3 (d) and concluded that there was a risk of a breach of the Convention where a person stood to be convicted on hearsay evidence alone. The Commission considered that this risk was sufficiently serious to warrant requiring the trial court to stop the case where hearsay is the only evidence of an element of the offence (paragraph 9.5 of the consultation paper). After criticisms of this proposal (principally that it was unduly cautious and was beset with practical difficulties), in its 1997 report the Commission decided not to maintain its proposal (see paragraphs 5.33-5.41 of the report). It concluded instead that the adequate protection would be provided by the safeguards it proposed, in particular its recommendation 47, which proposed giving the trial judge the power to stop a case if hearsay evidence was unconvincing (see paragraph 45 below). (b)The Criminal Justice Act 2003 (b)The Criminal Justice Act 2003 43.Part 11, Chapter 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”) came into force in April 2005. It was intended to reform substantially the law governing the admission of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings on the basis of the draft bill proposed by the Law Commission. Under section 114 of the 2003 Act, hearsay evidence is only admissible in criminal proceedings if one of a number of “gateways” applies. Although it was not relied upon in the second applicant’s case, one such “gateway” is section 114(1)(d) which allows for the admission of hearsay evidence if the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice for it to be admissible. Section114(2) provides: “In deciding whether a statement not made in oral evidence should be admitted under subsection (1)(d), the court must have regard to the following factors (and to any others it considers relevant)— (a)how much probative value the statement has (assuming it to be true) in relation to a matter in issue in the proceedings, or how valuable it is for the understanding of other evidence in the case; (b)what other evidence has been, or can be, given on the matter or evidence mentioned in paragraph (a); (c)how important the matter or evidence mentioned in paragraph (a) is in the context of the case as a whole; (d)the circumstances in which the statement was made; (e)how reliable the maker of the statement appears to be; (f)how reliable the evidence of the making of the statement appears to be; (g)whether oral evidence of the matter stated can be given and, if not, why it cannot; (h)the amount of difficulty involved in challenging the statement; (i)the extent to which that difficulty would be likely to prejudice the party facing it.” (i)the extent to which that difficulty would be likely to prejudice the party facing it.” 44.The “gateway” relied on in the second applicant’s case was section116, which allows for the admission of statements of absent witnesses. Section 116, where relevant, provides: “(1)In criminal proceedings a statement not made in oral evidence in the proceedings is admissible as evidence of any matter stated if— (a)oral evidence given in the proceedings by the person who made the statement would be admissible as evidence of that matter; (b)the person who made the statement (the relevant person) is identified to the court’s satisfaction; and (c)any of the five conditions mentioned in subsection (2) is satisfied. (2)The conditions are— (a)that the relevant person is dead; (b)that the relevant person is unfit to be a witness because of his bodily or mental condition; (c)that the relevant person is outside the and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance; (d)that the relevant person cannot be found although such steps as it is reasonably practicable to take to find him have been taken; (e)that through fear the relevant person does not give (or does not continue to give) oral evidence in the proceedings, either at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement, and the court gives leave for the statement to be given in evidence. (3)For the purposes of subsection (2)(e) ‘fear’ is to be widely construed and (for example) includes fear of the death or injury of another person or of financial loss. (4)Leave may be given under subsection (2)(e) only if the court considers that the statement ought to be admitted in the interests of justice, having regard— (a)to the statement’s contents; (b)to any risk that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to any party to the proceedings (and in particular to how difficult it will be to challenge the statement if the relevant person does not give oral evidence); (c)in appropriate cases, to the fact that a direction under section 19 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 (c. 23) (special measures for the giving of evidence by fearful witnesses etc.) could be made in relation to the relevant person; and (d)to any other relevant circumstances. (5)A condition set out in any paragraph of subsection (2) which is in fact satisfied is to be treated as not satisfied if it is shown that the circumstances described in that paragraph are caused— (a)by the person in support of whose case it is sought to give the statement in evidence; or (b)by a person acting on his behalf; in order to prevent the relevant person giving oral evidence in the proceedings (whether at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement).” in order to prevent the relevant person giving oral evidence in the proceedings (whether at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement).” 45.By section 121 of the 2003 Act, section 116(2)(e) can only be relied upon in respect of first-hand hearsay; it cannot be relied only to allow the admission of multiple hearsay. In addition, section 124 allows the admission of evidence to challenge the credibility of the absent witness, for example through the admission of evidence of his bad character, including previous convictions, a propensity to be untruthful and so on. It also allows the admission of inconsistent statements that the witness has made. Section 124(2) allows the admission of evidence to challenge the credibility of the absent witness in circumstances where it would not be admissible in respect of a live witness, for example when it relates to a collateral issue in the case. Where a case is based wholly or partly on hearsay evidence, section 125 requires the trial judge to stop the case (and either direct an acquittal or discharge the jury) if, considering its importance to the case against the defendant, the hearsay evidence is so unconvincing that a conviction would be unsafe. This enacted the Law Commission’s recommendation 47 (see paragraph 42 above). Section 126 preserves both the common-law discretion and the section 78 discretion of the trial judge to exclude hearsay evidence (see paragraph 40 above). It also provides a statutory discretion to exclude hearsay evidence if the trial judge is satisfied that “the case for excluding it, taking account of the danger that to admit it would result in undue waste of time, substantially outweighs the case for admitting it, taking account of the value of the evidence”.>The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 46.The conditions under which witnesses can give evidence anonymously in criminal proceedings are now regulated by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (“the 2009 Act”). Formerly, this was regulated by similar provisions in the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008, which was enacted following the House of Lords’ judgment in R. v. Davis (see paragraphs 49 and 50 below). Under the 2009 Act, witnesses can only give evidence anonymously when, upon the application of either the prosecution or a defendant in the proceedings, the trial judge makes a “witness anonymity order”. Section 87 requires that the trial judge be informed of the identity of the witness. Sections 88(2)-(6) and 89 lay down the conditions for the making of a witness anonymity order. In deciding whether those conditions are met, the court must have regard, inter alia, to whether evidence given by the witness might be the sole or decisive evidence implicating the defendant (section 89(2)(c)). 47.Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen. Section 6(1) provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.>R. v. Sellick and Sellick 48.This Court’s judgment in Lucà v. Italy (no. 33354/96, § 40, ECHR 2001II) was considered by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Sellick and Sellick [2005] EWCA Crim 651, which concerned two defendants who were alleged to have intimidated witnesses. Leave was given by the trial judge to have the witnesses’ statements read to the jury. The defendants appealed on the ground that the admission of the statements breached Article 6 § 1 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d). The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. In considering the relevant case-law of this Court, at paragraph 50 of its judgment, it stated that what appeared from that case-law were the following propositions: “(i)The admissibility of evidence is primarily for the national law; (ii)Evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing and as a general rule Article [6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] require a defendant to be given a proper and adequate opportunity to challenge and question witnesses; (iii)It is not necessarily incompatible with Article [6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] for depositions to be read and that can be so even if there has been no opportunity to question the witness at any stage of the proceedings. Article [6 § 3 (d)] is simply an illustration of matters to be taken into account in considering whether a fair trial has been held. The reasons for the court holding it necessary that statements should be read and the procedures to counterbalance any handicap to the defence will all be relevant to the issue, whether, where statements have been read, the trial was fair; (iv)The quality of the evidence and its inherent reliability, plus the degree of caution exercised in relation to reliance on it, will also be relevant to the question whether the trial was fair.” The Court of Appeal then stated: “The question is whether there is a fifth proposition to the effect that where the circumstances justify the reading of the statement where the defendant has had no opportunity to question the witness at any stage of the trial process, the statement must not be allowed to be read if it is the sole or decisive evidence against the defendant. Certainly at first sight paragraph 40 of Lucà seems to suggest that in whatever circumstances and whatever counterbalancing factors are present if statements are read then there will be a breach of Article 6, if the statements are the sole or decisive evidence. Furthermore there is some support for that position in the previous authorities. But neither Lucà nor any of the other authorities were concerned with a case where a witness, whose identity was well-known to a defendant, was being kept away by fear, although we must accept that the reference to Mafia-type organisations and the trials thereof in paragraph 40 shows that the court had extreme circumstances in mind.”>R. v.>R. v. 49.In R. v. Davis [2008] UKHL 36, the House of Lords considered an appeal against conviction by a defendant who had been convicted of two counts of murder by shooting. Three witnesses had given evidence at trial identifying the defendant as the gunman. They gave evidence anonymously, testifying behind a screen so that they could be seen by the judge and jury but not the defendant. The House of Lords unanimously allowed the defendant’s appeal. It found that the witnesses’ testimony was inconsistent with the long-established principle of the English common law that, subject to certain exceptions and statutory qualifications, the defendant in a criminal trial should be confronted by his accusers in order that he may cross-examine them and challenge their evidence, a principle which originated in ancient (Lord Bingham at paragraph 5). Moreover, this Court had not set its face absolutely against the admission of anonymous evidence in all circumstances. However, it had said that a conviction should not be based solely or to a decisive extent on anonymous statements. In any event, on the facts in Davis’s case, this Court would have found a violation of Article 6: not only was the anonymous witnesses’ evidence the sole or decisive basis on which Davis had been convicted, but effective cross-examination had been hampered. Moreover, this Court had not set its face absolutely against the admission of anonymous evidence in all circumstances. However, it had said that a conviction should not be based solely or to a decisive extent on anonymous statements. In any event, on the facts in Davis’s case, this Court would have found a violation of Article 6: not only was the anonymous witnesses’ evidence the sole or decisive basis on which Davis had been convicted, but effective cross-examination had been hampered. 50.Lord Mance, concurring in judgment, considered the relevant authorities of this Court on Article 6. Having done so, he doubted that there was an absolute requirement that anonymous testimony should not be the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant. Instead, the extent to which such testimony is decisive might be no more than a very important factor to balance in the scales. He also considered that R. v. Sellick and Sellick (among other authorities) served as a caution against treating the Convention, or apparently general statements by this Court, as containing absolutely inflexible rules. 51.The Chamber judgment of 20 January 2009 in the present cases was considered by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in R. v. Horncastle and others. The case concerned the appeals of four defendants who had been convicted on the basis of statements of absent victims, which were read at trial under section 116 of the 2003 Act. For two of the defendants, the maker of the statement had died. For another two, the witness was too fearful to attend trial. Their appeals were heard together with that of a fifth defendant, Carter, who had been convicted on the basis of business records, which were introduced at his trial. 52.On 22 May 2009 the Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appeals of the first four defendants ([2009] EWCA Crim 964). It accepted that Article 6 § 3 (d) had a content of its own but, given that it did not create any absolute right to have every witness examined, the balance struck by the 2003 Act was legitimate and wholly consistent with the Convention. There could be a very real disadvantage in admitting hearsay evidence and it needed cautious handling. However, having regard to the safeguards contained in the 2003 Act, which were rigorously applied, there would be no violation of Article 6 if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive degree on hearsay evidence. Where the hearsay evidence was demonstrably reliable, or its reliability could properly be tested and assessed, the rights of the defence would be respected, there would be sufficient counterbalancing measures and the trial would be fair. It was not appropriate that there should be a rule that counterbalancing measures could never be sufficient where the evidence was sole or decisive. This had been considered and rejected by the Law Commission and Parliament when it enacted the 2003 Act. 52.On 22 May 2009 the Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appeals of the first four defendants ([2009] EWCA Crim 964).

This had been considered and rejected by the Law Commission and Parliament when it enacted the 2003 Act. 53.There were also principled and practical difficulties with a sole or decisive rule. Firstly, as a principled difficulty, the test assumed that all hearsay evidence was unreliable in the absence of testing in open court, and secondly, it further assumed that the fact-finder (such as the jury) could not be trusted to assess the weight of the evidence. Neither assumption was justified. For the first, the Court of Appeal gave examples of hearsay evidence that would be reliable such as a victim who, before dying, revealed the name of his or her murderer. For the second, the Court of Appeal found that juries were perfectly able to understand the limitations of written statements and, under section 124 of the 2003 Act, would be provided with material about the maker of the statement (see paragraph 45 above). The mere fact that the evidence was an essential link in the chain of evidence against the accused did not alter that conclusion. For example, forensic evidence might depend on work done by unidentified laboratory assistants (and to that extent was hearsay). However, it was not necessary for every member of the laboratory who had worked with the evidence to be called in order for the strength of the evidence to be tested. 53.There were also principled and practical difficulties with a sole or decisive rule.

For example, forensic evidence might depend on work done by unidentified laboratory assistants (and to that extent was hearsay). However, it was not necessary for every member of the laboratory who had worked with the evidence to be called in order for the strength of the evidence to be tested. 54.The court also found that there were practical difficulties with the sole or decisive rule as a test of admissibility of evidence. It observed: “It is clear from the judgment in Al-Khawaja [v. the United Kingdom] that the [European Court of Human Rights] took the view that the error had lain in admitting the hearsay evidence: see in particular paragraphs 37, 40, 42 and 46. Any test of admissibility must be one which can be applied in advance of the giving of the evidence, let alone of the outcome of the trial. A routine test of admissibility of evidence which can only be applied in retrospect, after the outcome of the trial is known, makes the trial process little more than speculative. Judge, jury, witnesses and parties may find themselves engaged in shadow-boxing without knowing whether the solemn result of the trial will stand to be reversed on the grounds that, as things have turned out, the test of admissibility was not met. Nor can any defendant decide how to conduct his case, and indeed whether or not to plead guilty, if he does not know what evidence can and cannot be relied upon. It will no doubt often be possible to identify in advance a case in which the hearsay evidence in question is the sole evidence against the accused. An obvious case is that of the single eyewitness case, with no suggested support from any other source. But this frequently may not be clear from the outset; there may be other evidence which the prosecution intends to present, but which, on hearing, turns out not to incriminate the accused, or is effectively demolished. Conversely, what appears at the outset to be hearsay evidence standing alone may sometimes come to be supported by other material as the evidence develops. A witness may add something of great significance not previously mentioned, or the significance of something always said may become apparent when apparently unconnected other evidence is given. In any case where there is more than one accused jointly charged, it is common experience that the evidence of one may well shed enormous light upon the guilt or innocence of another. So even the concept of ‘sole’ evidence is an impractical test for admissibility. It is, however, the second limb of the suggested test which is apt to cause the greatest difficulty. No one can know what evidence is decisive until the decisionmaking process is over. On no view can it be possible to rule in advance, at the stage when admissibility is in question, which evidence will be decisive ... The application of the test is made the more difficult yet if the meaning of ‘decisive’ is extended to encompass any evidence of which it can be said that, if it were absent, ‘the prospect of a conviction would have receded and that of an acquittal advanced’ (see paragraph 21 of Al-Khawaja). Indeed, if that is the test of what is decisive, virtually all evidence would qualify; evidence which does not, if accepted by the jury, advance the prospect of conviction will ordinarily be excluded as irrelevant.” The Court of Appeal also observed that the test would also be impossible to apply at a trial of two or more defendants, where one defendant sought to introduce hearsay evidence for his defence. In such a case, the trial judge would be bound to allow the defendant to introduce that evidence even if it might also incriminate one of the other defendants and indeed be decisive evidence against that other defendant. The Court of Appeal also observed that the test would also be impossible to apply at a trial of two or more defendants, where one defendant sought to introduce hearsay evidence for his defence. In such a case, the trial judge would be bound to allow the defendant to introduce that evidence even if it might also incriminate one of the other defendants and indeed be decisive evidence against that other defendant. 55.The Court of Appeal also considered that the safeguard in section125 of the 2003 Act (the power of a trial judge to stop the case if the hearsay evidence is unconvincing; see paragraph 45 above) provided for a “proportionate assessment of the reliability” of hearsay evidence and it would not serve justice if that power were to be trammelled by a requirement that it be exercised in every case in which the hearsay evidence were the sole or decisive evidence. Sole or decisive hearsay could be wholly convincing and, equally, evidence which was neither sole nor decisive might have such a potential influence on the jury that the judge would be persuaded that a conviction was unsafe. Where there was a legitimate argument that that hearsay was unconvincing and important to the case, the trial judge was required to make up his own mind as to whether a conviction would be safe; this involved assessing the reliability of the hearsay evidence, its place in the evidence as a whole, the issues in the case as they had emerged, and all the other individual circumstances of the case. Finally, the other safeguards contained in the 2003 Act were rigorously applied and the difficulties faced by defendants when hearsay was admitted were well understood by the courts. The Act did not equate hearsay with first-hand evidence; on the contrary it required cautious handling. 55.The Court of Appeal also considered that the safeguard in section125 of the 2003 Act (the power of a trial judge to stop the case if the hearsay evidence is unconvincing; see paragraph 45 above) provided for a “proportionate assessment of the reliability” of hearsay evidence and it would not serve justice if that power were to be trammelled by a requirement that it be exercised in every case in which the hearsay evidence were the sole or decisive evidence.

Finally, the other safeguards contained in the 2003 Act were rigorously applied and the difficulties faced by defendants when hearsay was admitted were well understood by the courts. The Act did not equate hearsay with first-hand evidence; on the contrary it required cautious handling. 56.The Court of Appeal also gave guidance as to assessing when it would be appropriate to allow hearsay evidence to be introduced because a witness was in fear. There was, in the case-law of this Court, no requirement that the fear had to be attributable to the defendant, and the essential questions were whether there was a justifiable reason for the absence of the witness supported by evidence and whether the evidence was demonstrably reliable or its reliability could be properly tested and assessed. The Court of Appeal added: “It is, however, important that all possible efforts are made to get the witness to court. As is clear, the right to confrontation is a long-standing requirement of the common law and recognised in Article 6 [§ 3 (d)]. It is only to be departed from in the limited circumstances and under the conditions set out in the [2003 Act]. The witness must be given all possible support, but also made to understand the importance of the citizen’s duty, and indeed that the violent and intimidatory will only flourish the more if that duty is not done, whilst they will normally back down in the face of determination that it be performed. For this reason it is of especial importance that assurances are never given to potential witnesses that their evidence will be read. Unless the defendant consents, it is only the court applying the strict conditions of the [2003 Act] based on evidence that can admit such a statement. Any indication, let alone an assurance, can only give rise to an expectation that this will indeed happen, when if it does the impact of the evidence will be diminished and the disadvantage to the accused may result in it not being given at all. It may well be that in the early stage of police enquiries into a prominent crime the investigators need to seek out information on a confidential basis: that is a matter for practical policing and not for us. But no person who is becoming not simply a source of information but a witness should be told that his evidence will be read, or indeed given any indication whatsoever that this is likely. The most that he can be told is that witnesses are expected to be seen at court, that any departure from that principle is exceptional, and that the decision whether to depart from it is one for the judge and not for the police. In the case before us of Marquis and Graham [two of the appellants], as we set out at paragraphs 127 and 132, the judge found that the investigating police officer had significantly contributed to the fear of the witness by referring repeatedly to a notorious local example of witnesses being hunted down, although relocated, and killed. Although notorious, that incident was an extreme and very unusual case. The need for police officers to tender careful advice to potential witnesses in order to discharge their duty of care towards them should not lead to such frightening information being laboured out of defensiveness. Whilst the [2003 Act] requires fear to be construed broadly, it is not to be expected that fear based upon inappropriate assurances by police officers will result in the evidence being read and the case proceeding on the basis of it to the jury. If the evidence can really only be assessed by the jury by seeing the witness, as will often be the case, it may not be admitted. If it is admitted and central to the case, there is a significant possibility that at the end of the trial the judge may have to rule under [section] 125 that a conviction relying upon it would be unsafe.” (b)The judgment of the Supreme Court 57.On 9 December 2009 the United Kingdom Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment ([2009] UKSC 14). Lord Phillips, giving the judgment of the Supreme Court, found that, although domestic courts were required by the Human Rights Act 1998 to take account of the Strasbourg jurisprudence in applying principles that were clearly established, on rare occasions, where a court was concerned that the Strasbourg judgment did not sufficiently appreciate or accommodate some aspect of English law, it might decline to follow the judgment. The Chamber judgment was such a case. 57.On 9 December 2009 the United Kingdom Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment ([2009] UKSC 14). Lord Phillips, giving the judgment of the Supreme Court, found that, although domestic courts were required by the Human Rights Act 1998 to take account of the Strasbourg jurisprudence in applying principles that were clearly established, on rare occasions, where a court was concerned that the Strasbourg judgment did not sufficiently appreciate or accommodate some aspect of English law, it might decline to follow the judgment. The Chamber judgment was such a case. 58.Lord Phillips considered that a defendant should not be immune from conviction where a witness, who had given critical and apparently reliable evidence in a statement, was unavailable to give evidence at trial through death or some other reason. In analysing the relevant case-law of this Court on Article 6 § 3 (d), Lord Phillips concluded that, although this Court had recognised the need for exceptions to the strict application of Article 6 § 3 (d), the manner in which it approved those exceptions resulted in a jurisprudence which lacked clarity. The sole or decisive rule had been introduced into the Strasbourg case-law in Doorson (cited above) without discussion of the underlying principle or full consideration of whether there was justification for imposing the rule as an overriding principle applicable equally to continental and common-law jurisdictions. Indeed, the rule seemed to have been created because, in contrast to the common law, continental systems of criminal procedure did not have a comparable body of jurisprudence or rules governing the admissibility of evidence. 59.Lord Phillips, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, found that the rule would create severe practical difficulties if applied to English criminal procedure. Firstly, it was not easy to apply because it was not clear what was meant by “decisive”: under English criminal procedure no evidence could be admitted unless it was potentially probative and, in theory, any item of probative evidence could make the difference between conviction and acquittal. Secondly, it would be hard enough to apply that test at first instance but it would be impossible for national appellate courts or this Court to decide whether a particular statement was the sole or decisive basis for a conviction. In a jury trial, the only way the rule could be applied would be to exclude all hearsay evidence. 59.Lord Phillips, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, found that the rule would create severe practical difficulties if applied to English criminal procedure. Firstly, it was not easy to apply because it was not clear what was meant by “decisive”: under English criminal procedure no evidence could be admitted unless it was potentially probative and, in theory, any item of probative evidence could make the difference between conviction and acquittal.

In a jury trial, the only way the rule could be applied would be to exclude all hearsay evidence. 60.Lord Phillips also observed: “The sole or decisive test produces a paradox. It permits the court to have regard to evidence if the support that it gives to the prosecution case is peripheral, but not where it is decisive. The more cogent the evidence the less it can be relied upon. There will be many cases where the statement of a witness who cannot be called to testify will not be safe or satisfactory as the basis for a conviction. There will, however, be some cases where the evidence in question is demonstrably reliable. The Court of Appeal has given a number of examples. I will just give one, which is a variant of one of theirs. A visitor to witnesses a hit and run road accident in which a cyclist is killed. He memorises the number of the car, and makes a statement to the police in which he includes not merely the number, but the make and colour of the car and the fact that the driver was a man with a beard. He then returns to his own country, where he is himself killed in a road accident. The police find that the car with the registration number that he provided is the make and colour that he reported and that it is owned by a man with a beard. The owner declines to answer questions as to his whereabouts at the time of the accident. It seems hard to justify a rule that would preclude the conviction of the owner of the car on the basis of the statement of the deceased witness, yet that is the effect of the sole or decisive test.” 61.Lord Phillips instead concluded that the 2003 Act made such a rule unnecessary in English criminal procedure because, if the 2003 Act were observed, there would be no breach of Article 6 § 3 (d) even if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive extent on hearsay evidence. To demonstrate this point, Annex 4 to the judgment analysed a series of cases against other Contracting States where this Court had found a violation of Article 6 § 1 when taken in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d). In each case, had the trial taken place in England and Wales, the witness’s testimony would not have been admissible under the 2003 Act either because the witness was anonymous and absent or because the trial court had not made sufficient enquiries to ensure there was good reason for the witness’s absence. Alternatively, had the evidence been admitted, any conviction would have been quashed on appeal. 61.Lord Phillips instead concluded that the 2003 Act made such a rule unnecessary in English criminal procedure because, if the 2003 Act were observed, there would be no breach of Article 6 § 3 (d) even if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive extent on hearsay evidence.

Alternatively, had the evidence been admitted, any conviction would have been quashed on appeal. 62.Lord Brown delivered a concurring judgment in which he stated: “These appeals are of the utmost importance. If the Strasbourg case-law does indeed establish an inflexible, unqualified principle that any conviction based solely or decisively on evidence adduced from an absent or anonymous witness is necessarily to be condemned as unfair and set aside as contrary to [Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] of the Convention, then the whole domestic scheme for ensuring fair trials – the scheme now enshrined (as to hearsay evidence) in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and (as to anonymous evidence) in the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008 [see paragraph 46 above] – cannot stand and many guilty defendants will have to go free. It is difficult to suppose that the has in fact laid down so absolute a principle as this and, indeed, one exception to it, at least, appears to be acknowledged: the fairness of admitting hearsay evidence from a witness absent as a result of the defendant’s own intimidation. ... Nor can readily be supposed to have intended the sort of practical problems and anomalies identified by the Court of Appeal (paragraphs 61-63 and6871 [of its judgment]) that must inevitably flow from any absolute principle of the kind here contended for. Obviously, the more crucial the evidence is to the proof of guilt, the more scrupulous must the court be to ensure that it can be fairly adduced and is likely to be reliable. In this connection there can be no harm in using the concept of ‘sole or decisive’ so long as it is used broadly – as it is in the 2008 Act with regard to anonymous witnesses and, indeed, in the control order context where it relates rather to the allegations made against the suspect than the evidence adduced in support. Understood and applied inflexibly, however, the concept would involve insoluble problems of detailed interpretation and application. The better view may therefore be that no such absolute principle emerges from the Strasbourg Court’s judgment in Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom ...” 63.Subject to certain statutory exceptions, in Scots criminal law a person cannot be convicted of a crime or statutory offence on the uncorroborated testimony of one witness, however credible (see Morton v. HM Advocate 1938 JC 52, quoted in Campbell v. HM Advocate 2004SLT135). 64.Hearsay is regulated by section 259 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which allows for its admissibility under certain conditions, including when the person who made the statement is dead. Section 259(4) permits evidence to be admitted which is relevant to the credibility of the person as a witness. In N v. HM Advocate 2003 SLT 761 the High Court of Justiciary, sitting as an appeal court, reluctantly reached the conclusion that section 259 deprived the court of the discretion it previously enjoyed at common law to exclude such evidence if it was unreliable. Lord Justice Clerk observed that, notwithstanding section 259, the long-recognised dangers in hearsay evidence remained. He added: “Where a general provision such as [section] 259 applies, there are bound to be cases in the circumstances of which hearsay evidence would be so prejudicial to the fairness of the trial that the only just and proper course would be to exclude it. This, I think, is such a case. I am not impressed by the three safeguards to which the trial judge referred (HMAdvocate v. N, at p. 437C–E). The requirement of corroboration is a neutral consideration. It is a safeguard that applies to prosecution evidence in any form. I cannot see what worthwhile safeguard the principle of corroboration provides if the primary evidence sought to be corroborated is per se unfair to the accused. Moreover, the leading of evidence bearing upon the credibility of the maker of the hearsay statement may be at most an exercise in damage limitation where clearly prejudicial evidence has already been led. As for the safeguard of the judge’s directions, I think that there may be cases where the hearsay evidence is so prejudicial that no direction, however strong, could make adequate amends for the unfairness of its having been admitted. ... In English provisions governing the admissibility of a statement made in a document, Parliament has expressly conferred a discretion on the court to exclude such a statement if it is of the opinion that in the interests of justice it ought not to be admitted. One specific consideration to which the court must have regard is the risk that the admission of the evidence will result in unfairness to the accused (Criminal Justice Act 1988, [sections] 25(1), 25(2)(d) and 26(ii); cf. R. v. Gokal). These, in my view, are prudent provisions. If provisions of this kind had been available to the trial judge in this case, they could have enabled him to exclude the hearsay at the outset.” 65.The High Court of Justiciary also considered the compatibility of the introduction of the evidence of an absent witness with Article 6 § 3 (d) in McKenna v. HM Advocate. In that case, a murder trial, the prosecution sought to introduce statements made to the police by a possible co-accused who had since died. In a previous ruling given before trial (2000 SLT 508), the High Court of Justiciary, sitting as an appeal court, had found that it was only in extreme circumstances that an accused could contend in advance of trial that the introduction of the hearsay evidence would be so prejudicial to the prospects of a fair trial that the court could determine the issue in advance. It therefore allowed the trial to proceed. When the statements were introduced at trial and the accused was convicted, he appealed against his conviction. In its judgment dismissing the appeal (2003 SLT 508), the High Court of Justiciary found that, while the statements were important evidence, having regard to the other evidence led at trial (which included admissions by the accused and forensic evidence), it could not be said that the appellant’s conviction was based to a decisive extent on them. The jury had also been adequately and satisfactorily directed as to how to approach the absent witness’s statement. A similar conclusion was reached by the same court in HM Advocate v. M 2003 SLT 1151. 65.The High Court of Justiciary also considered the compatibility of the introduction of the evidence of an absent witness with Article 6 § 3 (d) in McKenna v. HM Advocate.

The jury had also been adequately and satisfactorily directed as to how to approach the absent witness’s statement. A similar conclusion was reached by the same court in HM Advocate v. M 2003 SLT 1151. 66.The compatibility of the admission of hearsay evidence with Article6 § 3 (d) was further considered by the High Court of Justiciary in Campbell v. HM Advocate (cited above). The court observed that, in the relevant case-law of this Court, many of the violations of Article 6 § 3 (d) which had been found had arisen in jurisdictions which did not apply the Scots law rule of corroboration: “Most of the situations in which it has been held by the court that there had been a violation of [Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] could not arise in Scotland. Against the requirement for corroboration of all crucial facts, a conviction could not be based solely on the evidence of a single witness, whether in primary or in secondary form. Violations of the Convention right have been established where the principal witness against the accused has not been made available for questioning or, in circumstances where there have been a number of principal witnesses, where none of them has been made so available. No case was cited to us in which a violation was held to have occurred in circumstances where the accused had had an opportunity to question or have questioned the complainer or other direct or central witness and other supporting evidence was in statement form. ‘To a decisive extent’, as used in the European authorities, appears to be concerned with the significance of the evidence as a matter of weight. It is not concerned with any rule that a conviction cannot be based on a single source of evidence. The fact that the hearsay is required to meet the rule about corroboration does not of itself render that hearsay ‘decisive’ in the European sense. In these circumstances we are not persuaded that in every case in which hearsay evidence is a necessary ingredient of the Crown’s corroborated proof there will be a violation of [Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)]. It will, however, be necessary for the trial judge to address, in the context of the whole evidence in the case, the significance of any hearsay evidence relied on by the Crown and to take appropriate action to ensure that the accused’s entitlement to a fair trial is not violated thereby.” 67.The court added that, in directing a jury, the guidance given by the Lord Justice Clerk in the case of N v. HM Advocate (cited above), should be borne in mind. The High Court allowed the appeal of the first appellant in the case of Campbell (cited above) because of the inadequacy of the trial judge’s direction to the jury. It dismissed the second appellant’s appeal in so far as it related to Article 6 of the Convention, finding that the hearsay evidence was not decisive and that the principal evidence against him came from a witness who had testified in court. 68.Campbell was applied in HM Advocate v. Johnston 2004 SLT 1005 where, in a ruling given during the trial, the Lord Ordinary allowed the admission of a witness statement made to the police by a witness who subsequently died before trial; the statement was admissible, inter alia, because it could not be “decisive”. In Humphrey v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC 30, the High Court of Justiciary observed that it had “great difficulty” in understanding the meaning of the word “decisive” in the context of a case based on circumstantial evidence but, in that case, the evidence in the form of a police statement of a witness who had died was not “remotely decisive” and there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction without it. Similar results were reached in Allison v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC 63, and Harkins v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC69. 69.In its March 2010 Consultation Paper on Hearsay in Civil and Criminal Cases, the Law Reform Commission of Ireland provisionally recommended that, subject to existing common law and statutory inclusionary exceptions, hearsay should continue to be excluded in criminal proceedings. It also provisionally recommended that there should be no statutory introduction of a residual discretion to include hearsay evidence and that the concepts of reliability and necessity should not form the basis for reform of the hearsay rule because they lacked clarity. 70.The Commission also noted: “Article 38.1 of the Constitution of Ireland protects the right to cross-examination and that the free admissibility of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings would infringe this constitutionally protected right. There are dangers associated with allowing evidence of unavailable witnesses: it undermines the defendant’s right to a fair trial and creates the potential of miscarriages of justice arising if evidence adduced from the following categories of witnesses is admitted: Where the witness is dead (with the exception of dying declarations); Where a witness because of a bodily or mental infirmity cannot give evidence; Where the witness is outside of the jurisdiction; Where the witness cannot be found.” 71.The Commission declined to recommend that the statutory scheme in England and Wales and in particular section 114 of the 2003 Act, be adopted in . It observed: “This model of reform relaxes the rule in such a manner as to potentially render the rule against hearsay redundant. The categories of admissible hearsay under this model are extended significantly and, in light of the constitutional protection afforded to the right to cross-examination, the Commission is of the provisional opinion that to allow in untested evidence from frightened and unavailable witnesses would undermine this right. The Commission notes that it has provisionally recommended that the courts should retain a discretion to develop the hearsay rule if the necessity exists.” The Commission also found that (subject to possible reservations concerning the ultimate outcome in the present cases), the case-law of this Court appeared broadly in line with the approach taken in Irish law. 72.A strict approach to the exclusion of out-of-court statements has always been taken by the Australian courts (see, for example, Bannon v. The Queen (1995) 185 CLR 1). 73.The admission of hearsay in federal criminal proceedings in is now regulated by the Evidence Act 1995. Section 65 of the Act allows the admission of evidence as to previous representations (for example statements) when a witness is not available to give evidence about an “asserted fact”. Such evidence will be admissible, inter alia, when: (i) the representation was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication (section 65(2)(b)); or (ii) when the representation was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation was reliable (section 65(2)(c)). 74.The use of these provisions to admit the statement of a witness who died before trial was considered by the Federal Court of Australia in Williams v. The Queen (2000) 119 A Crim R 490. The court found that, in the circumstances of the case, the statement made to the police was not sufficiently reliable, particularly when the witness had reasons to tell the police what they wanted to hear. Equivalent statutory provisions were considered by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Harris v. The Queen (2005) 158 A Crim R 454, where the deceased complainant’s statement was found to be sufficiently reliable to be admitted, given that, inter alia, the complainant knew that the police would interview other witnesses in the case. 75.The law of hearsay in Canada has been reformed as a result of three principal decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, which created a “principled approach” to the admissibility of hearsay evidence. 75.The law of hearsay in Canada has been reformed as a result of three principal decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, which created a “principled approach” to the admissibility of hearsay evidence. 76.Firstly, in R. v. Khan [1990] 2 SCR 531, the Supreme Court found that the trial judge had erred in refusing to allow the victim, a three-and-a-half-year-old girl who alleged that she had been sexually assaulted, to give unsworn evidence and his refusal to allow the Crown to introduce statements the child had made to her mother fifteen minutes after the assault. If unsworn evidence could not be given there would be a danger that offences against very young children could never be prosecuted. In respect of the statements to the mother, the Supreme Court found that it was appropriate to take a more flexible but “principled” approach to hearsay. Despite the need for caution, hearsay could be admitted where the two general requirements of necessity and reliability were met. In determining admissibility the trial judge was required to have regard to the need to safeguard the interests of the accused. Concerns as to the credibility of the evidence remained to be addressed by submissions as to the weight to be accorded to it and submissions as to the quality of any corroborating evidence. 77.Secondly, in R. v. Smith [1992] 2 SCR 915 the Court approved the “principled approach” taken in Khan and found that two telephone calls made by the deceased to her mother shortly before her death were admissible. However, the mother’s evidence as to the contents of a third telephone call should have not been admitted as the conditions under which that call was made did not provide the “circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness” which would justify its admission without the possibility of cross-examination. 77.Secondly, in R. v. Smith [1992] 2 SCR 915 the Court approved the “principled approach” taken in Khan and found that two telephone calls made by the deceased to her mother shortly before her death were admissible. However, the mother’s evidence as to the contents of a third telephone call should have not been admitted as the conditions under which that call was made did not provide the “circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness” which would justify its admission without the possibility of cross-examination. 78.Khan and Smith were followed in R. v. Rockey [1996] 3 SCR 829. The Supreme Court was satisfied that any reasonable trial judge would have found it necessary to admit pre-trial statements made by a child, who was fiveyears old at trial, in which he complained that he had been sexually assaulted. It was observed by McLachlin J (concurring in judgment) that the case against the appellant was strong: the child’s statements were entirely consistent and supported, inter alia, by medical evidence and evidence of behavioural changes in him after the assault and the absence of any plausible explanation of someone other than the appellant perpetrating the assault. 79.The third and most significant development in the Supreme Court’s case-law was its judgment in R. v. Khewalon [2006] 2 SCR 787, which took a stricter approach to reliability. The case concerned a complaint of assault made by an elderly resident at a retirement home against one of the home’s employees. The patient, S., gave the police a videotaped statement; the statement was unsworn. After S.’s statement other residents came forward to give statements that they too had been assaulted by the accused. By the time of trial, all those who had made statements, including S, had either died or were no longer competent to testify. Some of the statements were admitted by the trial judge because of the striking similarity between them. The Court of Appeal for excluded all the statements and acquitted the accused. The Supreme Court dismissed the Crown’s appeal from that decision and affirmed the acquittal. The Supreme Court clarified its previous case-law on reliability and stated that the reliability requirement would generally be met by showing: (i) that there was no real concern about whether the statement was true or not because of the circumstances in which it came about; or (ii) that no real concern arose because the truth and accuracy of the statement could nonetheless be sufficiently tested by means other than cross-examination. It was for the trial judge to make a preliminary assessment of the “threshold” reliability of the statement and to leave the ultimate determination of its worth to the fact-finder/jury. All relevant factors had to be considered by the trial judge including, in appropriate cases, the presence of supporting or contradictory evidence. Charron J, giving the unanimous judgment of the court, stated (at paragraph49 of the judgment): “In some cases, because of the circumstances in which it came about, the contents of the hearsay statement may be so reliable that contemporaneous cross-examination of the declarant would add little if anything to the process. In other cases, the evidence may not be so cogent but the circumstances will allow for sufficient testing of evidence by means other than contemporaneous cross-examination. In these circumstances, the admission of the evidence will rarely undermine trial fairness. However, because trial fairness may encompass factors beyond the strict inquiry into necessity and reliability, even if the two criteria are met, the trial judge has the discretion to exclude hearsay evidence where its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.” 80.The court concluded that S.’s statements were not admissible. It observed that the charges against Khelawon in respect of S. were “entirely based” on the truthfulness of the allegations contained in S.’s statements (paragraph 101 of the judgment). The absence of any opportunity to cross-examine him had a bearing on the question of reliability and there were no adequate substitutes for testing the evidence. The principled exceptions to the hearsay rule did not provide a vehicle for founding a conviction on the basis of a police statement, videotaped or otherwise, without more (paragraph 106 of the judgment). Nor could the reliability requirement be met by relying on the inherent trustworthiness of the statement; this was not a case such as Khan where the cogency of the evidence was such that it would be pedantic to insist upon testing by cross-examination. S. was elderly and frail; his mental capacity was at issue and there was medical evidence that his injuries could have arisen from a fall. It was also not clear that he had understood the consequences of his statement for the accused. In the circumstances, S.’s unavailability for cross-examination posed significant limitations on the accused’s ability to test the evidence and, in turn, on the trier of fact’s ability to properly assess its worth. 81.In its report of November 2009, the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong proposed substantial reforms to the admission of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings in that jurisdiction. It proposed that the present rule in Hong Kong against the admission of hearsay evidence should be retained but there should be greater scope to admit hearsay evidence in specific circumstances. The Commission rejected the English statutory scheme contained in the 2003 Act, observing that Hong Kong had none of the statutory mechanisms for excluding hearsay which applied in England and Wales, such as section 126(1) of the 2003 Act and section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (see paragraphs 40 and 45 above). The Commission also observed that grounds for admitting hearsay under section 116 of the 2003 Act, although offering a fair degree of certainty and consistency in decision-making, had “an over-inclusive effect by allowing in all types of relevant evidence, including unreliable hearsay evidence” (paragraph 8.25 of the report). The Commission instead proposed a model of reform, which was based on the approach taken by the New Zealand Law Commission (see paragraph82 below) and the Canadian courts since Khelawon. It recommended that hearsay evidence should be admissible, inter alia, if the trial judge was satisfied that it was necessary to admit the hearsay evidence and that it was reliable. Assessment of reliability by a trial judge should include consideration of whether the hearsay evidence was supported by other admissible evidence. The Commission also recommended that, at any stage of criminal proceedings after hearsay evidence had been admitted, the court should have the power to direct the acquittal of the accused if the trial judge considered that it would be unsafe to convict. In reaching that decision, the court should have regard, inter alia, to the importance of such evidence to the case against the accused. The Commission also found that these recommendations meant that its model of reform would comply with the Chamber judgment in the present cases. 82.The New Zealand Law Commission, in its 1999 Report on Evidence, recommended that the admissibility of hearsay should be based on two considerations: reliability and necessity. That recommendation was enacted in the Evidence Act 2006, which came into force in 2007. Section 18(1) of the Act provides: “A hearsay statement is admissible in any proceeding if— (a)the circumstances relating to the statement provide reasonable assurance that the statement is reliable; and (b)either— (i)the maker of the statement is unavailable as a witness; or (ii)the Judge considers that undue expense or delay would be caused if the maker of the statement were required to be a witness.” (ii)the Judge considers that undue expense or delay would be caused if the maker of the statement were required to be a witness.” 83.“Circumstances” for these purposes are defined in section 16(1) as including: (a) the nature of the statement; (b) the contents of the statement; (c) the circumstances that relate to the making of the statement; (d) any circumstances that relate to the veracity of the person; and (e) any circumstances that relate to the accuracy of the observation of the person. 84.Section 8(1) of the Act provides that evidence must be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the risk that the evidence will (a) have an unfairly prejudicial effect on the proceeding; or (b) needlessly prolong the proceeding. Section 8(2) provides that in determining whether the probative value of evidence is outweighed by the risk that the evidence will have an unfairly prejudicial effect on a criminal proceeding, the judge must take into account the right of the defendant to offer an effective defence. 85.Although jury trials are no longer used in , it too has substantially reformed its law of hearsay. Section 3(4) of the Law of Evidence Amendment Act 45 of 1988 defines hearsay as evidence, whether oral or in writing, the probative value of which depends upon the credibility of any person other than the person giving evidence. By section 3(1) such hearsay evidence is not admissible unless (i) it is admitted by consent; (ii) the person upon whose credibility the evidence depends testifies; or (iii) the court is of the opinion that the evidence should be admitted in the interests of justice. Section 3(1)(c) provides that, in forming its opinion, the court must have regard to: (i) the nature of the proceedings; (ii) the nature of the evidence; (iii)the purpose for which the evidence is tendered; (iv) the probative value of the evidence; (v) the reason why the evidence is not given by the person upon whose credibility the probative value of such evidence depends; (vi)any prejudice to a party which the admission of such evidence might entail; and (vii) any factor which should in the opinion of the court be taken into account. 85.Although jury trials are no longer used in , it too has substantially reformed its law of hearsay. Section 3(4) of the Law of Evidence Amendment Act 45 of 1988 defines hearsay as evidence, whether oral or in writing, the probative value of which depends upon the credibility of any person other than the person giving evidence. By section 3(1) such hearsay evidence is not admissible unless (i) it is admitted by consent; (ii) the person upon whose credibility the evidence depends testifies; or (iii) the court is of the opinion that the evidence should be admitted in the interests of justice. Section 3(1)(c) provides that, in forming its opinion, the court must have regard to: (i) the nature of the proceedings; (ii) the nature of the evidence; (iii)the purpose for which the evidence is tendered; (iv) the probative value of the evidence; (v) the reason why the evidence is not given by the person upon whose credibility the probative value of such evidence depends; (vi)any prejudice to a party which the admission of such evidence might entail; and (vii) any factor which should in the opinion of the court be taken into account. 86.In State v. Ramavhale [1996] ZASCA 14, the Supreme Court observed that, notwithstanding the wording of section 3(1), there remained an “intuitive reluctance to permit untested evidence to be used against an accused in a criminal case”. It also endorsed previous authority that a court should “hesitate long” in admitting or relying on hearsay evidence which plays a decisive or even significant part in convicting an accused, unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. Despite the reforms enacted by section 3(1), the Supreme Court found that reliability was a factor that should continue to be considered in determining the admissibility of hearsay. Moreover, in that case, in assessing what prejudice would arise to the accused if the hearsay were admitted, the trial judge had erred in relying upon the fact that the accused had other avenues open to him to counter the evidence, one of which was to give evidence himself; the logical conclusion of this approach was that the State, by introducing “flimsy” hearsay could force the accused to testify in a case where the absence of direct evidence was such that he would be entitled not to testify. Compelling reasons for admitting hearsay evidence, even though it was decisive, were found to exist in State v. Ndhlovu and others [2002] ZASCA70, not least because the guarantees as to the reliability of the evidence were high and the hearsay evidence interlinked powerfully with the other evidence in the case. The concerns expressed in Ramavhale as to admitting or relying on hearsay evidence which played a decisive or even significant part in convicting an accused were reiterated by the Supreme Court in State v. Libazi and others [2010] ZASCA 91, State v. Mpungose and another [2011] ZASCA 60, and State v. Mamushe [2007] ZASCA 58. In the latter, the Supreme Court observed that it stood to reason that a hearsay statement which would only serve to complete a “mosaic pattern” would be more readily admitted than one which was destined to become a vital part of the State’s case. 87.The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America guarantees the accused in all criminal prosecutions the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him (“the confrontation clause”). In Ohio v. Roberts 448 US 56 (1980) the Supreme Court of the United States of America held that evidence with “particularized guarantees of trustworthiness” was admissible without confrontation. That was overruled in Crawford v.Washington 541 US 36 (2004), where the court ruled that the confrontation clause applied to all evidence which was testimonial in nature and there was no basis in the Sixth Amendment for admitting evidence only on the basis of its reliability. Where testimonial statements were at issue, the only indicium of reliability which was sufficient was the one prescribed by the Constitution: confrontation. Consequently, testimonial evidence was thus inadmissible unless the witness appeared at trial or, if the witness was unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination (see also Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts 129 SCt 2527 (2009), and Bullcoming v. New Mexico 131 SCt 2705 (2011)). The right to confront witnesses will be forfeited if it can be demonstrated that the defendant has frightened the witness into not testifying (see Davis v.Washington 547 US 813 (2006), and Giles v. California 554 US 353 (2008).",2011,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY ASSESSED THE IMPACT THAT THE DEFENDANT’S INABILITY TO EXAMINE A WITNESS HAS HAD ON THE OVERALL FAIRNESS OF HIS TRIAL. IT HAS ALWAYS CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UNTESTED EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DEFENDANT’S RIGHTS HAVE BEEN UNACCEPTABLY RESTRICTED (SEE, AS EARLY EXAMPLES, UNTERPERTINGER, CITED ABOVE, AND BRICMONT V. BELGIUM, 7 JULY 1989, SERIES A NO. 158; AND, MORE RECENTLY, KORNEV AND KARPENKO V. UKRAINE, NO. 17444/04, §§ 54-57, 21 OCTOBER 2010; CAKA V. ALBANIA, NO. 44023/02, §§ 112-16, 8 DECEMBER 2009; GUILLOURY V. FRANCE, NO. 62236/00, §§ 57-62, 22 JUNE 2006; AND A.M. V. ITALY; KRASNIKI; LUCÀ; AND SAÏDI, ALL CITED ABOVE).
THE COMMISSION HAD TAKEN THE SAME APPROACH IN ITS CASE-LAW (SEE, AMONG THE EARLIEST CASES OF THE COMMISSION, X. V. AUSTRIA, NO. 4428/70, COMMISSION DECISION OF 1 JUNE 1972, COLLECTION 40, P. 1; X. V. BELGIUM, NO. 8417/78, COMMISSION DECISION OF 4 MAY 1979, DECISIONS AND REPORTS (DR) 16, P. 205; X. V. GERMANY, NO. 8414/78, COMMISSION DECISION OF 4 JULY 1979, DR 17, P. 231; AND S. V. GERMANY, NO. 8945/80, COMMISSION DECISION OF 13 DECEMBER 1983, DR 39, P. 43).
AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THE COURT HAS ALWAYS INTERPRETED ARTICLE 6 § 3 IN THE CONTEXT OF AN OVERALL EXAMINATION OF THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS. (SEE, AS A RECENT AUTHORITY, SALDUZ V. TURKEY [GC], NO. 36391/02, § 50, ECHR 2008).
144.  TRADITIONALLY, WHEN EXAMINING COMPLAINTS UNDER ARTICLE 6 § 1, THE COURT HAS CARRIED OUT ITS EXAMINATION OF THE OVERALL FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS BY HAVING REGARD TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE WAY IN WHICH STATUTORY SAFEGUARDS HAVE BEEN APPLIED, THE EXTENT TO WHICH PROCEDURAL OPPORTUNITIES WERE AFFORDED TO THE DEFENCE TO COUNTER HANDICAPS THAT IT LABOURED UNDER AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PROCEEDINGS AS A WHOLE HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED BY THE TRIAL JUDGE (SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, JOHN MURRAY, CITED ABOVE).
145.  ALSO, IN CASES CONCERNING THE WITHHOLDING OF EVIDENCE FROM THE DEFENCE IN ORDER TO PROTECT POLICE SOURCES, THE COURT HAS LEFT IT TO THE DOMESTIC COURTS TO DECIDE WHETHER THE RIGHTS OF THE DEFENCE SHOULD CEDE TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND HAS CONFINED ITSELF TO VERIFYING WHETHER THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED BY THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES SUFFICIENTLY COUNTERBALANCE THE LIMITATIONS ON THE DEFENCE WITH APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS. THE FACT THAT CERTAIN EVIDENCE WAS NOT MADE AVAILABLE TO THE DEFENCE WAS NOT CONSIDERED AUTOMATICALLY TO LEAD TO A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 (SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, ROWE AND DAVIS V. THE UNITED KINGDOM [GC], NO. 28901/95, ECHR 2000II). SIMILARLY, IN SALDUZ (CITED ABOVE, § 50), THE COURT REITERATED THAT THE RIGHT TO LEGAL ASSISTANCE, SET OUT IN ARTICLE 6 § 3 (C) WAS ONE ELEMENT, AMONG OTHERS, OF THE CONCEPT OF A FAIR TRIAL IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 6 § 1.
146.  THE COURT IS OF THE VIEW THAT THE SOLE OR DECISIVE RULE SHOULD ALSO BE APPLIED IN A SIMILAR MANNER. IT WOULD NOT BE CORRECT, WHEN REVIEWING QUESTIONS OF FAIRNESS, TO APPLY THIS RULE IN AN INFLEXIBLE MANNER. NOR WOULD IT BE CORRECT FOR THE COURT TO IGNORE ENTIRELY THE SPECIFICITIES OF THE PARTICULAR LEGAL SYSTEM CONCERNED AND, IN PARTICULAR ITS RULES OF EVIDENCE, NOTWITHSTANDING JUDICIAL DICTA THAT MAY HAVE SUGGESTED OTHERWISE (SEE, FOR INSTANCE, LUCÀ, CITED ABOVE, § 40). TO DO SO WOULD TRANSFORM THE RULE INTO A BLUNT AND INDISCRIMINATE INSTRUMENT THAT RUNS COUNTER TO THE TRADITIONAL WAY IN WHICH THE COURT APPROACHES THE ISSUE OF THE OVERALL FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS, NAMELY TO WEIGH IN THE BALANCE THE COMPETING INTERESTS OF THE DEFENCE, THE VICTIM, AND WITNESSES, AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
(C)  GENERAL CONCLUSION ON THE SOLE OR DECISIVE RULE
(C)  GENERAL CONCLUSION ON THE SOLE OR DECISIVE RULE
147.  THE COURT THEREFORE CONCLUDES THAT, WHERE A HEARSAY STATEMENT IS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST A DEFENDANT, ITS ADMISSION AS EVIDENCE WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY RESULT IN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1. AT THE SAME TIME, WHERE A CONVICTION IS BASED SOLELY OR DECISIVELY ON THE EVIDENCE OF ABSENT WITNESSES, THE COURT MUST SUBJECT THE PROCEEDINGS TO THE MOST SEARCHING SCRUTINY. BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF THE ADMISSION OF SUCH EVIDENCE, IT WOULD CONSTITUTE A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR TO BALANCE IN THE SCALES, TO USE THE WORDS OF LORD MANCE IN R. V. DAVIS (SEE PARAGRAPH 50 ABOVE), AND ONE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS, INCLUDING THE EXISTENCE OF STRONG PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS. THE QUESTION IN EACH CASE IS WHETHER THERE ARE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS IN PLACE, INCLUDING MEASURES THAT PERMIT A FAIR AND PROPER ASSESSMENT OF THE RELIABILITY OF THAT EVIDENCE TO TAKE PLACE. THIS WOULD PERMIT A CONVICTION TO BE BASED ON SUCH EVIDENCE ONLY IF IT IS SUFFICIENTLY RELIABLE GIVEN ITS IMPORTANCE IN THE CASE.
(D)  PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS CONTAINED IN THE 1988 AND 2003 ACTS
148.  THE COURT WILL THEREFORE EXAMINE THE COUNTERBALANCING MEASURES IN PLACE IN ENGLISH LAW AT THE RELEVANT TIME. THE COURT OBSERVES THAT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE 1988 AND 2003 ACTS THE ABSENCE OF WITNESSES MUST BE JUSTIFIED AND FALL WITHIN ONE OF THE DEFINED CATEGORIES (SEE SECTION 23 OF THE 1988 ACT AND SECTION 116 OF THE 2003 ACT AT PARAGRAPHS 41 AND 44 ABOVE). WHATEVER THE REASONS FOR THE ABSENCE OF A WITNESS, THE ADMISSION OF STATEMENTS OF A WITNESS WHO IS NOT ONLY ABSENT BUT ANONYMOUS IS NOT ADMISSIBLE.
MOREOVER, WHERE THE ABSENCE IS DUE TO FEAR, UNDER THE 2003 ACT, THE TRIAL JUDGE MAY ONLY GIVE LEAVE IF HE CONSIDERS THE ADMISSION OF THE STATEMENT TO BE IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE AND HE MUST DECIDE WHETHER SPECIAL MEASURES CAN BE PUT IN PLACE TO ALLOW THE WITNESS TO GIVE LIVE EVIDENCE. IN SUCH A CASE, THE TRIAL JUDGE MUST HAVE REGARD TO THE DIFFICULTY FACED BY THE DEFENDANT IN CHALLENGING THE WITNESS STATEMENT IF THE MAKER OF THE STATEMENT IS NOT CALLED.
149.  THE 2003 ACT ALSO PROVIDES THAT, WHATEVER THE REASON FOR THE ABSENCE OF A WITNESS, EVIDENCE RELEVANT TO THE CREDIBILITY OR CONSISTENCY OF THE MAKER OF THE STATEMENT MAY BE ADMITTED EVEN WHERE THE EVIDENCE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ADMISSIBLE HAD THE WITNESS GIVEN EVIDENCE IN PERSON. THE TRIAL JUDGE RETAINS A SPECIFIC DISCRETION TO REFUSE TO ADMIT A HEARSAY STATEMENT IF SATISFIED THAT THE CASE FOR ITS EXCLUSION SUBSTANTIALLY OUTWEIGHS THE CASE FOR ADMITTING IT. OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE IS THE REQUIREMENT UNDER THE 2003 ACT THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE SHOULD STOP THE PROCEEDINGS IF SATISFIED AT THE CLOSE OF THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION THAT THE CASE AGAINST THE ACCUSED IS BASED “WHOLLY OR PARTLY” ON A HEARSAY STATEMENT ADMITTED UNDER THE 2003 ACT, PROVIDED HE OR SHE IS ALSO SATISFIED THAT THE STATEMENT IN QUESTION IS SO UNCONVINCING THAT, CONSIDERING ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE CASE AGAINST THE ACCUSED, A CONVICTION WOULD BE UNSAFE.
150.  THE COURT ALSO NOTES THAT, IN ADDITION TO THE SAFEGUARDS CONTAINED IN EACH ACT, SECTION 78 OF THE POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT 1984 PROVIDES A GENERAL DISCRETION TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE IF ITS ADMISSION WOULD HAVE SUCH AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FAIRNESS OF THE TRIAL THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE ADMITTED. FINALLY, THE COMMON LAW REQUIRES A TRIAL JUDGE TO GIVE THE JURY THE TRADITIONAL DIRECTION ON THE BURDEN OF PROOF, AND DIRECT THEM AS TO THE DANGERS OF RELYING ON A HEARSAY STATEMENT.
151.  THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THE SAFEGUARDS CONTAINED IN THE 1988 AND 2003 ACTS, SUPPORTED BY THOSE CONTAINED IN SECTION 78 OF THE POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT AND THE COMMON LAW, ARE, IN PRINCIPLE, STRONG SAFEGUARDS DESIGNED TO ENSURE FAIRNESS. IT REMAINS TO BE EXAMINED HOW THESE SAFEGUARDS WERE APPLIED IN THE PRESENT CASES.
4.  THE PRESENT CASES
152.  IN TURNING TO THE PRESENT CASES, THE COURT BEGINS BY OBSERVING THAT, IN THE COURSE OF THE HEARING BEFORE THE GRAND CHAMBER, A QUESTION WAS PUT TO THE PARTIES AS TO WHETHER IT WAS ACCEPTED THAT THE TESTIMONY OF S.T. WAS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE EVIDENCE IN RESPECT OF MR AL-KHAWAJA AND THAT THE TESTIMONY OF T. WAS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE EVIDENCE IN RESPECT OF MR TAHERY. IN REPLY TO THAT QUESTION, THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTED FROM THE POSITION THEY HAD TAKEN BEFORE THE CHAMBER AND SUBMITTED THAT NEITHER S.T. NOR T.’S TESTIMONY WAS SOLE OR DECISIVE (SEE PARAGRAPHS 104 AND 105 ABOVE). THE COURT WILL THEREFORE CONSIDER THREE ISSUES IN EACH CASE: FIRSTLY, WHETHER IT WAS NECESSARY TO ADMIT THE WITNESS STATEMENTS OF S.T. OR T.; SECONDLY, WHETHER THEIR UNTESTED EVIDENCE WAS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE BASIS FOR EACH APPLICANT’S CONVICTION; AND THIRDLY, WHETHER THERE WERE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS INCLUDING STRONG PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT EACH TRIAL, JUDGED AS A WHOLE, WAS FAIR WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 6 §§ 1 AND 3 (D).
(A)  THE AL-KHAWAJA CASE
153.  THE COURT OBSERVES THAT IT IS NOT IN DISPUTE THAT S.T.’S DEATH MADE IT NECESSARY TO ADMIT HER WITNESS STATEMENT IF HER EVIDENCE WAS TO BE CONSIDERED.
154.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE GOVERNMENT’S SUBMISSION THAT S.T.’S STATEMENT WAS NOT SOLE OR DECISIVE BECAUSE THERE WAS OTHER EVIDENCE SUPPORTING IT, THE COURT NOTES THAT THE JUDGE WHO ADMITTED S.T.’S STATEMENT WAS WELL PLACED TO EVALUATE ITS SIGNIFICANCE. HE WAS QUITE CLEAR WHEN HE OBSERVED “NO STATEMENT, NO COUNT ONE” (SEE PARAGRAPH 13 ABOVE). IT IS NOT FOR THE COURT, SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS, TO GAINSAY SUCH AN EVALUATION. THE COURT IS THEREFORE COMPELLED TO CONCLUDE THAT S.T.’S STATEMENT WAS DECISIVE.
155.  NEVERTHELESS, AS THE COURT HAS INDICATED (SEE PARAGRAPH 147 ABOVE) THE ADMISSION OF THE STATEMENT IN EVIDENCE CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS CONCLUSIVE AS TO THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE TRIAL, BUT AS A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR TO BE PLACED IN THE BALANCE ALONGSIDE THE PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS NOTED ABOVE AND OTHER COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS PRESENT IN THE CASE.
156.  THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE WERE OBVIOUSLY IN FAVOUR OF ADMITTING IN EVIDENCE THE STATEMENT OF S.T., WHICH WAS RECORDED BY THE POLICE IN PROPER FORM. THE RELIABILITY OF THE EVIDENCE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT S.T. HAD MADE HER COMPLAINT TO TWO FRIENDS, B.F. AND S.H., PROMPTLY AFTER THE EVENTS IN QUESTION, AND THAT THERE WERE ONLY MINOR INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN HER STATEMENT AND THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY HER TO THE TWO FRIENDS, WHO BOTH GAVE EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THERE WERE STRONG SIMILARITIES BETWEEN S.T.’S DESCRIPTION OF THE ALLEGED ASSAULT AND THAT OF THE OTHER COMPLAINANT, V.U., WITH WHOM THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY COLLUSION. IN A CASE OF INDECENT ASSAULT BY A DOCTOR ON HIS PATIENT, WHICH TOOK PLACE DURING A PRIVATE CONSULTATION WHERE ONLY HE AND THE VICTIM WERE PRESENT, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE OF STRONGER CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN EACH OF THE OTHER WITNESSES WAS CALLED TO GIVE EVIDENCE AT TRIAL AND THEIR RELIABILITY WAS TESTED BY CROSS-EXAMINATION.
157.  IT IS TRUE THAT THE JUDGE’S DIRECTION TO THE JURY WAS FOUND TO BE DEFICIENT BY THE COURT OF APPEAL. HOWEVER, THE COURT OF APPEAL ALSO HELD THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN CLEAR TO THE JURY FROM THAT DIRECTION THAT, IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE APPLICANT’S INABILITY TO CROSS-EXAMINE S.T. AND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO SEE AND HEAR HER, HER STATEMENT SHOULD CARRY LESS WEIGHT WITH THEM (SEE PARAGRAPH 22 ABOVE). HAVING REGARD TO THIS DIRECTION, AND THE EVIDENCE OFFERED BY THE PROSECUTION IN SUPPORT OF S.T.’S STATEMENT, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THE JURY WAS ABLE TO CONDUCT A FAIR AND PROPER ASSESSMENT OF THE RELIABILITY OF S.T.’S ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE FIRST APPLICANT.
158.  AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, AND VIEWING THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS AS A WHOLE, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFICULTIES CAUSED TO THE DEFENCE BY ADMITTING THE STATEMENT AND THE DANGERS OF DOING SO, THERE WERE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS TO CONCLUDE THAT THE ADMISSION IN EVIDENCE OF S.T.’S STATEMENT DID NOT RESULT IN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D).
(B)  THE TAHERY CASE
159.  THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT APPROPRIATE ENQUIRIES WERE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE WERE OBJECTIVE GROUNDS FOR T.’S FEAR. THE TRIAL JUDGE HEARD EVIDENCE FROM BOTH T. AND A POLICE OFFICER AS TO THAT FEAR. THE TRIAL JUDGE WAS ALSO SATISFIED THAT SPECIAL MEASURES, SUCH AS TESTIFYING BEHIND A SCREEN, WOULD NOT ALLAY T.’S FEARS. EVEN THOUGH T.’S IDENTITY AS THE MAKER OF THE INCRIMINATING STATEMENT WAS PUBLICLY DISCLOSED, THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRIAL JUDGE THAT T. HAD A GENUINE FEAR OF GIVING ORAL EVIDENCE AND WAS NOT PREPARED TO DO SO EVEN IF SPECIAL MEASURES WERE INTRODUCED IN THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS PROVIDES A SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION FOR ADMITTING T.’S STATEMENT.

HAD A GENUINE FEAR OF GIVING ORAL EVIDENCE AND WAS NOT PREPARED TO DO SO EVEN IF SPECIAL MEASURES WERE INTRODUCED IN THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS PROVIDES A SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION FOR ADMITTING T.’S STATEMENT.
160.  THE COURT NOTES THAT WHEN THOSE PRESENT AT THE SCENE OF THE STABBING WERE ORIGINALLY INTERVIEWED, NO ONE CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN THE APPLICANT STAB S, AND S HIMSELF HAD NOT SEEN WHO HAD STABBED HIM, ALTHOUGH INITIALLY HE PRESUMED IT WAS THE SECOND APPLICANT. T. HAD MADE HIS STATEMENT IMPLICATING THE APPLICANT TWO DAYS AFTER THE EVENT. HE WAS THE ONLY WITNESS WHO HAD CLAIMED TO SEE THE STABBING. HIS UNCORROBORATED EYEWITNESS STATEMENT WAS, IF NOT THE SOLE, AT LEAST THE DECISIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE APPLICANT FOR THAT REASON. IT WAS OBVIOUSLY EVIDENCE OF GREAT WEIGHT AND WITHOUT IT THE CHANCES OF A CONVICTION WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY RECEDED. EVEN THOUGH THE TESTIMONY MAY HAVE BEEN COHERENT AND CONVINCING ON ITS FACE IT CANNOT BE SAID TO BELONG TO THE CATEGORY OF EVIDENCE THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS “DEMONSTRABLY RELIABLE” SUCH AS A DYING DECLARATION OR OTHER EXAMPLES GIVEN BY THE COURT OF APPEAL AND SUPREME COURT IN THEIR HORNCASTLE AND OTHERS JUDGMENTS (SEE PARAGRAPHS 53 AND 60 ABOVE).
161.  SUCH UNTESTED EVIDENCE WEIGHS HEAVILY IN THE BALANCE AND REQUIRES SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE CONSEQUENTIAL DIFFICULTIES CAUSED TO THE DEFENCE BY ITS ADMISSION. RELIANCE IS PLACED BY THE GOVERNMENT ON TWO MAIN COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS: THE FACT THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE CONCLUDED THAT NO UNFAIRNESS WOULD BE CAUSED BY THE ADMISSION OF T.’S STATEMENT SINCE THE APPLICANT WAS IN A POSITION TO CHALLENGE OR REBUT THE STATEMENT BY GIVING EVIDENCE HIMSELF OR CALLING OTHER WITNESSES WHO WERE PRESENT, ONE OF WHOM WAS HIS UNCLE; AND THE WARNING GIVEN BY THE TRIAL JUDGE TO THE JURY THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO APPROACH THE EVIDENCE GIVEN BY THE ABSENT WITNESS WITH CARE.
162.  HOWEVER, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT NEITHER OF THESE FACTORS, WHETHER TAKEN ALONE OR IN COMBINATION, COULD BE A SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCE TO THE HANDICAP UNDER WHICH THE DEFENCE LABOURED. EVEN IF HE GAVE EVIDENCE DENYING THE CHARGE, THE APPLICANT WAS, OF COURSE, UNABLE TO TEST THE TRUTHFULNESS AND RELIABILITY OF T.’S EVIDENCE BY MEANS OF CROSS-EXAMINATION. THE FACT IS THAT T. WAS THE SOLE WITNESS WHO WAS APPARENTLY WILLING OR ABLE TO SAY WHAT HE HAD SEEN. THE DEFENCE WAS NOT ABLE TO CALL ANY OTHER WITNESS TO CONTRADICT THE TESTIMONY PROVIDED IN THE HEARSAY STATEMENT.
163.  THE OTHER EVIDENCE WAS THAT GIVEN BY THE VICTIM S WHO DID NOT KNOW WHO HAD STABBED HIM, ALTHOUGH INITIALLY HE PRESUMED IT WAS THE APPLICANT. HIS EVIDENCE WAS CIRCUMSTANTIAL IN NATURE AND LARGELY UNCONTESTED BY THE APPLICANT. HE GAVE EVIDENCE OF THE FIGHT AND THE APPLICANT’S ACTIONS AFTER THE STABBING (SEE PARAGRAPH 32 ABOVE). WHILE THIS EVIDENCE CORROBORATED SOME OF THE DETAILS OF T.’S TESTIMONY, IT COULD ONLY PROVIDE AT BEST INDIRECT SUPPORT FOR THE CLAIM BY T. THAT IT WAS THE APPLICANT WHO HAD STABBED S.
164.  IT IS TRUE THAT THE DIRECTION IN THE JUDGE’S SUMMING UP TO THE JURY WAS BOTH FULL AND CAREFULLY PHRASED, DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE DANGERS OF RELYING ON UNTESTED EVIDENCE. HOWEVER, THE COURT DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT SUCH A WARNING, HOWEVER CLEARLY OR FORCIBLY EXPRESSED, COULD BE A SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCE WHERE AN UNTESTED STATEMENT OF THE ONLY PROSECUTION EYEWITNESS WAS THE ONLY DIRECT EVIDENCE AGAINST THE APPLICANT.
165.  THE COURT THEREFORE CONSIDERS THAT THE DECISIVE NATURE OF T.’S STATEMENT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY STRONG CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE MEANT THE JURY IN THIS CASE WAS UNABLE TO CONDUCT A FAIR AND PROPER ASSESSMENT OF THE RELIABILITY OF T.’S EVIDENCE. EXAMINING THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS AS A WHOLE, THE COURT CONCLUDES THAT THERE WERE NOT SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DIFFICULTIES TO THE DEFENCE WHICH RESULTED FROM THE ADMISSION OF T.’S STATEMENT. IT THEREFORE FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D) IN RESPECT OF MR TAHERY.
II.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION
166.  ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION PROVIDES:
“IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION OR THE PROTOCOLS THERETO, AND IF THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTY CONCERNED ALLOWS ONLY PARTIAL REPARATION TO BE MADE, THE COURT SHALL, IF NECESSARY, AFFORD JUST SATISFACTION TO THE INJURED PARTY.”
167.  AS NO VIOLATION HAS BEEN FOUND IN RESPECT OF THE FIRST APPLICANT, JUST SATISFACTION NEED ONLY BE CONSIDERED IN RESPECT OF THE SECOND APPLICANT.
168.  THE SECOND APPLICANT MAINTAINED HIS SUBMISSION THAT, UNLIKE THE MAJORITY OF ARTICLE 6 CASES, IT COULD PROPERLY BE SAID THAT HIS CONVICTION FOR THE OFFENCE IN QUESTION AND HIS SUBSEQUENT SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE VIOLATION. BASED ON THE ADDITIONAL TIME HE SERVED IN PRISON AND WITH REFERENCE TO COMPARABLE DOMESTIC AWARDS FOR UNLAWFUL DETENTION, THE SECOND APPLICANT CLAIMED 65,000 POUNDS STERLING (GBP) (APPROXIMATELY 83,830 EUROS (EUR)). THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THEIR SUBMISSIONS THAT THERE WAS NO CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ALLEGED VIOLATION AND THE CONVICTION OF THE APPLICANT, THAT DOMESTIC CASE-LAW WAS OF LIMITED RELEVANCE AND THAT ANY FINDING OF A VIOLATION AMOUNTED TO SUFFICIENT JUST SATISFACTION. ALTERNATIVELY, A MUCH LOWER SUM, SUCH AS THE EUR 6,000 AWARDED IN VISSER V. THE NETHERLANDS (NO. 26668/95, § 56, 14 FEBRUARY 2002), WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
169.  IN ITS JUDGMENT, THE CHAMBER ACCEPTED THAT DOMESTIC CASE-LAW WAS OF LIMITED RELEVANCE TO THE QUESTION OF NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE IN PROCEEDINGS BEFORE IT. IT FOUND, HOWEVER, THAT THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE SECOND APPLICANT, AT LEAST IN RESPECT OF THE CHARGE WHICH WAS BASED ON T.’S STATEMENT, WAS NOT CONDUCTED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CONVENTION AND THAT THE APPLICANT HAD INEVITABLY SUFFERED A DEGREE OF DISTRESS AND ANXIETY AS A RESULT. IT AWARDED THE SUM OF EUR 6,000 BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE.
170.  THE GRAND CHAMBER SEES NO REASON TO DEPART FROM THE CHAMBER’S ASSESSMENT AND ACCORDINGLY MAKES THE SAME AWARD OF EUR 6,000.
171.  BEFORE THE CHAMBER, THE SECOND APPLICANT CLAIMED A TOTAL OF GBP 7,995 FOR COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY EUR 9,079. THIS COMPRISED GBP 5,571.47 (INCLUSIVE OF VALUE-ADDED TAX (VAT)) FOR APPROXIMATELY 45 HOURS’ WORK BY MS TROWLER, WHICH INCLUDED ATTENDANCE AT THE CHAMBER HEARING AND TRAVELLING TIME TO STRASBOURG. SOLICITOR’S COSTS AND EXPENSES WERE GBP 2,423.56 (INCLUSIVE OF VAT) WHICH COVERED COSTS OF GBP 1,734.16 FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 HOURS’ WORK AND GBP 689.40 IN EXPENSES.
172.  BEFORE THE GRAND CHAMBER, THE SECOND APPLICANT CLAIMED A TOTAL OF GBP 3,614.82 IN RESPECT OF SOLICITOR’S COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH COVERED THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE CHAMBER AND THE GRAND CHAMBER. HE ALSO CLAIMED AN ADDITIONAL GBP 3,643 (INCLUSIVE OF VAT) FOR A FURTHER 37 HOURS’ WORK BY MS TROWLER. THIS INCLUDED 17 HOURS’ WORK TO COVER HER ANTICIPATED ATTENDANCE AT THE GRAND CHAMBER HEARING AND TRAVELLING TIME TO STRASBOURG. SHE WAS, IN THE EVENT, UNABLE TO ATTEND THE HEARING.
173.  THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED THE HOURLY RATES WHICH HAD BEEN CHARGED TO BE EXCESSIVE.
174.  THE COURT FINDS THAT THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED ARE NOT EXCESSIVE IN THE LIGHT OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CASE. THUS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 17 HOURS’ ATTENDANCE AND TRAVELLING TIME TO THE GRAND CHAMBER HEARING (WHICH WERE NOT ACTUALLY INCURRED), THE REMAINDER OF THE SECOND APPLICANT’S COSTS AND EXPENSES SHOULD BE MET IN FULL. IT THEREFORE AWARDS EUR 13,150, INCLUSIVE OF VAT, LESS EUR 1,150 ALREADY RECEIVED IN LEGAL AID FROM THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, TO BE CONVERTED INTO POUNDS STERLING ON THE DATE OF SETTLEMENT.
175.  THE COURT CONSIDERS IT APPROPRIATE THAT THE DEFAULT INTEREST RATE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE MARGINAL LENDING RATE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, TO WHICH SHOULD BE ADDED THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS.
FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT
1.  HOLDS, BY FIFTEEN VOTES TO TWO, THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D) IN RESPECT OF MR AL-KHAWAJA;
2.  HOLDS, UNANIMOUSLY, THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D) IN RESPECT OF MR TAHERY;
3.  HOLDS, UNANIMOUSLY,
(A)  THAT THE RESPONDENT STATE IS TO PAY THE SECOND APPLICANT, MR TAHERY, WITHIN THREE MONTHS, THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS, TO BE CONVERTED INTO POUNDS STERLING AT THE RATE APPLICABLE AT THE DATE OF SETTLEMENT:
(B)  THAT FROM THE EXPIRY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED THREE MONTHS UNTIL SETTLEMENT SIMPLE INTEREST SHALL BE PAYABLE ON THE ABOVE AMOUNTS AT A RATE EQUAL TO THE MARGINAL LENDING RATE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK DURING THE DEFAULT PERIOD PLUS THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS;
4.  DISMISSES, UNANIMOUSLY, THE REMAINDER OF THE APPLICANTS’ CLAIM FOR JUST SATISFACTION.
"
56,001-108072,Grand Chamber,"9.The first applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Brighton. The facts which gave rise to his application are as follows. 10.While working as a consultant physician in the field of rehabilitative medicine, the first applicant was charged on two counts of indecent assault on two female patients while they were allegedly under hypnosis. The first count in the indictment alleged that he had indecently assaulted a woman called S.T. during a consultation on 3 June 2003. The second count in the indictment alleged that he had indecently assaulted a woman called V.U. also during a consultation, this time on 12 June 2003. 11.For reasons unrelated to the alleged assault, S.T. committed suicide before the trial. However, several months after the alleged assault, she had made a statement to the police. She had also told two friends, B.F. and S.H., that the applicant had indecently assaulted her. 11.For reasons unrelated to the alleged assault, S.T. committed suicide before the trial. However, several months after the alleged assault, she had made a statement to the police. She had also told two friends, B.F. and S.H., that the applicant had indecently assaulted her. 12.On 22 March 2004 a preliminary hearing was held to determine whether S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury. At that hearing, the defence indicated that the defence to each count of the indictment was essentially the same, namely that S.T. and V.U.’s allegations were wholly untrue. The judge at the hearing decided that S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury at trial. He observed that the first applicant was very likely to feel that he had no realistic alternative other than to give evidence in order to defend himself on the second count relating to V.U. Therefore, the reading of S.T.’s statement would not have the effect of making it very difficult for the applicant not to give evidence. The judge also noted that collusion between S.T. and V.U. was not alleged, and so that issue did not need to be investigated by cross-examination of each woman. 12.On 22 March 2004 a preliminary hearing was held to determine whether S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury.

He observed that the first applicant was very likely to feel that he had no realistic alternative other than to give evidence in order to defend himself on the second count relating to V.U. Therefore, the reading of S.T.’s statement would not have the effect of making it very difficult for the applicant not to give evidence. The judge also noted that collusion between S.T. and V.U. was not alleged, and so that issue did not need to be investigated by cross-examination of each woman. 13.Having regard to the contents of S.T.’s statement, the judge also observed that it was crucial to the prosecution on count one as there was no other direct evidence of what took place during the consultation on 3 June 2003. He said: “[P]utting it bluntly, no statement, no count one.” He went on to observe that the real issue was whether it was likely to be possible for the first applicant to controvert the statement in a way that achieved fairness to the defendant. The judge found that the first applicant could give evidence as to what had happened during the consultation. It was also the intention of the prosecution to call S.T.’s friends to give evidence as to what she had said to them. There were inconsistencies between their statements and S.T.’s, which provided a route by which S.T.’s statement could be challenged. An expert witness would also be called by the prosecution to give evidence on altered perception during hypnosis and cross-examination of that witness might also serve to undermine S.T.’s credibility. 14.At the trial, once S.T.’s statement had been read, the jury heard evidence from B.F. and S.H., S.T.’s friends. S.T.’s general practitioner also gave evidence as to a letter he had written on S.T.’s behalf to the hospital authorities, which outlined S.T.’s allegations against the first applicant. In respect of the second count, the indecent assault upon V.U., evidence was given by V.U. and by the police officers who had investigated the case. Evidence was then given by two women who alleged that the first applicant had made improper suggestions to them during hypnosis consultations. That evidence was relied on by the prosecution as “similar fact evidence” to support the evidence of S.T. and V.U. As the prosecution had indicated, expert evidence was given as to the effects of hypnosis. The defence was given the opportunity to cross-examine all the witnesses who gave live evidence. The first applicant gave evidence in his own defence. He also called a number of witnesses, who gave evidence as to his good character. 14.At the trial, once S.T.’s statement had been read, the jury heard evidence from B.F. and S.H., S.T.’s friends. S.T.’s general practitioner also gave evidence as to a letter he had written on S.T.’s behalf to the hospital authorities, which outlined S.T.’s allegations against the first applicant. In respect of the second count, the indecent assault upon V.U., evidence was given by V.U. and by the police officers who had investigated the case. Evidence was then given by two women who alleged that the first applicant had made improper suggestions to them during hypnosis consultations. That evidence was relied on by the prosecution as “similar fact evidence” to support the evidence of S.T. and V.U. As the prosecution had indicated, expert evidence was given as to the effects of hypnosis. The defence was given the opportunity to cross-examine all the witnesses who gave live evidence. The first applicant gave evidence in his own defence. He also called a number of witnesses, who gave evidence as to his good character. 15.In his summing up, the trial judge directed the jury, on two separate occasions, as to how they should regard S.T.’s statement. Firstly, he stated: “It is very important that you [the jury] bear in mind when considering her [S.T.’s] evidence that you have not seen her give evidence; you have not heard her give evidence; and you have not heard her evidence tested in cross-examination [by counsel for Mr Al-Khawaja], who would, undoubtedly, have had a number of questions to put to her.” “It is very important that you [the jury] bear in mind when considering her [S.T.’s] evidence that you have not seen her give evidence; you have not heard her give evidence; and you have not heard her evidence tested in cross-examination [by counsel for Mr Al-Khawaja], who would, undoubtedly, have had a number of questions to put to her.” 16.He later stated: “... bear in mind ... that this evidence was read to you. The allegation is completely denied ... you must take that into account when considering her evidence.” “... bear in mind ... that this evidence was read to you. The allegation is completely denied ... you must take that into account when considering her evidence.” 17.When referring to the evidence of S.T.’s friends, the trial judge reminded the jury that there was an inconsistency between S.T.’s account of the consultation and the account given by S.H. (in her statement S.T. said that the applicant had touched her face and mouth; S.H. gave evidence that it was S.T. herself and not the first applicant who had touched her face and mouth). The trial judge continued: “It is for you to decide the extent to which the evidence of [B.F.] and [S.H.] helps you in deciding whether or not [S.T.] has spoken the truth in her statement. But bear in mind the evidence as to what [S.T.] said to [B.F.] and [S.H.] is not independent evidence as to the truth of her allegations.” “It is for you to decide the extent to which the evidence of [B.F.] and [S.H.] helps you in deciding whether or not [S.T.] has spoken the truth in her statement. But bear in mind the evidence as to what [S.T.] said to [B.F.] and [S.H.] is not independent evidence as to the truth of her allegations.” 18.The trial judge also instructed the jury that they were entitled to consider the evidence of V.U., and of the other two women who had given evidence as to the improper suggestions made by the first applicant, when deciding whether S.T.’s statement was true. However, the jury firstly had to discount the possibility of collusion between the four women. Secondly, they had to ask themselves whether it was reasonable that four people independently making similar accusations could all either be lying or mistaken or have all suffered similar hallucinations or false memory. If the jury thought that incredible, they could be satisfied that S.T. and V.U. had spoken the truth. The trial judge also directed the jury that the greater the similarity between the allegations, the greater the likelihood that the four women were telling the truth. He added that the jury also had to consider whether the women could have consciously or unconsciously been influenced by hearing of the complaints of the others. 19.In the course of their deliberations, on two occasions the jury asked for clarification of points raised in the statement of S.T. On 30 November 2004, the first applicant was convicted by a unanimous verdict of the jury on both counts of indecent assault. He was sentenced to a fifteen-month custodial sentence on the first count and a twelve-month custodial sentence on the second count, to run consecutively. 20.The first applicant appealed against his conviction to the Court of Appeal. The appeal centred on the pre-trial ruling to admit S.T.’s statement as evidence. It was also submitted that, in his summing up, the trial judge did not give adequate directions to the jury as to the consequential disadvantage of this evidence to the first applicant. 21.The appeal was heard and dismissed on 6 September 2005. In its written judgment handed down on 3 November 2005 the Court of Appeal concluded that the first applicant’s right to a fair trial had not been infringed. With regard to the admission in evidence of the statement of S.T., the court held that it was not necessarily incompatible with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention. Relying on Doorson v. the Netherlands (26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II), the court held that the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter of domestic law. It then found: “25.The important factors in the present case are the following. The witness, S.T., could not be examined on behalf of the [first applicant] because she had died. She was the only witness whose evidence went directly to the commission of an indecent assault on her by the appellant. If her statement had been excluded, the prosecution would have had to abandon the first count. The [applicant] was able to attack the accuracy of [S.T.’s] statement by exploring the inconsistencies between it and the witnesses, [B.F.] and [S.H.], and through the expert evidence relating to ‘altered perception’ under hypnosis. The relevant sections of the 1988 Act [see paragraph 41 below] contained provisions designed to protect defendants, which were properly considered by the judge, before the statement was admitted in evidence. Lastly, the tribunal of fact, here the jury, could and should take proper account of the difficulties which the admission of a statement might provide for the [applicant], which should be provided by an appropriate direction to the jury. 26.Where a witness who is the sole witness of a crime has made a statement to be used in its prosecution and has since died, there may be a strong public interest in the admission of the statement in evidence so that the prosecution may proceed. That was the case here. That public interest must not be allowed to override the requirement that the defendant have a fair trial. Like the court in Sellick [see paragraph 48 below] we do not consider that the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights requires the conclusion that in such circumstances the trial will be unfair. The provision in Article 6 § 3 (d) that a person charged shall be able to [have] the witnesses against him examined is one specific aspect of a fair trial: but if the opportunity is not provided, the question is ‘whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way the evidence was taken, were fair’ – Doorson, paragraph 19 [see paragraph 58 below]. This was not a case where the witness had absented himself, whether through fear or otherwise, or had required anonymity, or had exercised a right to keep silent. The reason was death, which has a finality which brings in considerations of its own, as has been indicated at the start of this paragraph.” 26.Where a witness who is the sole witness of a crime has made a statement to be used in its prosecution and has since died, there may be a strong public interest in the admission of the statement in evidence so that the prosecution may proceed. That was the case here. That public interest must not be allowed to override the requirement that the defendant have a fair trial.

The reason was death, which has a finality which brings in considerations of its own, as has been indicated at the start of this paragraph.” 22.Turning to the issue of the trial judge’s summing up, the court stated: “We consider that it would have been better if the judge had stated explicitly that the [first applicant] was potentially disadvantaged by the absence of [S.T.] and that in consequence of the inability to cross-examine her and of the jury to see her, her evidence should carry less weight with them. Nonetheless, in the circumstances of this case it must have been wholly clear to the jury from the directions the judge did give, that this was the purpose of his remarks. We therefore consider that the jury were given an adequate direction as to the consequences of [S.T.’s] statement being in evidence in her absence, and that this is not a factor which might make the [first applicant’s] trial unfair and in breach of Article 6. We should also say that overall the evidence against the [first applicant] was very strong. We were wholly unpersuaded that the verdicts were unsafe.” 23.The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords but certified that a point of law of general public importance was involved in the decision. 24.On 30 November 2005 the first applicant petitioned the House of Lords on the point of law certified by the Court of Appeal. On 7 February 2006 the House of Lords refused the petition. 25.The second applicant was born in 1975. His application arises from his conviction for wounding with intent. The background to that conviction is as follows. 26.On 19 May 2004, S., a member of the Iranian community living in London, was involved in an altercation with some Kurdish men. The second applicant interposed himself between S. and the Kurdish men in order to protect S. In the small hours of the morning of 20 May 2004, S. and the second applicant met again outside an Iranian restaurant in Hammersmith, . The second applicant asked S to have a word with him and led him into a nearby alleyway. The men began discussing the earlier altercation. Although S. denied throwing the first punch, he conceded while giving evidence at the second applicant’s trial that he had punched the second applicant. In the fight, the second applicant pushed S. back and, at this stage, S. became aware of a burning sensation in his back, which proved to be the result of three stab wounds to his back. S. and the second applicant had been face-to-face and S.’s account was that he neither saw the second applicant stab him, nor was he aware of the second applicant going behind him or reaching round his back, so as to stab him. 27.During the fight other men were present, including the Kurdish men from the earlier altercation. A friend of S., another member of the Iranian community called T., was there, as were two of T.’s friends and the second applicant’s uncle. S could not say which of the men were behind him. 28.S. saw a knife lying on the ground and he realised that he had been stabbed. In his evidence at the second applicant’s trial (see paragraph 32 below), he stated that he went to pick it up but that either the second applicant or T. had picked it up and thrown it towards the restaurant. S. assumed that it had been the second applicant who had stabbed him. According to S., the second applicant immediately denied this. He told S. to sit down beside him and attempted to staunch the blood flow from S.’s wounds until an ambulance arrived; when it did, he accompanied S to the hospital. At the hospital, the second applicant told the police that he had seen two black men stab S. 29.When witnesses were questioned at the scene, no one claimed to have seen the second applicant stab S. Two days later, however, T. made a statement to the police that he had seen the second applicant stab S. In his statement, T. recounted that, when the second applicant and S. had begun fighting in the alleyway, T. had tried to separate them. He then saw the second applicant hold S. by the neck, hold up the knife and stab S. twice in the back. As T. moved towards the second applicant, the second applicant tried to stab T. in the neck. According to T., the second applicant then dropped the knife and shouted “don’t tell the police”. 29.When witnesses were questioned at the scene, no one claimed to have seen the second applicant stab S. Two days later, however, T. made a statement to the police that he had seen the second applicant stab S. In his statement, T. recounted that, when the second applicant and S. had begun fighting in the alleyway, T. had tried to separate them. He then saw the second applicant hold S. by the neck, hold up the knife and stab S. twice in the back. As T. moved towards the second applicant, the second applicant tried to stab T. in the neck. According to T., the second applicant then dropped the knife and shouted “don’t tell the police”. 30.On 3 November 2004 the second applicant was arrested and taken to Hammersmith police station. In interview, he denied stabbing S. and again stated that two black men were responsible. He was charged with wounding with intent and also with attempting to pervert the course of justice for telling the police, at the hospital and at the police station, that he had seen two black men stab S. 31.On 25 April 2005 the second applicant’s trial began at Blackfriars Crown Court. That day, he pleaded guilty in respect of the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice but maintained his not guilty plea in respect of the charge of wounding with intent. 31.On 25 April 2005 the second applicant’s trial began at Blackfriars Crown Court. That day, he pleaded guilty in respect of the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice but maintained his not guilty plea in respect of the charge of wounding with intent. 32.S. gave evidence for the prosecution. He recounted how he and the second applicant had fought in the alleyway. After a minute he realised that he had been injured in the back. He had not seen who stabbed him. The second applicant had made him sit down and had covered the wound. S. had asked the second applicant who had stabbed him and the second applicant had denied that it was him. When cross-examined, S. accepted that he had not seen the second applicant go behind him and that they had been face-to-face. He also testified that he had heard someone shout to him “Tell him it was the blacks”; the voice did not belong to the second applicant. 33.After S had given evidence, the prosecution made an application for leave to read T.’s statement pursuant to section 116(2)(e) and (4) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”; see paragraphs 43-45 below). The prosecution argued under the 2003 Act that T. was too fearful to attend trial before the jury and that he should qualify for special measures. The trial judge heard evidence from a police officer conducting the case who testified that the Iranian community was close-knit and that T.’s fear was genuine. T.also gave evidence to the trial judge (but not the jury) from behind a screen. He told the judge that he was in fear for himself and his family because of visits and telephone calls he had received, none of which were said to have been from the second applicant. He did not say who had been responsible for the visits and telephone calls. 34.In ruling that leave should be given for the statement to be read to the jury, the trial judge stated: “I am satisfied in those circumstances upon the criminal standard of proof that this witness is genuinely in fear; and I base that not only on his oral testimony, but also upon my opportunity while he was in the witness box to observe him. I therefore have to go on to consider the questions posed in [section 116(4) of the 2003 Act]. Subsection 4(a) requires me to look at the statement’s contents. I have done so. It is submitted by the defence that they may be unreliable; there being some inconsistencies with the evidence that was given by [S.]. There will always be cases, whether it be oral evidence or evidence that is read, where there are inconsistencies. It is always for the jury to come to a conclusion, based upon submissions of counsel and the evidence that they have heard, as to whether the evidence is reliable or not. And they will receive from me the appropriate warning when the time comes as to how they should view that statement. It is further submitted that in looking at the statement, it is a statement of great importance; in that it is from a person who purports to witness the incident and consequently goes to the heart of the matter. In my view, it is precisely this type of witness who is likely to be put in fear, and consequently that must have been what Parliament had in mind when it enacted this particular section. I therefore have to look, having looked at the contents of the statement, to any risk its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to any party to the proceedings. I am satisfied that there would be an unfairness caused by its exclusion; but I am equally satisfied that no unfairness would be caused by its admission. And in doing so, I have taken into account the words of [the 2003 Act]; in particular how difficult it will be to challenge the statement if the relevant person does not give oral evidence. Challenge of a statement does not always come from cross-examination. Challenge of a statement can be caused by evidence given in rebuttal; by either the defendant, if he chooses to do so, or by any other bystander – and we know that there were some – who were on the street at that time. Consequently I am satisfied that the defendant’s evidence, if he chooses to give it, would be sufficient to rebut and to challenge the evidence that is contained in that statement. I have further considered other relevant factors, and I have also offered to the witness whilst he was in the witness box behind screens the possibility of him giving evidence with the same special measures in place. He told me his position would not change; that he could not give evidence before a jury, and the reason that he could not was because he was in fear. Having taken all those matters into account in those circumstances, I am satisfied that this is the type of case which Parliament envisaged might require a statement to be read.” 35.T.’s witness statement was then read to the jury. Evidence was also given by the doctor who had treated S. at hospital as to the nature of the wound and by a forensic scientist who had tested the blood found on the second applicant’s clothes and confirmed it matched that of S. (though no firm conclusions could be drawn as to how it had been deposited on the clothes). The record of the second applicant’s interview by the police was also tendered by the prosecution (see paragraph 30 above). 36.The second applicant gave evidence in his defence. He stated that he had been present at the earlier altercation with the Kurdish men. When he and S. later met outside the restaurant, he had taken S. by the hand and suggested that they go and talk, but S. had begun to punch him. He had defended himself by grabbing S. by the collar and pushing him. T. had then tried to intervene and a number of other members of the Iranian community had restrained S. T. had been standing between S. and the second applicant and, at this stage, the second applicant noticed the knife on the ground. He had picked it up and thrown it, not knowing at this point that S. had been stabbed. When S blamed him for the stabbing, the second applicant had told him to sit down and had successfully calmed him down. He placed his hand on the wound on S.’s back. S. then appeared to accept that the second applicant had not stabbed him. The second applicant also gave evidence that he had told the police that two black men were responsible because this was what his uncle had told him to say. Finally, the second applicant gave evidence that, before he had been interviewed by the police, T. had told him that he, T., knew that the second applicant had not stabbed S. 36.The second applicant gave evidence in his defence.

Finally, the second applicant gave evidence that, before he had been interviewed by the police, T. had told him that he, T., knew that the second applicant had not stabbed S. 37.The judge, in his summing up, warned the jury about the danger of relying on the evidence of T. He stated: “That evidence, as you know, was read to you under the provisions that allow a witness who is frightened, it is not a question of nerves it is a question of fright, fear, for his statement to be read to you but you must be careful as to how you treat it. It is right, as has been pointed out by the defence, that they were deprived of an opportunity to test that evidence under cross-examination. It is right also that you did not have the advantage of seeing the witness and his demeanour in court. You did not have the opportunity for him to think back and say ‘possibly because of things I saw I put two and two together and made five’, as counsel for the defence invites you to say. In other words, you must always be alert to [the fact] that he could put things that he did see together and come to the wrong conclusion. That is a way of examining the statement. You must ask yourselves ‘can we rely upon this statement? Is it a statement which we find convincing?’ It is only, if you are satisfied so that you are sure, that what is in the statement has accurately depicted what happened that night and what the witness saw, that you could rely upon it. That goes for any witness. It is only if you find that the evidence is compelling and satisfies you, so that you are sure, that you act upon it. So you must always ask yourselves ‘is the statement he made reliable?’ You must bear in mind also, importantly, that it is agreed and acknowledged that it is not the defendant who is responsible for putting the witness in fear.” 38.On 29 April 2005 the second applicant was convicted by a majority verdict of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, for which he was later sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with a term of fifteen months’ imprisonment for the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice to which he had pleaded guilty. 39.The second applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the inability to cross-examine T. infringed his right to a fair trial. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the Crown accepted that T.’s statement was “both important and probative of a major issue in the case ... had it not been admitted the prospect of a conviction would have receded and that of an acquittal advanced”. The court upheld the reasoning of the trial judge, stating that there was available not only cross-examination of other prosecution witnesses but also evidence from the second applicant himself and the potential for evidence from other bystanders in order to prevent unfairness. It was also stated that the trial judge had explicitly warned the jury in detail as to how they should treat this evidence and properly directed them as to how they should consider it in reaching their verdict. Although the second applicant maintained that even a proper direction by the judge could not cure the unfairness, the Court of Appeal held that the jury was informed of all matters necessary to its decision-making process. Leave to appeal on conviction was refused on 24 January 2006. The Court of Appeal did, however, give the second applicant leave to appeal against his sentence and reduced the sentence of nine years’ imprisonment to seven years’ imprisonment. 40.Hearsay evidence is any statement of fact other than one made, of his own knowledge, by a witness in the course of oral testimony (see paragraph20 of the judgment of Lord Phillips in R. v. Horncastle and others, summarised at paragraphs 57 to 62 below). As a general rule it is inadmissible in a criminal case unless there is a common-law rule or statutory provision which allows for its admission. The relevant statutory provisions applicable to each applicant are set in the following section. Those statutory provisions are supplemented by three common-law principles. Firstly, there is an additional discretion at common law for a trial judge to exclude any evidence if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. This, in turn, is supplemented by section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which provides the court with a discretion to exclude evidence if its admission would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the trial that it ought not to be admitted. Secondly, if hearsay evidence is admitted and the jury have heard it, the trial judge, in his summing up, must direct the jury as to the dangers of relying on hearsay evidence. Thirdly, in a jury trial, the jury must receive the traditional direction as to the burden of proof, namely that they must be satisfied of the defendant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.>Primary legislation applicable in Mr Al-Khawaja’s case 41.At the time of the first applicant’s trial, the relevant statutory provisions were to be found in sections 23 to 28 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”). Section 23 of the 1988 Act provides for the admission of first-hand documentary hearsay in a criminal trial: “23. ... a statement made by a person in a document shall be admissible in criminal proceedings as evidence of any fact of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible if— (2)... (a)... the person who made the statement is dead or by reason of his bodily or mental condition unfit to attend as a witness; ... 25.(1)If, having regard to all the circumstances— (a)the Crown Court— (i)on a trial on indictment; (ii)on an appeal from a magistrates’ court; or (iii)on the hearing of an application under section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 (applications for dismissal of charges of fraud transferred from magistrates’ court to Crown Court); or (b)the criminal division of the Court of Appeal; or (c)a magistrates’ court on a trial of an information, is of the opinion that in the interests of justice a statement which is admissible by virtue of section 23 or 24 above nevertheless ought not to be admitted, it may direct that the statement shall not be admitted. (2)Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) above, it shall be the duty of the court to have regard— (a)to the nature and source of the document containing the statement and to whether or not, having regard to its nature and source and to any other circumstances that appear to the court to be relevant, it is likely that the document is authentic; (b)to the extent to which the statement appears to supply evidence which would otherwise not be readily available; (c)to the relevance of the evidence that it appears to supply to any issue which is likely to have to be determined in the proceedings; and (d)to any risk, having regard in particular to whether it is likely to be possible to controvert the statement if the person making it does not attend to give oral evidence in the proceedings, that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to the accused or, if there is more than one, to any of them. 26.Where a statement which is admissible in criminal proceedings by virtue of section 23 or 24 above appears to the court to have been prepared ..., for the purposes— (a)of pending or contemplated criminal proceedings; or (b)of a criminal investigation, the statement shall not be given in evidence in any criminal proceedings without the leave of the court, and the court shall not give leave unless it is of the opinion that the statement ought to be admitted in the interests of justice; and in considering whether its admission would be in the interests of justice, it shall be the duty of the court to have regard— (i)to the contents of the statement; (ii)to any risk, having regard in particular to whether it is likely to be possible to controvert the statement if the person making it does not attend to give oral evidence in the proceedings, that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to the accused or, if there is more than one, to any of them; and (iii)to any other circumstances that appear to the court to be relevant ...” Schedule 2 to the Act allows for the admission of evidence relating to the credibility and consistency of the maker of the statement, where such evidence would have been admissible had he or she given evidence in person, or where the matter could have been put to him or her in cross-examination. The Schedule also provides that, in estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to such a statement regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to its accuracy or otherwise.>Primary legislation applicable in Mr Tahery’s case (a)The Law Commission’s report 42.In its report of April 1997, entitled “Evidence in Criminal Proceedings: Hearsay and Related Topics”, the Law Commission recommended a series of reforms to the law of hearsay in England and Wales, including the provisions contained in the 1988 Act. In addition to recommending clarification of the conditions under which a witness statement could be admitted at trial (including the existing grounds of death and fear), the Commission proposed that there should be a limited discretion to admit hearsay evidence that did not fall within any other statutory or common-law exception (recommendation 28). In its earlier consultation paper, published in January 1995, the Commission had reviewed the case-law of this Court on Article 6 § 3 (d) and concluded that there was a risk of a breach of the Convention where a person stood to be convicted on hearsay evidence alone. The Commission considered that this risk was sufficiently serious to warrant requiring the trial court to stop the case where hearsay is the only evidence of an element of the offence (paragraph 9.5 of the consultation paper). After criticisms of this proposal (principally that it was unduly cautious and was beset with practical difficulties), in its 1997 report the Commission decided not to maintain its proposal (see paragraphs 5.33-5.41 of the report). It concluded instead that the adequate protection would be provided by the safeguards it proposed, in particular its recommendation 47, which proposed giving the trial judge the power to stop a case if hearsay evidence was unconvincing (see paragraph 45 below). (b)The Criminal Justice Act 2003 (b)The Criminal Justice Act 2003 43.Part 11, Chapter 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”) came into force in April 2005. It was intended to reform substantially the law governing the admission of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings on the basis of the draft bill proposed by the Law Commission. Under section 114 of the 2003 Act, hearsay evidence is only admissible in criminal proceedings if one of a number of “gateways” applies. Although it was not relied upon in the second applicant’s case, one such “gateway” is section 114(1)(d) which allows for the admission of hearsay evidence if the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice for it to be admissible. Section114(2) provides: “In deciding whether a statement not made in oral evidence should be admitted under subsection (1)(d), the court must have regard to the following factors (and to any others it considers relevant)— (a)how much probative value the statement has (assuming it to be true) in relation to a matter in issue in the proceedings, or how valuable it is for the understanding of other evidence in the case; (b)what other evidence has been, or can be, given on the matter or evidence mentioned in paragraph (a); (c)how important the matter or evidence mentioned in paragraph (a) is in the context of the case as a whole; (d)the circumstances in which the statement was made; (e)how reliable the maker of the statement appears to be; (f)how reliable the evidence of the making of the statement appears to be; (g)whether oral evidence of the matter stated can be given and, if not, why it cannot; (h)the amount of difficulty involved in challenging the statement; (i)the extent to which that difficulty would be likely to prejudice the party facing it.” (i)the extent to which that difficulty would be likely to prejudice the party facing it.” 44.The “gateway” relied on in the second applicant’s case was section116, which allows for the admission of statements of absent witnesses. Section 116, where relevant, provides: “(1)In criminal proceedings a statement not made in oral evidence in the proceedings is admissible as evidence of any matter stated if— (a)oral evidence given in the proceedings by the person who made the statement would be admissible as evidence of that matter; (b)the person who made the statement (the relevant person) is identified to the court’s satisfaction; and (c)any of the five conditions mentioned in subsection (2) is satisfied. (2)The conditions are— (a)that the relevant person is dead; (b)that the relevant person is unfit to be a witness because of his bodily or mental condition; (c)that the relevant person is outside the and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance; (d)that the relevant person cannot be found although such steps as it is reasonably practicable to take to find him have been taken; (e)that through fear the relevant person does not give (or does not continue to give) oral evidence in the proceedings, either at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement, and the court gives leave for the statement to be given in evidence. (3)For the purposes of subsection (2)(e) ‘fear’ is to be widely construed and (for example) includes fear of the death or injury of another person or of financial loss. (4)Leave may be given under subsection (2)(e) only if the court considers that the statement ought to be admitted in the interests of justice, having regard— (a)to the statement’s contents; (b)to any risk that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to any party to the proceedings (and in particular to how difficult it will be to challenge the statement if the relevant person does not give oral evidence); (c)in appropriate cases, to the fact that a direction under section 19 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 (c. 23) (special measures for the giving of evidence by fearful witnesses etc.) could be made in relation to the relevant person; and (d)to any other relevant circumstances. (5)A condition set out in any paragraph of subsection (2) which is in fact satisfied is to be treated as not satisfied if it is shown that the circumstances described in that paragraph are caused— (a)by the person in support of whose case it is sought to give the statement in evidence; or (b)by a person acting on his behalf; in order to prevent the relevant person giving oral evidence in the proceedings (whether at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement).” in order to prevent the relevant person giving oral evidence in the proceedings (whether at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement).” 45.By section 121 of the 2003 Act, section 116(2)(e) can only be relied upon in respect of first-hand hearsay; it cannot be relied only to allow the admission of multiple hearsay. In addition, section 124 allows the admission of evidence to challenge the credibility of the absent witness, for example through the admission of evidence of his bad character, including previous convictions, a propensity to be untruthful and so on. It also allows the admission of inconsistent statements that the witness has made. Section 124(2) allows the admission of evidence to challenge the credibility of the absent witness in circumstances where it would not be admissible in respect of a live witness, for example when it relates to a collateral issue in the case. Where a case is based wholly or partly on hearsay evidence, section 125 requires the trial judge to stop the case (and either direct an acquittal or discharge the jury) if, considering its importance to the case against the defendant, the hearsay evidence is so unconvincing that a conviction would be unsafe. This enacted the Law Commission’s recommendation 47 (see paragraph 42 above). Section 126 preserves both the common-law discretion and the section 78 discretion of the trial judge to exclude hearsay evidence (see paragraph 40 above). It also provides a statutory discretion to exclude hearsay evidence if the trial judge is satisfied that “the case for excluding it, taking account of the danger that to admit it would result in undue waste of time, substantially outweighs the case for admitting it, taking account of the value of the evidence”.>The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 46.The conditions under which witnesses can give evidence anonymously in criminal proceedings are now regulated by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (“the 2009 Act”). Formerly, this was regulated by similar provisions in the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008, which was enacted following the House of Lords’ judgment in R. v. Davis (see paragraphs 49 and 50 below). Under the 2009 Act, witnesses can only give evidence anonymously when, upon the application of either the prosecution or a defendant in the proceedings, the trial judge makes a “witness anonymity order”. Section 87 requires that the trial judge be informed of the identity of the witness. Sections 88(2)-(6) and 89 lay down the conditions for the making of a witness anonymity order. In deciding whether those conditions are met, the court must have regard, inter alia, to whether evidence given by the witness might be the sole or decisive evidence implicating the defendant (section 89(2)(c)). 47.Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen. Section 6(1) provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.>R. v. Sellick and Sellick 48.This Court’s judgment in Lucà v. Italy (no. 33354/96, § 40, ECHR 2001II) was considered by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Sellick and Sellick [2005] EWCA Crim 651, which concerned two defendants who were alleged to have intimidated witnesses. Leave was given by the trial judge to have the witnesses’ statements read to the jury. The defendants appealed on the ground that the admission of the statements breached Article 6 § 1 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d). The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. In considering the relevant case-law of this Court, at paragraph 50 of its judgment, it stated that what appeared from that case-law were the following propositions: “(i)The admissibility of evidence is primarily for the national law; (ii)Evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing and as a general rule Article [6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] require a defendant to be given a proper and adequate opportunity to challenge and question witnesses; (iii)It is not necessarily incompatible with Article [6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] for depositions to be read and that can be so even if there has been no opportunity to question the witness at any stage of the proceedings. Article [6 § 3 (d)] is simply an illustration of matters to be taken into account in considering whether a fair trial has been held. The reasons for the court holding it necessary that statements should be read and the procedures to counterbalance any handicap to the defence will all be relevant to the issue, whether, where statements have been read, the trial was fair; (iv)The quality of the evidence and its inherent reliability, plus the degree of caution exercised in relation to reliance on it, will also be relevant to the question whether the trial was fair.” The Court of Appeal then stated: “The question is whether there is a fifth proposition to the effect that where the circumstances justify the reading of the statement where the defendant has had no opportunity to question the witness at any stage of the trial process, the statement must not be allowed to be read if it is the sole or decisive evidence against the defendant. Certainly at first sight paragraph 40 of Lucà seems to suggest that in whatever circumstances and whatever counterbalancing factors are present if statements are read then there will be a breach of Article 6, if the statements are the sole or decisive evidence. Furthermore there is some support for that position in the previous authorities. But neither Lucà nor any of the other authorities were concerned with a case where a witness, whose identity was well-known to a defendant, was being kept away by fear, although we must accept that the reference to Mafia-type organisations and the trials thereof in paragraph 40 shows that the court had extreme circumstances in mind.”>R. v.>R. v. 49.In R. v. Davis [2008] UKHL 36, the House of Lords considered an appeal against conviction by a defendant who had been convicted of two counts of murder by shooting. Three witnesses had given evidence at trial identifying the defendant as the gunman. They gave evidence anonymously, testifying behind a screen so that they could be seen by the judge and jury but not the defendant. The House of Lords unanimously allowed the defendant’s appeal. It found that the witnesses’ testimony was inconsistent with the long-established principle of the English common law that, subject to certain exceptions and statutory qualifications, the defendant in a criminal trial should be confronted by his accusers in order that he may cross-examine them and challenge their evidence, a principle which originated in ancient (Lord Bingham at paragraph 5). Moreover, this Court had not set its face absolutely against the admission of anonymous evidence in all circumstances. However, it had said that a conviction should not be based solely or to a decisive extent on anonymous statements. In any event, on the facts in Davis’s case, this Court would have found a violation of Article 6: not only was the anonymous witnesses’ evidence the sole or decisive basis on which Davis had been convicted, but effective cross-examination had been hampered. Moreover, this Court had not set its face absolutely against the admission of anonymous evidence in all circumstances. However, it had said that a conviction should not be based solely or to a decisive extent on anonymous statements. In any event, on the facts in Davis’s case, this Court would have found a violation of Article 6: not only was the anonymous witnesses’ evidence the sole or decisive basis on which Davis had been convicted, but effective cross-examination had been hampered. 50.Lord Mance, concurring in judgment, considered the relevant authorities of this Court on Article 6. Having done so, he doubted that there was an absolute requirement that anonymous testimony should not be the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant. Instead, the extent to which such testimony is decisive might be no more than a very important factor to balance in the scales. He also considered that R. v. Sellick and Sellick (among other authorities) served as a caution against treating the Convention, or apparently general statements by this Court, as containing absolutely inflexible rules. 51.The Chamber judgment of 20 January 2009 in the present cases was considered by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in R. v. Horncastle and others. The case concerned the appeals of four defendants who had been convicted on the basis of statements of absent victims, which were read at trial under section 116 of the 2003 Act. For two of the defendants, the maker of the statement had died. For another two, the witness was too fearful to attend trial. Their appeals were heard together with that of a fifth defendant, Carter, who had been convicted on the basis of business records, which were introduced at his trial. 52.On 22 May 2009 the Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appeals of the first four defendants ([2009] EWCA Crim 964). It accepted that Article 6 § 3 (d) had a content of its own but, given that it did not create any absolute right to have every witness examined, the balance struck by the 2003 Act was legitimate and wholly consistent with the Convention. There could be a very real disadvantage in admitting hearsay evidence and it needed cautious handling. However, having regard to the safeguards contained in the 2003 Act, which were rigorously applied, there would be no violation of Article 6 if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive degree on hearsay evidence. Where the hearsay evidence was demonstrably reliable, or its reliability could properly be tested and assessed, the rights of the defence would be respected, there would be sufficient counterbalancing measures and the trial would be fair. It was not appropriate that there should be a rule that counterbalancing measures could never be sufficient where the evidence was sole or decisive. This had been considered and rejected by the Law Commission and Parliament when it enacted the 2003 Act. 52.On 22 May 2009 the Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appeals of the first four defendants ([2009] EWCA Crim 964).

This had been considered and rejected by the Law Commission and Parliament when it enacted the 2003 Act. 53.There were also principled and practical difficulties with a sole or decisive rule. Firstly, as a principled difficulty, the test assumed that all hearsay evidence was unreliable in the absence of testing in open court, and secondly, it further assumed that the fact-finder (such as the jury) could not be trusted to assess the weight of the evidence. Neither assumption was justified. For the first, the Court of Appeal gave examples of hearsay evidence that would be reliable such as a victim who, before dying, revealed the name of his or her murderer. For the second, the Court of Appeal found that juries were perfectly able to understand the limitations of written statements and, under section 124 of the 2003 Act, would be provided with material about the maker of the statement (see paragraph 45 above). The mere fact that the evidence was an essential link in the chain of evidence against the accused did not alter that conclusion. For example, forensic evidence might depend on work done by unidentified laboratory assistants (and to that extent was hearsay). However, it was not necessary for every member of the laboratory who had worked with the evidence to be called in order for the strength of the evidence to be tested. 53.There were also principled and practical difficulties with a sole or decisive rule.

However, it was not necessary for every member of the laboratory who had worked with the evidence to be called in order for the strength of the evidence to be tested. 54.The court also found that there were practical difficulties with the sole or decisive rule as a test of admissibility of evidence. It observed: “It is clear from the judgment in Al-Khawaja [v. the United Kingdom] that the [European Court of Human Rights] took the view that the error had lain in admitting the hearsay evidence: see in particular paragraphs 37, 40, 42 and 46. Any test of admissibility must be one which can be applied in advance of the giving of the evidence, let alone of the outcome of the trial. A routine test of admissibility of evidence which can only be applied in retrospect, after the outcome of the trial is known, makes the trial process little more than speculative. Judge, jury, witnesses and parties may find themselves engaged in shadow-boxing without knowing whether the solemn result of the trial will stand to be reversed on the grounds that, as things have turned out, the test of admissibility was not met. Nor can any defendant decide how to conduct his case, and indeed whether or not to plead guilty, if he does not know what evidence can and cannot be relied upon. It will no doubt often be possible to identify in advance a case in which the hearsay evidence in question is the sole evidence against the accused. An obvious case is that of the single eyewitness case, with no suggested support from any other source. But this frequently may not be clear from the outset; there may be other evidence which the prosecution intends to present, but which, on hearing, turns out not to incriminate the accused, or is effectively demolished. Conversely, what appears at the outset to be hearsay evidence standing alone may sometimes come to be supported by other material as the evidence develops. A witness may add something of great significance not previously mentioned, or the significance of something always said may become apparent when apparently unconnected other evidence is given. In any case where there is more than one accused jointly charged, it is common experience that the evidence of one may well shed enormous light upon the guilt or innocence of another. So even the concept of ‘sole’ evidence is an impractical test for admissibility. It is, however, the second limb of the suggested test which is apt to cause the greatest difficulty. No one can know what evidence is decisive until the decisionmaking process is over. On no view can it be possible to rule in advance, at the stage when admissibility is in question, which evidence will be decisive ... The application of the test is made the more difficult yet if the meaning of ‘decisive’ is extended to encompass any evidence of which it can be said that, if it were absent, ‘the prospect of a conviction would have receded and that of an acquittal advanced’ (see paragraph 21 of Al-Khawaja). Indeed, if that is the test of what is decisive, virtually all evidence would qualify; evidence which does not, if accepted by the jury, advance the prospect of conviction will ordinarily be excluded as irrelevant.” The Court of Appeal also observed that the test would also be impossible to apply at a trial of two or more defendants, where one defendant sought to introduce hearsay evidence for his defence. In such a case, the trial judge would be bound to allow the defendant to introduce that evidence even if it might also incriminate one of the other defendants and indeed be decisive evidence against that other defendant. The Court of Appeal also observed that the test would also be impossible to apply at a trial of two or more defendants, where one defendant sought to introduce hearsay evidence for his defence. In such a case, the trial judge would be bound to allow the defendant to introduce that evidence even if it might also incriminate one of the other defendants and indeed be decisive evidence against that other defendant. 55.The Court of Appeal also considered that the safeguard in section125 of the 2003 Act (the power of a trial judge to stop the case if the hearsay evidence is unconvincing; see paragraph 45 above) provided for a “proportionate assessment of the reliability” of hearsay evidence and it would not serve justice if that power were to be trammelled by a requirement that it be exercised in every case in which the hearsay evidence were the sole or decisive evidence. Sole or decisive hearsay could be wholly convincing and, equally, evidence which was neither sole nor decisive might have such a potential influence on the jury that the judge would be persuaded that a conviction was unsafe. Where there was a legitimate argument that that hearsay was unconvincing and important to the case, the trial judge was required to make up his own mind as to whether a conviction would be safe; this involved assessing the reliability of the hearsay evidence, its place in the evidence as a whole, the issues in the case as they had emerged, and all the other individual circumstances of the case. Finally, the other safeguards contained in the 2003 Act were rigorously applied and the difficulties faced by defendants when hearsay was admitted were well understood by the courts. The Act did not equate hearsay with first-hand evidence; on the contrary it required cautious handling. 55.The Court of Appeal also considered that the safeguard in section125 of the 2003 Act (the power of a trial judge to stop the case if the hearsay evidence is unconvincing; see paragraph 45 above) provided for a “proportionate assessment of the reliability” of hearsay evidence and it would not serve justice if that power were to be trammelled by a requirement that it be exercised in every case in which the hearsay evidence were the sole or decisive evidence.

Finally, the other safeguards contained in the 2003 Act were rigorously applied and the difficulties faced by defendants when hearsay was admitted were well understood by the courts. The Act did not equate hearsay with first-hand evidence; on the contrary it required cautious handling. 56.The Court of Appeal also gave guidance as to assessing when it would be appropriate to allow hearsay evidence to be introduced because a witness was in fear. There was, in the case-law of this Court, no requirement that the fear had to be attributable to the defendant, and the essential questions were whether there was a justifiable reason for the absence of the witness supported by evidence and whether the evidence was demonstrably reliable or its reliability could be properly tested and assessed. The Court of Appeal added: “It is, however, important that all possible efforts are made to get the witness to court. As is clear, the right to confrontation is a long-standing requirement of the common law and recognised in Article 6 [§ 3 (d)]. It is only to be departed from in the limited circumstances and under the conditions set out in the [2003 Act]. The witness must be given all possible support, but also made to understand the importance of the citizen’s duty, and indeed that the violent and intimidatory will only flourish the more if that duty is not done, whilst they will normally back down in the face of determination that it be performed. For this reason it is of especial importance that assurances are never given to potential witnesses that their evidence will be read. Unless the defendant consents, it is only the court applying the strict conditions of the [2003 Act] based on evidence that can admit such a statement. Any indication, let alone an assurance, can only give rise to an expectation that this will indeed happen, when if it does the impact of the evidence will be diminished and the disadvantage to the accused may result in it not being given at all. It may well be that in the early stage of police enquiries into a prominent crime the investigators need to seek out information on a confidential basis: that is a matter for practical policing and not for us. But no person who is becoming not simply a source of information but a witness should be told that his evidence will be read, or indeed given any indication whatsoever that this is likely. The most that he can be told is that witnesses are expected to be seen at court, that any departure from that principle is exceptional, and that the decision whether to depart from it is one for the judge and not for the police. In the case before us of Marquis and Graham [two of the appellants], as we set out at paragraphs 127 and 132, the judge found that the investigating police officer had significantly contributed to the fear of the witness by referring repeatedly to a notorious local example of witnesses being hunted down, although relocated, and killed. Although notorious, that incident was an extreme and very unusual case. The need for police officers to tender careful advice to potential witnesses in order to discharge their duty of care towards them should not lead to such frightening information being laboured out of defensiveness. Whilst the [2003 Act] requires fear to be construed broadly, it is not to be expected that fear based upon inappropriate assurances by police officers will result in the evidence being read and the case proceeding on the basis of it to the jury. If the evidence can really only be assessed by the jury by seeing the witness, as will often be the case, it may not be admitted. If it is admitted and central to the case, there is a significant possibility that at the end of the trial the judge may have to rule under [section] 125 that a conviction relying upon it would be unsafe.” (b)The judgment of the Supreme Court 57.On 9 December 2009 the United Kingdom Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment ([2009] UKSC 14). Lord Phillips, giving the judgment of the Supreme Court, found that, although domestic courts were required by the Human Rights Act 1998 to take account of the Strasbourg jurisprudence in applying principles that were clearly established, on rare occasions, where a court was concerned that the Strasbourg judgment did not sufficiently appreciate or accommodate some aspect of English law, it might decline to follow the judgment. The Chamber judgment was such a case. 57.On 9 December 2009 the United Kingdom Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment ([2009] UKSC 14). Lord Phillips, giving the judgment of the Supreme Court, found that, although domestic courts were required by the Human Rights Act 1998 to take account of the Strasbourg jurisprudence in applying principles that were clearly established, on rare occasions, where a court was concerned that the Strasbourg judgment did not sufficiently appreciate or accommodate some aspect of English law, it might decline to follow the judgment. The Chamber judgment was such a case. 58.Lord Phillips considered that a defendant should not be immune from conviction where a witness, who had given critical and apparently reliable evidence in a statement, was unavailable to give evidence at trial through death or some other reason. In analysing the relevant case-law of this Court on Article 6 § 3 (d), Lord Phillips concluded that, although this Court had recognised the need for exceptions to the strict application of Article 6 § 3 (d), the manner in which it approved those exceptions resulted in a jurisprudence which lacked clarity. The sole or decisive rule had been introduced into the Strasbourg case-law in Doorson (cited above) without discussion of the underlying principle or full consideration of whether there was justification for imposing the rule as an overriding principle applicable equally to continental and common-law jurisdictions. Indeed, the rule seemed to have been created because, in contrast to the common law, continental systems of criminal procedure did not have a comparable body of jurisprudence or rules governing the admissibility of evidence. 59.Lord Phillips, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, found that the rule would create severe practical difficulties if applied to English criminal procedure. Firstly, it was not easy to apply because it was not clear what was meant by “decisive”: under English criminal procedure no evidence could be admitted unless it was potentially probative and, in theory, any item of probative evidence could make the difference between conviction and acquittal. Secondly, it would be hard enough to apply that test at first instance but it would be impossible for national appellate courts or this Court to decide whether a particular statement was the sole or decisive basis for a conviction. In a jury trial, the only way the rule could be applied would be to exclude all hearsay evidence. 59.Lord Phillips, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, found that the rule would create severe practical difficulties if applied to English criminal procedure. Firstly, it was not easy to apply because it was not clear what was meant by “decisive”: under English criminal procedure no evidence could be admitted unless it was potentially probative and, in theory, any item of probative evidence could make the difference between conviction and acquittal.

In a jury trial, the only way the rule could be applied would be to exclude all hearsay evidence. 60.Lord Phillips also observed: “The sole or decisive test produces a paradox. It permits the court to have regard to evidence if the support that it gives to the prosecution case is peripheral, but not where it is decisive. The more cogent the evidence the less it can be relied upon. There will be many cases where the statement of a witness who cannot be called to testify will not be safe or satisfactory as the basis for a conviction. There will, however, be some cases where the evidence in question is demonstrably reliable. The Court of Appeal has given a number of examples. I will just give one, which is a variant of one of theirs. A visitor to witnesses a hit and run road accident in which a cyclist is killed. He memorises the number of the car, and makes a statement to the police in which he includes not merely the number, but the make and colour of the car and the fact that the driver was a man with a beard. He then returns to his own country, where he is himself killed in a road accident. The police find that the car with the registration number that he provided is the make and colour that he reported and that it is owned by a man with a beard. The owner declines to answer questions as to his whereabouts at the time of the accident. It seems hard to justify a rule that would preclude the conviction of the owner of the car on the basis of the statement of the deceased witness, yet that is the effect of the sole or decisive test.” 61.Lord Phillips instead concluded that the 2003 Act made such a rule unnecessary in English criminal procedure because, if the 2003 Act were observed, there would be no breach of Article 6 § 3 (d) even if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive extent on hearsay evidence. To demonstrate this point, Annex 4 to the judgment analysed a series of cases against other Contracting States where this Court had found a violation of Article 6 § 1 when taken in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d). In each case, had the trial taken place in England and Wales, the witness’s testimony would not have been admissible under the 2003 Act either because the witness was anonymous and absent or because the trial court had not made sufficient enquiries to ensure there was good reason for the witness’s absence. Alternatively, had the evidence been admitted, any conviction would have been quashed on appeal. 61.Lord Phillips instead concluded that the 2003 Act made such a rule unnecessary in English criminal procedure because, if the 2003 Act were observed, there would be no breach of Article 6 § 3 (d) even if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive extent on hearsay evidence.

Alternatively, had the evidence been admitted, any conviction would have been quashed on appeal. 62.Lord Brown delivered a concurring judgment in which he stated: “These appeals are of the utmost importance. If the Strasbourg case-law does indeed establish an inflexible, unqualified principle that any conviction based solely or decisively on evidence adduced from an absent or anonymous witness is necessarily to be condemned as unfair and set aside as contrary to [Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] of the Convention, then the whole domestic scheme for ensuring fair trials – the scheme now enshrined (as to hearsay evidence) in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and (as to anonymous evidence) in the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008 [see paragraph 46 above] – cannot stand and many guilty defendants will have to go free. It is difficult to suppose that the has in fact laid down so absolute a principle as this and, indeed, one exception to it, at least, appears to be acknowledged: the fairness of admitting hearsay evidence from a witness absent as a result of the defendant’s own intimidation. ... Nor can readily be supposed to have intended the sort of practical problems and anomalies identified by the Court of Appeal (paragraphs 61-63 and6871 [of its judgment]) that must inevitably flow from any absolute principle of the kind here contended for. Obviously, the more crucial the evidence is to the proof of guilt, the more scrupulous must the court be to ensure that it can be fairly adduced and is likely to be reliable. In this connection there can be no harm in using the concept of ‘sole or decisive’ so long as it is used broadly – as it is in the 2008 Act with regard to anonymous witnesses and, indeed, in the control order context where it relates rather to the allegations made against the suspect than the evidence adduced in support. Understood and applied inflexibly, however, the concept would involve insoluble problems of detailed interpretation and application. The better view may therefore be that no such absolute principle emerges from the Strasbourg Court’s judgment in Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom ...” 63.Subject to certain statutory exceptions, in Scots criminal law a person cannot be convicted of a crime or statutory offence on the uncorroborated testimony of one witness, however credible (see Morton v. HM Advocate 1938 JC 52, quoted in Campbell v. HM Advocate 2004SLT135). 64.Hearsay is regulated by section 259 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which allows for its admissibility under certain conditions, including when the person who made the statement is dead. Section 259(4) permits evidence to be admitted which is relevant to the credibility of the person as a witness. In N v. HM Advocate 2003 SLT 761 the High Court of Justiciary, sitting as an appeal court, reluctantly reached the conclusion that section 259 deprived the court of the discretion it previously enjoyed at common law to exclude such evidence if it was unreliable. Lord Justice Clerk observed that, notwithstanding section 259, the long-recognised dangers in hearsay evidence remained. He added: “Where a general provision such as [section] 259 applies, there are bound to be cases in the circumstances of which hearsay evidence would be so prejudicial to the fairness of the trial that the only just and proper course would be to exclude it. This, I think, is such a case. I am not impressed by the three safeguards to which the trial judge referred (HMAdvocate v. N, at p. 437C–E). The requirement of corroboration is a neutral consideration. It is a safeguard that applies to prosecution evidence in any form. I cannot see what worthwhile safeguard the principle of corroboration provides if the primary evidence sought to be corroborated is per se unfair to the accused. Moreover, the leading of evidence bearing upon the credibility of the maker of the hearsay statement may be at most an exercise in damage limitation where clearly prejudicial evidence has already been led. As for the safeguard of the judge’s directions, I think that there may be cases where the hearsay evidence is so prejudicial that no direction, however strong, could make adequate amends for the unfairness of its having been admitted. ... In English provisions governing the admissibility of a statement made in a document, Parliament has expressly conferred a discretion on the court to exclude such a statement if it is of the opinion that in the interests of justice it ought not to be admitted. One specific consideration to which the court must have regard is the risk that the admission of the evidence will result in unfairness to the accused (Criminal Justice Act 1988, [sections] 25(1), 25(2)(d) and 26(ii); cf. R. v. Gokal). These, in my view, are prudent provisions. If provisions of this kind had been available to the trial judge in this case, they could have enabled him to exclude the hearsay at the outset.” 65.The High Court of Justiciary also considered the compatibility of the introduction of the evidence of an absent witness with Article 6 § 3 (d) in McKenna v. HM Advocate. In that case, a murder trial, the prosecution sought to introduce statements made to the police by a possible co-accused who had since died. In a previous ruling given before trial (2000 SLT 508), the High Court of Justiciary, sitting as an appeal court, had found that it was only in extreme circumstances that an accused could contend in advance of trial that the introduction of the hearsay evidence would be so prejudicial to the prospects of a fair trial that the court could determine the issue in advance. It therefore allowed the trial to proceed. When the statements were introduced at trial and the accused was convicted, he appealed against his conviction. In its judgment dismissing the appeal (2003 SLT 508), the High Court of Justiciary found that, while the statements were important evidence, having regard to the other evidence led at trial (which included admissions by the accused and forensic evidence), it could not be said that the appellant’s conviction was based to a decisive extent on them. The jury had also been adequately and satisfactorily directed as to how to approach the absent witness’s statement. A similar conclusion was reached by the same court in HM Advocate v. M 2003 SLT 1151. 65.The High Court of Justiciary also considered the compatibility of the introduction of the evidence of an absent witness with Article 6 § 3 (d) in McKenna v. HM Advocate. In that case, a murder trial, the prosecution sought to introduce statements made to the police by a possible co-accused who had since died.

The jury had also been adequately and satisfactorily directed as to how to approach the absent witness’s statement. A similar conclusion was reached by the same court in HM Advocate v. M 2003 SLT 1151. 66.The compatibility of the admission of hearsay evidence with Article6 § 3 (d) was further considered by the High Court of Justiciary in Campbell v. HM Advocate (cited above). The court observed that, in the relevant case-law of this Court, many of the violations of Article 6 § 3 (d) which had been found had arisen in jurisdictions which did not apply the Scots law rule of corroboration: “Most of the situations in which it has been held by the court that there had been a violation of [Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)] could not arise in Scotland. Against the requirement for corroboration of all crucial facts, a conviction could not be based solely on the evidence of a single witness, whether in primary or in secondary form. Violations of the Convention right have been established where the principal witness against the accused has not been made available for questioning or, in circumstances where there have been a number of principal witnesses, where none of them has been made so available. No case was cited to us in which a violation was held to have occurred in circumstances where the accused had had an opportunity to question or have questioned the complainer or other direct or central witness and other supporting evidence was in statement form. ‘To a decisive extent’, as used in the European authorities, appears to be concerned with the significance of the evidence as a matter of weight. It is not concerned with any rule that a conviction cannot be based on a single source of evidence. The fact that the hearsay is required to meet the rule about corroboration does not of itself render that hearsay ‘decisive’ in the European sense. In these circumstances we are not persuaded that in every case in which hearsay evidence is a necessary ingredient of the Crown’s corroborated proof there will be a violation of [Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)]. It will, however, be necessary for the trial judge to address, in the context of the whole evidence in the case, the significance of any hearsay evidence relied on by the Crown and to take appropriate action to ensure that the accused’s entitlement to a fair trial is not violated thereby.” 67.The court added that, in directing a jury, the guidance given by the Lord Justice Clerk in the case of N v. HM Advocate (cited above), should be borne in mind. The High Court allowed the appeal of the first appellant in the case of Campbell (cited above) because of the inadequacy of the trial judge’s direction to the jury. It dismissed the second appellant’s appeal in so far as it related to Article 6 of the Convention, finding that the hearsay evidence was not decisive and that the principal evidence against him came from a witness who had testified in court. 68.Campbell was applied in HM Advocate v. Johnston 2004 SLT 1005 where, in a ruling given during the trial, the Lord Ordinary allowed the admission of a witness statement made to the police by a witness who subsequently died before trial; the statement was admissible, inter alia, because it could not be “decisive”. In Humphrey v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC 30, the High Court of Justiciary observed that it had “great difficulty” in understanding the meaning of the word “decisive” in the context of a case based on circumstantial evidence but, in that case, the evidence in the form of a police statement of a witness who had died was not “remotely decisive” and there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction without it. Similar results were reached in Allison v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC 63, and Harkins v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC69. 69.In its March 2010 Consultation Paper on Hearsay in Civil and Criminal Cases, the Law Reform Commission of Ireland provisionally recommended that, subject to existing common law and statutory inclusionary exceptions, hearsay should continue to be excluded in criminal proceedings. It also provisionally recommended that there should be no statutory introduction of a residual discretion to include hearsay evidence and that the concepts of reliability and necessity should not form the basis for reform of the hearsay rule because they lacked clarity. 70.The Commission also noted: “Article 38.1 of the Constitution of Ireland protects the right to cross-examination and that the free admissibility of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings would infringe this constitutionally protected right. There are dangers associated with allowing evidence of unavailable witnesses: it undermines the defendant’s right to a fair trial and creates the potential of miscarriages of justice arising if evidence adduced from the following categories of witnesses is admitted: Where the witness is dead (with the exception of dying declarations); Where a witness because of a bodily or mental infirmity cannot give evidence; Where the witness is outside of the jurisdiction; Where the witness cannot be found.” 71.The Commission declined to recommend that the statutory scheme in England and Wales and in particular section 114 of the 2003 Act, be adopted in . It observed: “This model of reform relaxes the rule in such a manner as to potentially render the rule against hearsay redundant. The categories of admissible hearsay under this model are extended significantly and, in light of the constitutional protection afforded to the right to cross-examination, the Commission is of the provisional opinion that to allow in untested evidence from frightened and unavailable witnesses would undermine this right. The Commission notes that it has provisionally recommended that the courts should retain a discretion to develop the hearsay rule if the necessity exists.” The Commission also found that (subject to possible reservations concerning the ultimate outcome in the present cases), the case-law of this Court appeared broadly in line with the approach taken in Irish law. 72.A strict approach to the exclusion of out-of-court statements has always been taken by the Australian courts (see, for example, Bannon v. The Queen (1995) 185 CLR 1). 73.The admission of hearsay in federal criminal proceedings in is now regulated by the Evidence Act 1995. Section 65 of the Act allows the admission of evidence as to previous representations (for example statements) when a witness is not available to give evidence about an “asserted fact”. Such evidence will be admissible, inter alia, when: (i) the representation was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication (section 65(2)(b)); or (ii) when the representation was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation was reliable (section 65(2)(c)). 74.The use of these provisions to admit the statement of a witness who died before trial was considered by the Federal Court of Australia in Williams v. The Queen (2000) 119 A Crim R 490. The court found that, in the circumstances of the case, the statement made to the police was not sufficiently reliable, particularly when the witness had reasons to tell the police what they wanted to hear. Equivalent statutory provisions were considered by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Harris v. The Queen (2005) 158 A Crim R 454, where the deceased complainant’s statement was found to be sufficiently reliable to be admitted, given that, inter alia, the complainant knew that the police would interview other witnesses in the case. 75.The law of hearsay in Canada has been reformed as a result of three principal decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, which created a “principled approach” to the admissibility of hearsay evidence. 75.The law of hearsay in Canada has been reformed as a result of three principal decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, which created a “principled approach” to the admissibility of hearsay evidence. 76.Firstly, in R. v. Khan [1990] 2 SCR 531, the Supreme Court found that the trial judge had erred in refusing to allow the victim, a three-and-a-half-year-old girl who alleged that she had been sexually assaulted, to give unsworn evidence and his refusal to allow the Crown to introduce statements the child had made to her mother fifteen minutes after the assault. If unsworn evidence could not be given there would be a danger that offences against very young children could never be prosecuted. In respect of the statements to the mother, the Supreme Court found that it was appropriate to take a more flexible but “principled” approach to hearsay. Despite the need for caution, hearsay could be admitted where the two general requirements of necessity and reliability were met. In determining admissibility the trial judge was required to have regard to the need to safeguard the interests of the accused. Concerns as to the credibility of the evidence remained to be addressed by submissions as to the weight to be accorded to it and submissions as to the quality of any corroborating evidence. 77.Secondly, in R. v. Smith [1992] 2 SCR 915 the Court approved the “principled approach” taken in Khan and found that two telephone calls made by the deceased to her mother shortly before her death were admissible. However, the mother’s evidence as to the contents of a third telephone call should have not been admitted as the conditions under which that call was made did not provide the “circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness” which would justify its admission without the possibility of cross-examination. 77.Secondly, in R. v. Smith [1992] 2 SCR 915 the Court approved the “principled approach” taken in Khan and found that two telephone calls made by the deceased to her mother shortly before her death were admissible. However, the mother’s evidence as to the contents of a third telephone call should have not been admitted as the conditions under which that call was made did not provide the “circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness” which would justify its admission without the possibility of cross-examination. 78.Khan and Smith were followed in R. v. Rockey [1996] 3 SCR 829. The Supreme Court was satisfied that any reasonable trial judge would have found it necessary to admit pre-trial statements made by a child, who was fiveyears old at trial, in which he complained that he had been sexually assaulted. It was observed by McLachlin J (concurring in judgment) that the case against the appellant was strong: the child’s statements were entirely consistent and supported, inter alia, by medical evidence and evidence of behavioural changes in him after the assault and the absence of any plausible explanation of someone other than the appellant perpetrating the assault. 79.The third and most significant development in the Supreme Court’s case-law was its judgment in R. v. Khewalon [2006] 2 SCR 787, which took a stricter approach to reliability. The case concerned a complaint of assault made by an elderly resident at a retirement home against one of the home’s employees. The patient, S., gave the police a videotaped statement; the statement was unsworn. After S.’s statement other residents came forward to give statements that they too had been assaulted by the accused. By the time of trial, all those who had made statements, including S, had either died or were no longer competent to testify. Some of the statements were admitted by the trial judge because of the striking similarity between them. The Court of Appeal for excluded all the statements and acquitted the accused. The Supreme Court dismissed the Crown’s appeal from that decision and affirmed the acquittal. The Supreme Court clarified its previous case-law on reliability and stated that the reliability requirement would generally be met by showing: (i) that there was no real concern about whether the statement was true or not because of the circumstances in which it came about; or (ii) that no real concern arose because the truth and accuracy of the statement could nonetheless be sufficiently tested by means other than cross-examination. It was for the trial judge to make a preliminary assessment of the “threshold” reliability of the statement and to leave the ultimate determination of its worth to the fact-finder/jury. All relevant factors had to be considered by the trial judge including, in appropriate cases, the presence of supporting or contradictory evidence. Charron J, giving the unanimous judgment of the court, stated (at paragraph49 of the judgment): “In some cases, because of the circumstances in which it came about, the contents of the hearsay statement may be so reliable that contemporaneous cross-examination of the declarant would add little if anything to the process. In other cases, the evidence may not be so cogent but the circumstances will allow for sufficient testing of evidence by means other than contemporaneous cross-examination. In these circumstances, the admission of the evidence will rarely undermine trial fairness. However, because trial fairness may encompass factors beyond the strict inquiry into necessity and reliability, even if the two criteria are met, the trial judge has the discretion to exclude hearsay evidence where its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.” 80.The court concluded that S.’s statements were not admissible. It observed that the charges against Khelawon in respect of S. were “entirely based” on the truthfulness of the allegations contained in S.’s statements (paragraph 101 of the judgment). The absence of any opportunity to cross-examine him had a bearing on the question of reliability and there were no adequate substitutes for testing the evidence. The principled exceptions to the hearsay rule did not provide a vehicle for founding a conviction on the basis of a police statement, videotaped or otherwise, without more (paragraph 106 of the judgment). Nor could the reliability requirement be met by relying on the inherent trustworthiness of the statement; this was not a case such as Khan where the cogency of the evidence was such that it would be pedantic to insist upon testing by cross-examination. S. was elderly and frail; his mental capacity was at issue and there was medical evidence that his injuries could have arisen from a fall. It was also not clear that he had understood the consequences of his statement for the accused. In the circumstances, S.’s unavailability for cross-examination posed significant limitations on the accused’s ability to test the evidence and, in turn, on the trier of fact’s ability to properly assess its worth. 81.In its report of November 2009, the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong proposed substantial reforms to the admission of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings in that jurisdiction. It proposed that the present rule in Hong Kong against the admission of hearsay evidence should be retained but there should be greater scope to admit hearsay evidence in specific circumstances. The Commission rejected the English statutory scheme contained in the 2003 Act, observing that Hong Kong had none of the statutory mechanisms for excluding hearsay which applied in England and Wales, such as section 126(1) of the 2003 Act and section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (see paragraphs 40 and 45 above). The Commission also observed that grounds for admitting hearsay under section 116 of the 2003 Act, although offering a fair degree of certainty and consistency in decision-making, had “an over-inclusive effect by allowing in all types of relevant evidence, including unreliable hearsay evidence” (paragraph 8.25 of the report). The Commission instead proposed a model of reform, which was based on the approach taken by the New Zealand Law Commission (see paragraph82 below) and the Canadian courts since Khelawon. It recommended that hearsay evidence should be admissible, inter alia, if the trial judge was satisfied that it was necessary to admit the hearsay evidence and that it was reliable. Assessment of reliability by a trial judge should include consideration of whether the hearsay evidence was supported by other admissible evidence. The Commission also recommended that, at any stage of criminal proceedings after hearsay evidence had been admitted, the court should have the power to direct the acquittal of the accused if the trial judge considered that it would be unsafe to convict. In reaching that decision, the court should have regard, inter alia, to the importance of such evidence to the case against the accused. The Commission also found that these recommendations meant that its model of reform would comply with the Chamber judgment in the present cases. 82.The New Zealand Law Commission, in its 1999 Report on Evidence, recommended that the admissibility of hearsay should be based on two considerations: reliability and necessity. That recommendation was enacted in the Evidence Act 2006, which came into force in 2007. Section 18(1) of the Act provides: “A hearsay statement is admissible in any proceeding if— (a)the circumstances relating to the statement provide reasonable assurance that the statement is reliable; and (b)either— (i)the maker of the statement is unavailable as a witness; or (ii)the Judge considers that undue expense or delay would be caused if the maker of the statement were required to be a witness.” (ii)the Judge considers that undue expense or delay would be caused if the maker of the statement were required to be a witness.” 83.“Circumstances” for these purposes are defined in section 16(1) as including: (a) the nature of the statement; (b) the contents of the statement; (c) the circumstances that relate to the making of the statement; (d) any circumstances that relate to the veracity of the person; and (e) any circumstances that relate to the accuracy of the observation of the person. 84.Section 8(1) of the Act provides that evidence must be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the risk that the evidence will (a) have an unfairly prejudicial effect on the proceeding; or (b) needlessly prolong the proceeding. Section 8(2) provides that in determining whether the probative value of evidence is outweighed by the risk that the evidence will have an unfairly prejudicial effect on a criminal proceeding, the judge must take into account the right of the defendant to offer an effective defence. 85.Although jury trials are no longer used in , it too has substantially reformed its law of hearsay. Section 3(4) of the Law of Evidence Amendment Act 45 of 1988 defines hearsay as evidence, whether oral or in writing, the probative value of which depends upon the credibility of any person other than the person giving evidence. By section 3(1) such hearsay evidence is not admissible unless (i) it is admitted by consent; (ii) the person upon whose credibility the evidence depends testifies; or (iii) the court is of the opinion that the evidence should be admitted in the interests of justice. Section 3(1)(c) provides that, in forming its opinion, the court must have regard to: (i) the nature of the proceedings; (ii) the nature of the evidence; (iii)the purpose for which the evidence is tendered; (iv) the probative value of the evidence; (v) the reason why the evidence is not given by the person upon whose credibility the probative value of such evidence depends; (vi)any prejudice to a party which the admission of such evidence might entail; and (vii) any factor which should in the opinion of the court be taken into account. 85.Although jury trials are no longer used in , it too has substantially reformed its law of hearsay. Section 3(4) of the Law of Evidence Amendment Act 45 of 1988 defines hearsay as evidence, whether oral or in writing, the probative value of which depends upon the credibility of any person other than the person giving evidence. By section 3(1) such hearsay evidence is not admissible unless (i) it is admitted by consent; (ii) the person upon whose credibility the evidence depends testifies; or (iii) the court is of the opinion that the evidence should be admitted in the interests of justice. Section 3(1)(c) provides that, in forming its opinion, the court must have regard to: (i) the nature of the proceedings; (ii) the nature of the evidence; (iii)the purpose for which the evidence is tendered; (iv) the probative value of the evidence; (v) the reason why the evidence is not given by the person upon whose credibility the probative value of such evidence depends; (vi)any prejudice to a party which the admission of such evidence might entail; and (vii) any factor which should in the opinion of the court be taken into account. 86.In State v. Ramavhale [1996] ZASCA 14, the Supreme Court observed that, notwithstanding the wording of section 3(1), there remained an “intuitive reluctance to permit untested evidence to be used against an accused in a criminal case”. It also endorsed previous authority that a court should “hesitate long” in admitting or relying on hearsay evidence which plays a decisive or even significant part in convicting an accused, unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. Despite the reforms enacted by section 3(1), the Supreme Court found that reliability was a factor that should continue to be considered in determining the admissibility of hearsay. Moreover, in that case, in assessing what prejudice would arise to the accused if the hearsay were admitted, the trial judge had erred in relying upon the fact that the accused had other avenues open to him to counter the evidence, one of which was to give evidence himself; the logical conclusion of this approach was that the State, by introducing “flimsy” hearsay could force the accused to testify in a case where the absence of direct evidence was such that he would be entitled not to testify. Compelling reasons for admitting hearsay evidence, even though it was decisive, were found to exist in State v. Ndhlovu and others [2002] ZASCA70, not least because the guarantees as to the reliability of the evidence were high and the hearsay evidence interlinked powerfully with the other evidence in the case. The concerns expressed in Ramavhale as to admitting or relying on hearsay evidence which played a decisive or even significant part in convicting an accused were reiterated by the Supreme Court in State v. Libazi and others [2010] ZASCA 91, State v. Mpungose and another [2011] ZASCA 60, and State v. Mamushe [2007] ZASCA 58. In the latter, the Supreme Court observed that it stood to reason that a hearsay statement which would only serve to complete a “mosaic pattern” would be more readily admitted than one which was destined to become a vital part of the State’s case. 87.The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America guarantees the accused in all criminal prosecutions the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him (“the confrontation clause”). In Ohio v. Roberts 448 US 56 (1980) the Supreme Court of the United States of America held that evidence with “particularized guarantees of trustworthiness” was admissible without confrontation. That was overruled in Crawford v.Washington 541 US 36 (2004), where the court ruled that the confrontation clause applied to all evidence which was testimonial in nature and there was no basis in the Sixth Amendment for admitting evidence only on the basis of its reliability. Where testimonial statements were at issue, the only indicium of reliability which was sufficient was the one prescribed by the Constitution: confrontation. Consequently, testimonial evidence was thus inadmissible unless the witness appeared at trial or, if the witness was unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination (see also Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts 129 SCt 2527 (2009), and Bullcoming v. New Mexico 131 SCt 2705 (2011)). The right to confront witnesses will be forfeited if it can be demonstrated that the defendant has frightened the witness into not testifying (see Davis v.Washington 547 US 813 (2006), and Giles v. California 554 US 353 (2008).",2011,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY ASSESSED THE IMPACT THAT THE DEFENDANT’S INABILITY TO EXAMINE A WITNESS HAS HAD ON THE OVERALL FAIRNESS OF HIS TRIAL. IT HAS ALWAYS CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UNTESTED EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DEFENDANT’S RIGHTS HAVE BEEN UNACCEPTABLY RESTRICTED (SEE, AS EARLY EXAMPLES, UNTERPERTINGER, CITED ABOVE, AND BRICMONT V. BELGIUM, 7 JULY 1989, SERIES A NO. 158; AND, MORE RECENTLY, KORNEV AND KARPENKO V. UKRAINE, NO. 17444/04, §§ 54-57, 21 OCTOBER 2010; CAKA V. ALBANIA, NO. 44023/02, §§ 112-16, 8 DECEMBER 2009; GUILLOURY V. FRANCE, NO. 62236/00, §§ 57-62, 22 JUNE 2006; AND A.M. V. ITALY; KRASNIKI; LUCÀ; AND SAÏDI, ALL CITED ABOVE).
THE COMMISSION HAD TAKEN THE SAME APPROACH IN ITS CASE-LAW (SEE, AMONG THE EARLIEST CASES OF THE COMMISSION, X. V. AUSTRIA, NO. 4428/70, COMMISSION DECISION OF 1 JUNE 1972, COLLECTION 40, P. 1; X. V. BELGIUM, NO. 8417/78, COMMISSION DECISION OF 4 MAY 1979, DECISIONS AND REPORTS (DR) 16, P. 205; X. V. GERMANY, NO. 8414/78, COMMISSION DECISION OF 4 JULY 1979, DR 17, P. 231; AND S. V. GERMANY, NO. 8945/80, COMMISSION DECISION OF 13 DECEMBER 1983, DR 39, P. 43).
AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THE COURT HAS ALWAYS INTERPRETED ARTICLE 6 § 3 IN THE CONTEXT OF AN OVERALL EXAMINATION OF THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS. (SEE, AS A RECENT AUTHORITY, SALDUZ V. TURKEY [GC], NO. 36391/02, § 50, ECHR 2008).
144.  TRADITIONALLY, WHEN EXAMINING COMPLAINTS UNDER ARTICLE 6 § 1, THE COURT HAS CARRIED OUT ITS EXAMINATION OF THE OVERALL FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS BY HAVING REGARD TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE WAY IN WHICH STATUTORY SAFEGUARDS HAVE BEEN APPLIED, THE EXTENT TO WHICH PROCEDURAL OPPORTUNITIES WERE AFFORDED TO THE DEFENCE TO COUNTER HANDICAPS THAT IT LABOURED UNDER AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PROCEEDINGS AS A WHOLE HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED BY THE TRIAL JUDGE (SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, JOHN MURRAY, CITED ABOVE).
145.  ALSO, IN CASES CONCERNING THE WITHHOLDING OF EVIDENCE FROM THE DEFENCE IN ORDER TO PROTECT POLICE SOURCES, THE COURT HAS LEFT IT TO THE DOMESTIC COURTS TO DECIDE WHETHER THE RIGHTS OF THE DEFENCE SHOULD CEDE TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND HAS CONFINED ITSELF TO VERIFYING WHETHER THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED BY THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES SUFFICIENTLY COUNTERBALANCE THE LIMITATIONS ON THE DEFENCE WITH APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS. THE FACT THAT CERTAIN EVIDENCE WAS NOT MADE AVAILABLE TO THE DEFENCE WAS NOT CONSIDERED AUTOMATICALLY TO LEAD TO A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 (SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, ROWE AND DAVIS V. THE UNITED KINGDOM [GC], NO. 28901/95, ECHR 2000II). SIMILARLY, IN SALDUZ (CITED ABOVE, § 50), THE COURT REITERATED THAT THE RIGHT TO LEGAL ASSISTANCE, SET OUT IN ARTICLE 6 § 3 (C) WAS ONE ELEMENT, AMONG OTHERS, OF THE CONCEPT OF A FAIR TRIAL IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 6 § 1.
146.  THE COURT IS OF THE VIEW THAT THE SOLE OR DECISIVE RULE SHOULD ALSO BE APPLIED IN A SIMILAR MANNER. IT WOULD NOT BE CORRECT, WHEN REVIEWING QUESTIONS OF FAIRNESS, TO APPLY THIS RULE IN AN INFLEXIBLE MANNER. NOR WOULD IT BE CORRECT FOR THE COURT TO IGNORE ENTIRELY THE SPECIFICITIES OF THE PARTICULAR LEGAL SYSTEM CONCERNED AND, IN PARTICULAR ITS RULES OF EVIDENCE, NOTWITHSTANDING JUDICIAL DICTA THAT MAY HAVE SUGGESTED OTHERWISE (SEE, FOR INSTANCE, LUCÀ, CITED ABOVE, § 40). TO DO SO WOULD TRANSFORM THE RULE INTO A BLUNT AND INDISCRIMINATE INSTRUMENT THAT RUNS COUNTER TO THE TRADITIONAL WAY IN WHICH THE COURT APPROACHES THE ISSUE OF THE OVERALL FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS, NAMELY TO WEIGH IN THE BALANCE THE COMPETING INTERESTS OF THE DEFENCE, THE VICTIM, AND WITNESSES, AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
(C)  GENERAL CONCLUSION ON THE SOLE OR DECISIVE RULE
(C)  GENERAL CONCLUSION ON THE SOLE OR DECISIVE RULE
147.  THE COURT THEREFORE CONCLUDES THAT, WHERE A HEARSAY STATEMENT IS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST A DEFENDANT, ITS ADMISSION AS EVIDENCE WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY RESULT IN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1. AT THE SAME TIME, WHERE A CONVICTION IS BASED SOLELY OR DECISIVELY ON THE EVIDENCE OF ABSENT WITNESSES, THE COURT MUST SUBJECT THE PROCEEDINGS TO THE MOST SEARCHING SCRUTINY. BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF THE ADMISSION OF SUCH EVIDENCE, IT WOULD CONSTITUTE A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR TO BALANCE IN THE SCALES, TO USE THE WORDS OF LORD MANCE IN R. V. DAVIS (SEE PARAGRAPH 50 ABOVE), AND ONE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS, INCLUDING THE EXISTENCE OF STRONG PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS. THE QUESTION IN EACH CASE IS WHETHER THERE ARE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS IN PLACE, INCLUDING MEASURES THAT PERMIT A FAIR AND PROPER ASSESSMENT OF THE RELIABILITY OF THAT EVIDENCE TO TAKE PLACE. THIS WOULD PERMIT A CONVICTION TO BE BASED ON SUCH EVIDENCE ONLY IF IT IS SUFFICIENTLY RELIABLE GIVEN ITS IMPORTANCE IN THE CASE.
(D)  PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS CONTAINED IN THE 1988 AND 2003 ACTS
148.  THE COURT WILL THEREFORE EXAMINE THE COUNTERBALANCING MEASURES IN PLACE IN ENGLISH LAW AT THE RELEVANT TIME. THE COURT OBSERVES THAT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE 1988 AND 2003 ACTS THE ABSENCE OF WITNESSES MUST BE JUSTIFIED AND FALL WITHIN ONE OF THE DEFINED CATEGORIES (SEE SECTION 23 OF THE 1988 ACT AND SECTION 116 OF THE 2003 ACT AT PARAGRAPHS 41 AND 44 ABOVE). WHATEVER THE REASONS FOR THE ABSENCE OF A WITNESS, THE ADMISSION OF STATEMENTS OF A WITNESS WHO IS NOT ONLY ABSENT BUT ANONYMOUS IS NOT ADMISSIBLE.
MOREOVER, WHERE THE ABSENCE IS DUE TO FEAR, UNDER THE 2003 ACT, THE TRIAL JUDGE MAY ONLY GIVE LEAVE IF HE CONSIDERS THE ADMISSION OF THE STATEMENT TO BE IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE AND HE MUST DECIDE WHETHER SPECIAL MEASURES CAN BE PUT IN PLACE TO ALLOW THE WITNESS TO GIVE LIVE EVIDENCE. IN SUCH A CASE, THE TRIAL JUDGE MUST HAVE REGARD TO THE DIFFICULTY FACED BY THE DEFENDANT IN CHALLENGING THE WITNESS STATEMENT IF THE MAKER OF THE STATEMENT IS NOT CALLED.
149.  THE 2003 ACT ALSO PROVIDES THAT, WHATEVER THE REASON FOR THE ABSENCE OF A WITNESS, EVIDENCE RELEVANT TO THE CREDIBILITY OR CONSISTENCY OF THE MAKER OF THE STATEMENT MAY BE ADMITTED EVEN WHERE THE EVIDENCE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ADMISSIBLE HAD THE WITNESS GIVEN EVIDENCE IN PERSON. THE TRIAL JUDGE RETAINS A SPECIFIC DISCRETION TO REFUSE TO ADMIT A HEARSAY STATEMENT IF SATISFIED THAT THE CASE FOR ITS EXCLUSION SUBSTANTIALLY OUTWEIGHS THE CASE FOR ADMITTING IT. OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE IS THE REQUIREMENT UNDER THE 2003 ACT THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE SHOULD STOP THE PROCEEDINGS IF SATISFIED AT THE CLOSE OF THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION THAT THE CASE AGAINST THE ACCUSED IS BASED “WHOLLY OR PARTLY” ON A HEARSAY STATEMENT ADMITTED UNDER THE 2003 ACT, PROVIDED HE OR SHE IS ALSO SATISFIED THAT THE STATEMENT IN QUESTION IS SO UNCONVINCING THAT, CONSIDERING ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE CASE AGAINST THE ACCUSED, A CONVICTION WOULD BE UNSAFE.
150.  THE COURT ALSO NOTES THAT, IN ADDITION TO THE SAFEGUARDS CONTAINED IN EACH ACT, SECTION 78 OF THE POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT 1984 PROVIDES A GENERAL DISCRETION TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE IF ITS ADMISSION WOULD HAVE SUCH AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FAIRNESS OF THE TRIAL THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE ADMITTED. FINALLY, THE COMMON LAW REQUIRES A TRIAL JUDGE TO GIVE THE JURY THE TRADITIONAL DIRECTION ON THE BURDEN OF PROOF, AND DIRECT THEM AS TO THE DANGERS OF RELYING ON A HEARSAY STATEMENT.
151.  THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THE SAFEGUARDS CONTAINED IN THE 1988 AND 2003 ACTS, SUPPORTED BY THOSE CONTAINED IN SECTION 78 OF THE POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT AND THE COMMON LAW, ARE, IN PRINCIPLE, STRONG SAFEGUARDS DESIGNED TO ENSURE FAIRNESS. IT REMAINS TO BE EXAMINED HOW THESE SAFEGUARDS WERE APPLIED IN THE PRESENT CASES.
4.  THE PRESENT CASES
152.  IN TURNING TO THE PRESENT CASES, THE COURT BEGINS BY OBSERVING THAT, IN THE COURSE OF THE HEARING BEFORE THE GRAND CHAMBER, A QUESTION WAS PUT TO THE PARTIES AS TO WHETHER IT WAS ACCEPTED THAT THE TESTIMONY OF S.T. WAS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE EVIDENCE IN RESPECT OF MR AL-KHAWAJA AND THAT THE TESTIMONY OF T. WAS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE EVIDENCE IN RESPECT OF MR TAHERY. IN REPLY TO THAT QUESTION, THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTED FROM THE POSITION THEY HAD TAKEN BEFORE THE CHAMBER AND SUBMITTED THAT NEITHER S.T. NOR T.’S TESTIMONY WAS SOLE OR DECISIVE (SEE PARAGRAPHS 104 AND 105 ABOVE). THE COURT WILL THEREFORE CONSIDER THREE ISSUES IN EACH CASE: FIRSTLY, WHETHER IT WAS NECESSARY TO ADMIT THE WITNESS STATEMENTS OF S.T. OR T.; SECONDLY, WHETHER THEIR UNTESTED EVIDENCE WAS THE SOLE OR DECISIVE BASIS FOR EACH APPLICANT’S CONVICTION; AND THIRDLY, WHETHER THERE WERE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS INCLUDING STRONG PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT EACH TRIAL, JUDGED AS A WHOLE, WAS FAIR WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 6 §§ 1 AND 3 (D).
(A)  THE AL-KHAWAJA CASE
153.  THE COURT OBSERVES THAT IT IS NOT IN DISPUTE THAT S.T.’S DEATH MADE IT NECESSARY TO ADMIT HER WITNESS STATEMENT IF HER EVIDENCE WAS TO BE CONSIDERED.
154.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE GOVERNMENT’S SUBMISSION THAT S.T.’S STATEMENT WAS NOT SOLE OR DECISIVE BECAUSE THERE WAS OTHER EVIDENCE SUPPORTING IT, THE COURT NOTES THAT THE JUDGE WHO ADMITTED S.T.’S STATEMENT WAS WELL PLACED TO EVALUATE ITS SIGNIFICANCE. HE WAS QUITE CLEAR WHEN HE OBSERVED “NO STATEMENT, NO COUNT ONE” (SEE PARAGRAPH 13 ABOVE). IT IS NOT FOR THE COURT, SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS, TO GAINSAY SUCH AN EVALUATION. THE COURT IS THEREFORE COMPELLED TO CONCLUDE THAT S.T.’S STATEMENT WAS DECISIVE.
155.  NEVERTHELESS, AS THE COURT HAS INDICATED (SEE PARAGRAPH 147 ABOVE) THE ADMISSION OF THE STATEMENT IN EVIDENCE CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS CONCLUSIVE AS TO THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE TRIAL, BUT AS A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR TO BE PLACED IN THE BALANCE ALONGSIDE THE PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS NOTED ABOVE AND OTHER COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS PRESENT IN THE CASE.
156.  THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE WERE OBVIOUSLY IN FAVOUR OF ADMITTING IN EVIDENCE THE STATEMENT OF S.T., WHICH WAS RECORDED BY THE POLICE IN PROPER FORM. THE RELIABILITY OF THE EVIDENCE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT S.T. HAD MADE HER COMPLAINT TO TWO FRIENDS, B.F. AND S.H., PROMPTLY AFTER THE EVENTS IN QUESTION, AND THAT THERE WERE ONLY MINOR INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN HER STATEMENT AND THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY HER TO THE TWO FRIENDS, WHO BOTH GAVE EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THERE WERE STRONG SIMILARITIES BETWEEN S.T.’S DESCRIPTION OF THE ALLEGED ASSAULT AND THAT OF THE OTHER COMPLAINANT, V.U., WITH WHOM THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY COLLUSION. IN A CASE OF INDECENT ASSAULT BY A DOCTOR ON HIS PATIENT, WHICH TOOK PLACE DURING A PRIVATE CONSULTATION WHERE ONLY HE AND THE VICTIM WERE PRESENT, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE OF STRONGER CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN EACH OF THE OTHER WITNESSES WAS CALLED TO GIVE EVIDENCE AT TRIAL AND THEIR RELIABILITY WAS TESTED BY CROSS-EXAMINATION.
157.  IT IS TRUE THAT THE JUDGE’S DIRECTION TO THE JURY WAS FOUND TO BE DEFICIENT BY THE COURT OF APPEAL. HOWEVER, THE COURT OF APPEAL ALSO HELD THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN CLEAR TO THE JURY FROM THAT DIRECTION THAT, IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE APPLICANT’S INABILITY TO CROSS-EXAMINE S.T. AND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO SEE AND HEAR HER, HER STATEMENT SHOULD CARRY LESS WEIGHT WITH THEM (SEE PARAGRAPH 22 ABOVE). HAVING REGARD TO THIS DIRECTION, AND THE EVIDENCE OFFERED BY THE PROSECUTION IN SUPPORT OF S.T.’S STATEMENT, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THE JURY WAS ABLE TO CONDUCT A FAIR AND PROPER ASSESSMENT OF THE RELIABILITY OF S.T.’S ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE FIRST APPLICANT.
158.  AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, AND VIEWING THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS AS A WHOLE, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFICULTIES CAUSED TO THE DEFENCE BY ADMITTING THE STATEMENT AND THE DANGERS OF DOING SO, THERE WERE SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS TO CONCLUDE THAT THE ADMISSION IN EVIDENCE OF S.T.’S STATEMENT DID NOT RESULT IN A BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D).
(B)  THE TAHERY CASE
159.  THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT APPROPRIATE ENQUIRIES WERE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE WERE OBJECTIVE GROUNDS FOR T.’S FEAR. THE TRIAL JUDGE HEARD EVIDENCE FROM BOTH T. AND A POLICE OFFICER AS TO THAT FEAR. THE TRIAL JUDGE WAS ALSO SATISFIED THAT SPECIAL MEASURES, SUCH AS TESTIFYING BEHIND A SCREEN, WOULD NOT ALLAY T.’S FEARS. EVEN THOUGH T.’S IDENTITY AS THE MAKER OF THE INCRIMINATING STATEMENT WAS PUBLICLY DISCLOSED, THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRIAL JUDGE THAT T. HAD A GENUINE FEAR OF GIVING ORAL EVIDENCE AND WAS NOT PREPARED TO DO SO EVEN IF SPECIAL MEASURES WERE INTRODUCED IN THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS PROVIDES A SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION FOR ADMITTING T.’S STATEMENT.

160.  THE COURT NOTES THAT WHEN THOSE PRESENT AT THE SCENE OF THE STABBING WERE ORIGINALLY INTERVIEWED, NO ONE CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN THE APPLICANT STAB S, AND S HIMSELF HAD NOT SEEN WHO HAD STABBED HIM, ALTHOUGH INITIALLY HE PRESUMED IT WAS THE SECOND APPLICANT. T. HAD MADE HIS STATEMENT IMPLICATING THE APPLICANT TWO DAYS AFTER THE EVENT. HE WAS THE ONLY WITNESS WHO HAD CLAIMED TO SEE THE STABBING. HIS UNCORROBORATED EYEWITNESS STATEMENT WAS, IF NOT THE SOLE, AT LEAST THE DECISIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE APPLICANT FOR THAT REASON. IT WAS OBVIOUSLY EVIDENCE OF GREAT WEIGHT AND WITHOUT IT THE CHANCES OF A CONVICTION WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY RECEDED. EVEN THOUGH THE TESTIMONY MAY HAVE BEEN COHERENT AND CONVINCING ON ITS FACE IT CANNOT BE SAID TO BELONG TO THE CATEGORY OF EVIDENCE THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS “DEMONSTRABLY RELIABLE” SUCH AS A DYING DECLARATION OR OTHER EXAMPLES GIVEN BY THE COURT OF APPEAL AND SUPREME COURT IN THEIR HORNCASTLE AND OTHERS JUDGMENTS (SEE PARAGRAPHS 53 AND 60 ABOVE).
161.  SUCH UNTESTED EVIDENCE WEIGHS HEAVILY IN THE BALANCE AND REQUIRES SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE CONSEQUENTIAL DIFFICULTIES CAUSED TO THE DEFENCE BY ITS ADMISSION. RELIANCE IS PLACED BY THE GOVERNMENT ON TWO MAIN COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS: THE FACT THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE CONCLUDED THAT NO UNFAIRNESS WOULD BE CAUSED BY THE ADMISSION OF T.’S STATEMENT SINCE THE APPLICANT WAS IN A POSITION TO CHALLENGE OR REBUT THE STATEMENT BY GIVING EVIDENCE HIMSELF OR CALLING OTHER WITNESSES WHO WERE PRESENT, ONE OF WHOM WAS HIS UNCLE; AND THE WARNING GIVEN BY THE TRIAL JUDGE TO THE JURY THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO APPROACH THE EVIDENCE GIVEN BY THE ABSENT WITNESS WITH CARE.
162.  HOWEVER, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT NEITHER OF THESE FACTORS, WHETHER TAKEN ALONE OR IN COMBINATION, COULD BE A SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCE TO THE HANDICAP UNDER WHICH THE DEFENCE LABOURED. EVEN IF HE GAVE EVIDENCE DENYING THE CHARGE, THE APPLICANT WAS, OF COURSE, UNABLE TO TEST THE TRUTHFULNESS AND RELIABILITY OF T.’S EVIDENCE BY MEANS OF CROSS-EXAMINATION. THE FACT IS THAT T. WAS THE SOLE WITNESS WHO WAS APPARENTLY WILLING OR ABLE TO SAY WHAT HE HAD SEEN. THE DEFENCE WAS NOT ABLE TO CALL ANY OTHER WITNESS TO CONTRADICT THE TESTIMONY PROVIDED IN THE HEARSAY STATEMENT.
163.  THE OTHER EVIDENCE WAS THAT GIVEN BY THE VICTIM S WHO DID NOT KNOW WHO HAD STABBED HIM, ALTHOUGH INITIALLY HE PRESUMED IT WAS THE APPLICANT. HIS EVIDENCE WAS CIRCUMSTANTIAL IN NATURE AND LARGELY UNCONTESTED BY THE APPLICANT. HE GAVE EVIDENCE OF THE FIGHT AND THE APPLICANT’S ACTIONS AFTER THE STABBING (SEE PARAGRAPH 32 ABOVE). WHILE THIS EVIDENCE CORROBORATED SOME OF THE DETAILS OF T.’S TESTIMONY, IT COULD ONLY PROVIDE AT BEST INDIRECT SUPPORT FOR THE CLAIM BY T. THAT IT WAS THE APPLICANT WHO HAD STABBED S.
164.  IT IS TRUE THAT THE DIRECTION IN THE JUDGE’S SUMMING UP TO THE JURY WAS BOTH FULL AND CAREFULLY PHRASED, DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE DANGERS OF RELYING ON UNTESTED EVIDENCE. HOWEVER, THE COURT DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT SUCH A WARNING, HOWEVER CLEARLY OR FORCIBLY EXPRESSED, COULD BE A SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCE WHERE AN UNTESTED STATEMENT OF THE ONLY PROSECUTION EYEWITNESS WAS THE ONLY DIRECT EVIDENCE AGAINST THE APPLICANT.
165.  THE COURT THEREFORE CONSIDERS THAT THE DECISIVE NATURE OF T.’S STATEMENT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY STRONG CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE MEANT THE JURY IN THIS CASE WAS UNABLE TO CONDUCT A FAIR AND PROPER ASSESSMENT OF THE RELIABILITY OF T.’S EVIDENCE. EXAMINING THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS AS A WHOLE, THE COURT CONCLUDES THAT THERE WERE NOT SUFFICIENT COUNTERBALANCING FACTORS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DIFFICULTIES TO THE DEFENCE WHICH RESULTED FROM THE ADMISSION OF T.’S STATEMENT. IT THEREFORE FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D) IN RESPECT OF MR TAHERY.
II.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION
166.  ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION PROVIDES:
“IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION OR THE PROTOCOLS THERETO, AND IF THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTY CONCERNED ALLOWS ONLY PARTIAL REPARATION TO BE MADE, THE COURT SHALL, IF NECESSARY, AFFORD JUST SATISFACTION TO THE INJURED PARTY.”
167.  AS NO VIOLATION HAS BEEN FOUND IN RESPECT OF THE FIRST APPLICANT, JUST SATISFACTION NEED ONLY BE CONSIDERED IN RESPECT OF THE SECOND APPLICANT.
168.  THE SECOND APPLICANT MAINTAINED HIS SUBMISSION THAT, UNLIKE THE MAJORITY OF ARTICLE 6 CASES, IT COULD PROPERLY BE SAID THAT HIS CONVICTION FOR THE OFFENCE IN QUESTION AND HIS SUBSEQUENT SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE VIOLATION. BASED ON THE ADDITIONAL TIME HE SERVED IN PRISON AND WITH REFERENCE TO COMPARABLE DOMESTIC AWARDS FOR UNLAWFUL DETENTION, THE SECOND APPLICANT CLAIMED 65,000 POUNDS STERLING (GBP) (APPROXIMATELY 83,830 EUROS (EUR)). THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THEIR SUBMISSIONS THAT THERE WAS NO CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ALLEGED VIOLATION AND THE CONVICTION OF THE APPLICANT, THAT DOMESTIC CASE-LAW WAS OF LIMITED RELEVANCE AND THAT ANY FINDING OF A VIOLATION AMOUNTED TO SUFFICIENT JUST SATISFACTION. ALTERNATIVELY, A MUCH LOWER SUM, SUCH AS THE EUR 6,000 AWARDED IN VISSER V. THE NETHERLANDS (NO. 26668/95, § 56, 14 FEBRUARY 2002), WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
169.  IN ITS JUDGMENT, THE CHAMBER ACCEPTED THAT DOMESTIC CASE-LAW WAS OF LIMITED RELEVANCE TO THE QUESTION OF NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE IN PROCEEDINGS BEFORE IT. IT FOUND, HOWEVER, THAT THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE SECOND APPLICANT, AT LEAST IN RESPECT OF THE CHARGE WHICH WAS BASED ON T.’S STATEMENT, WAS NOT CONDUCTED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CONVENTION AND THAT THE APPLICANT HAD INEVITABLY SUFFERED A DEGREE OF DISTRESS AND ANXIETY AS A RESULT. IT AWARDED THE SUM OF EUR 6,000 BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGE.
170.  THE GRAND CHAMBER SEES NO REASON TO DEPART FROM THE CHAMBER’S ASSESSMENT AND ACCORDINGLY MAKES THE SAME AWARD OF EUR 6,000.
171.  BEFORE THE CHAMBER, THE SECOND APPLICANT CLAIMED A TOTAL OF GBP 7,995 FOR COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY EUR 9,079. THIS COMPRISED GBP 5,571.47 (INCLUSIVE OF VALUE-ADDED TAX (VAT)) FOR APPROXIMATELY 45 HOURS’ WORK BY MS TROWLER, WHICH INCLUDED ATTENDANCE AT THE CHAMBER HEARING AND TRAVELLING TIME TO STRASBOURG. SOLICITOR’S COSTS AND EXPENSES WERE GBP 2,423.56 (INCLUSIVE OF VAT) WHICH COVERED COSTS OF GBP 1,734.16 FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 HOURS’ WORK AND GBP 689.40 IN EXPENSES.
172.  BEFORE THE GRAND CHAMBER, THE SECOND APPLICANT CLAIMED A TOTAL OF GBP 3,614.82 IN RESPECT OF SOLICITOR’S COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH COVERED THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE CHAMBER AND THE GRAND CHAMBER. HE ALSO CLAIMED AN ADDITIONAL GBP 3,643 (INCLUSIVE OF VAT) FOR A FURTHER 37 HOURS’ WORK BY MS TROWLER. THIS INCLUDED 17 HOURS’ WORK TO COVER HER ANTICIPATED ATTENDANCE AT THE GRAND CHAMBER HEARING AND TRAVELLING TIME TO STRASBOURG. SHE WAS, IN THE EVENT, UNABLE TO ATTEND THE HEARING.
173.  THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED THE HOURLY RATES WHICH HAD BEEN CHARGED TO BE EXCESSIVE.
174.  THE COURT FINDS THAT THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED ARE NOT EXCESSIVE IN THE LIGHT OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CASE. THUS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 17 HOURS’ ATTENDANCE AND TRAVELLING TIME TO THE GRAND CHAMBER HEARING (WHICH WERE NOT ACTUALLY INCURRED), THE REMAINDER OF THE SECOND APPLICANT’S COSTS AND EXPENSES SHOULD BE MET IN FULL. IT THEREFORE AWARDS EUR 13,150, INCLUSIVE OF VAT, LESS EUR 1,150 ALREADY RECEIVED IN LEGAL AID FROM THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, TO BE CONVERTED INTO POUNDS STERLING ON THE DATE OF SETTLEMENT.
175.  THE COURT CONSIDERS IT APPROPRIATE THAT THE DEFAULT INTEREST RATE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE MARGINAL LENDING RATE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, TO WHICH SHOULD BE ADDED THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS.
FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT
1.  HOLDS, BY FIFTEEN VOTES TO TWO, THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D) IN RESPECT OF MR AL-KHAWAJA;
2.  HOLDS, UNANIMOUSLY, THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 6 § 3 (D) IN RESPECT OF MR TAHERY;
3.  HOLDS, UNANIMOUSLY,
(A)  THAT THE RESPONDENT STATE IS TO PAY THE SECOND APPLICANT, MR TAHERY, WITHIN THREE MONTHS, THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS, TO BE CONVERTED INTO POUNDS STERLING AT THE RATE APPLICABLE AT THE DATE OF SETTLEMENT:
(B)  THAT FROM THE EXPIRY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED THREE MONTHS UNTIL SETTLEMENT SIMPLE INTEREST SHALL BE PAYABLE ON THE ABOVE AMOUNTS AT A RATE EQUAL TO THE MARGINAL LENDING RATE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK DURING THE DEFAULT PERIOD PLUS THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS;
4.  DISMISSES, UNANIMOUSLY, THE REMAINDER OF THE APPLICANTS’ CLAIM FOR JUST SATISFACTION.
"
149,001-58257,Grand Chamber,"10.The applicants are British citizens resident in London. The first applicant, MrsMulkiye Osman, was born in Cyprus in 1948. She is the widow of Mr Ali Osman who was shot dead by Mr Paul Paget-Lewis on 7March 1988. The second applicant, Ahmet Osman, is her son, born in England in 1972. He was a former pupil of Paul Paget-Lewis at Homerton House School. Ahmet Osman was wounded in the shooting incident which led to the death of his father. The applicants complaints are directed at the failure of the authorities to appreciate and act on what they claim was a series of clear warning signs that Paul Paget-Lewis represented a serious threat to the physical safety of Ahmet Osman and his family. There is disagreement between the applicants and the respondent State on essential aspects of the circumstances leading to the tragedy. The applicants have disputed in this respect the completeness of the facts as found by the Commission. 11.In 1986 the headmaster of Homerton House School, MrJohn Prince, noticed that one of his teaching staff, Paul Paget-Lewis, had developed an attachment to Ahmet Osman, a pupil at the school. According to a statement which he made to the police on 10March 1988, MrPrince indicated that he “made a point of personally keeping an eye on the situation”. As a result of this attachment, Paget-Lewis informed MrPrince that he intended to leave the school and become a supply teacher. MrKenneth Perkins, a deputy head teacher, spoke with Paget-Lewis and managed to persuade him to remain at the school. 12.In January 1987 MrsGreen, the mother of Leslie Green, another pupil at the school and the applicants’ neighbour, telephoned MrFleming – another deputy head teacher – to complain that Paget-Lewis had been following her son home after school and harassing him. She alleged that Paget-Lewis had been spreading rumours that her son had engaged in deviant sexual practices and that he objected to her son’s friendship with Ahmet Osman. MrsGreen made a formal complaint to this effect to MrPrince on 2March 1987. 13.On 3March 1987 Mr Perkins interviewed Leslie Green, who confirmed that Paget-Lewis had been following him and had been spreading rumours of a sexual nature about him because of his friendship with AhmetOsman. 14.Also on 3March 1987 MrFleming interviewed Ahmet Osman. In the typed record of this interview dated 6March 1987, Ahmet confirmed that Paget-Lewis had warned him about Leslie Green, accusing Leslie of sexual misconduct with another boy at the school. Ahmet also reported to MrFleming during the interview that on one occasion Paget-Lewis had followed Leslie and himself home in his car. He also stated that Paget-Lewis had asked him to come and see him in his classroom at lunch times, apparently to learn Turkish, and that Paget-Lewis had taken photographs of him and given him money, a pen and a Turkish dictionary. However, he later took the pen and deliberately snapped it in half during a lesson. 15.On 6March 1987 MrPerkins interviewed Paget-Lewis. In the course of the interview Paget-Lewis stated that he had a special relationship with Ahmet Osman which had developed over a period of a year and which Leslie Green was trying to disrupt and that he was so upset on one occasion that he confronted Leslie and accused the boy of being a sexual deviant. He admitted that he had followed Leslie home on one occasion and had waited outside his parents’ house for 45minutes. Paget-Lewis mentioned to MrPerkins that he had told Leslie Green that he would become “very angry” if anything happened to his relationship with Ahmet, although he indicated to MrPerkins that this was not to be seen as a threat. He also acknowledged that he had given Ahmet money and presents, and had taken photographs of him for “sentimental reasons”. In a later memorandum dated 5May 1988, MrPerkins described Paget-Lewis as having been in a highly irrational state during this interview and unwilling to admit that his behaviour displayed a serious lack of wisdom and professionalism. 16.On 9March 1987 Paget-Lewis submitted a written statement to MrPerkins regarding the complaint made by MrsGreen. In his memorandum of 5May 1988 (see paragraph 15 above) MrPerkins stated that he found the statement “disturbing” since it showed clearly that Paget-Lewis was “overpoweringly jealous” of the friendship between AhmetOsman and Leslie Green and provided clear evidence that he “was not in control of his emotions”. Leslie was presented as devious, malicious and an evil influence. MrPerkins again interviewed Paget-Lewis on his written statement during which he pointed out his concerns about the content of the statement and suggested to Paget-Lewis that he seek psychiatric help. MrPerkins informed MrPrince of everything which had happened up until that date. 17.Prior to 13March 1987 MrPrince had an informal discussion with Paget-Lewis in which he admitted telling pupils at the school that LeslieGreen had engaged in acts of oral sex with Ahmet Osman in revenge for rumours spread by Leslie concerning his relationship with Ahmet. On 13March 1987 Mr Prince formally interviewed Paget-Lewis on the basis of the notes of the interview between Paget-Lewis and MrPerkins. The contemporaneous notes taken of the meeting reveal that Paget-Lewis admitted that he had become attached to Ahmet Osman; that he had accused Leslie Green of trying to turn Ahmet against him; and that he had parked outside Leslie’s house to show that he was not to be scared away. Paget-Lewis denied that he had accused Leslie of deviant sexual practices. The notes of the meeting conclude with the sentence “the situation has now escalated and Mr Prince has no confidence in his own ability to contain it”. 18.MrPrince was informed on 16March 1987 in an interview with Leslie Green and his mother that Paget-Lewis had been spying on AhmetOsman and that Paget-Lewis had told Ahmet that “he knew where his mother worked and how much money she earned and that if Ahmet left school, he would find him”. 19.During this period another deputy head teacher, Mr Youssouf, also interviewed Ahmet Osman on a number of occasions. These interviews revealed that Paget-Lewis had told Ahmet that he would be able to find him if he left the school. Paget-Lewis claimed to have discovered Ahmet’s previous address and the name of his previous school and said he had visited the area and had spoken to his former neighbours. 20.On 17March 1987 MrPrince met with the Osman family to explain his concerns about the interest Paget-Lewis had taken in Ahmet. He explained that the school was quite satisfied that nothing improper had taken place between Paget-Lewis and Ahmet. He told them that the school would monitor the situation closely to ensure that Ahmet would be safe. Ahmet was told never to be alone with Paget-Lewis. During this meeting Ahmet’s mother expressed her wish that her son should be transferred to another school. 21.According to the diary of MrPrince between 3March 1987 and 17March 1987 he met with PC Williams on four occasions. The applicants state that during these meetings information concerning Paget-Lewis’ conduct towards Ahmet Osman was passed on to the police. The Government state that PC Williams had no recollection of being told about the presents which Paget-Lewis had given to Ahmet or that Paget-Lewis had followed Ahmet home. PC Williams did not keep any record of the meetings, nor did he make any report concerning the nature and extent of the information that was communicated to him, or if he did no such record now exists. The Government stress that all concerned were satisfied that there was no sexual element to Paget-Lewis’ attachment to Ahmet and the matter could be dealt with internally by the school. 22.By 17 March 1987 graffiti had appeared at six locations around the school which read “Leslie, do not forget to wear a condom when you screw Ahmet or he will get Aids.” The words had been written with spray paint and a stencil. 23.Following the discovery of the graffiti, MrPerkins interviewed Paget-Lewis and asked him if he was responsible. He denied this. However, MrPerkins noted in his report that Paget-Lewis knew the precise wording and the exact locations of all the graffiti. 24.On 19March 1987 a further discussion took place between MrPrince and the Osman family regarding Ahmet’s transfer to another school. For his safety Mr Prince told Ahmet not to give his new school address to anyone from Homerton House. While attempting to arrange his transfer, Mr Youssouf discovered that the files relating to Ahmet and LeslieGreen had been stolen from the school office. The file relating to staff disciplinary matters was also found to be missing. MrPerkins considered that the stolen files were the likely source of the information that Paget-Lewis had acquired about Ahmet Osman’s previous address and school (see paragraph 19 above). He subsequently questioned Paget-Lewis, who denied any involvement in the theft and denied having made any comments about Ahmet’s previous address and school or visiting the area in which Ahmet used to live. 25.On 23March 1987 Ahmet Osman was transferred to a different school, but owing to curriculum difficulties he had to return to Homerton House fourteen days later. 26.On 14April 1987, Paget-Lewis changed his name by deed poll to Paul Ahmet Yildirim Osman. On 1May 1987, MrPrince wrote to the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) informing them that Paget-Lewis had changed his name and that he was worried that some psychological imbalance might pose a threat to the safety of Ahmet Osman. He also stated that he was of the opinion that Paget-Lewis should be removed from the school as soon as possible. 27.On 4May 1987 MrPrince spoke with two police officers, Detective Chief Inspector Newman and Detective Inspector Clarke. According to the applicants during this meeting the headmaster informed them of the missing files and the graffiti incident and discussed the fact that Paget-Lewis’ real name was Ronald Stephen Potter. He had previously changed his name by deed poll to name himself after a pupil called Paget-Lewis whom he had taught at Highbury Grove School. The Government state that the two police officers have no recollection of having been informed of these matters. 28.Following his letter of 1May 1987 (see paragraph 26 above), MrPrince wrote to the Head of Discipline at ILEA in a letter dated 8May 1987 stating that while he believed Paget-Lewis needed medical help, his continued presence in the school jeopardised the welfare, safety and education of the pupils. An internal memorandum from the Head of Discipline at ILEA dated the same day makes reference to “a fear that [Paget-Lewis] might seek to take the boy out of the country” and that the police are investigating the complaint that “he has removed certain files about the matter from the school”. Undated notes written by the same official between 14April and 8May 1987 indicate that it was feared that Ahmet Osman may be harmed and that by changing his name Paget-Lewis may abscond with the boy. The notes refer to the fact that the police had stated that Mr Prince should contact them if Ahmet goes missing for more than an hour. In addition, the police would investigate the disappearance of the missing files, search Paget-Lewis’ home and check up on his background. The Government deny that the police said that they should be contacted if Ahmet went missing or that they intended to search Paget-Lewis’ house. 29.On 19 May 1987 Paget-Lewis was seen by Dr Ferguson, the ILEA psychiatrist. Dr Ferguson was provided with, inter alia, the documents showing Paget-Lewis’ change of name; the records of the interviews conducted in March 1987; and the memorandum prepared by Mr Perkins on 5May 1987 (see paragraph 15 above). Dr Ferguson reported: “This teacher must indeed give cause for concern. He does not present ill in formal terms, nor does he seem sexually deviant. He does have personality problems, and his judgment regarding his friendship with a pupil is reprehensibly suspect.” DrFerguson recommended that Paget-Lewis remain teaching at the school but that he should receive some form of counselling and psychotherapy. 30.On or about 21May 1987, a brick was thrown through a window of the applicants’ house. The police were informed and a police officer was sent to the house and completed a crime report. On two occasions in June1987 the tyres of Ali Osman’s car were deliberately burst. Both incidents were reported to the police, but no police records relating to the offences can be found. 31.On 1June 1987 Mr Prince requested Paget-Lewis to take sick-leave. On 2June 1987 Paget-Lewis was examined again by DrFerguson. He described a continuing strong urge to speak with Ahmet Osman and said that he felt angry that Ahmet seemed content with the situation of non-contact. Dr Ferguson concluded that under the circumstances, Paget-Lewis should remain away from Homerton House and was designated temporarily unfit to work. Paget-Lewis subsequently informed Mr Perkins that he would be taking medical leave for the remainder of the school term. He then left Homerton House and did not return again. 32.On 16June 1987, following a further interview with Paget-Lewis, DrFerguson recommended that he should no longer teach at Homerton House and that transfer on medical grounds was strongly and urgently recommended. 33.On 4June 1987 Mrs Green telephoned MrPerkins making further complaints about Paget-Lewis following her son. She also informed him that she had sent her son to stay with her sister. 34.On 18June 1987, Paget-Lewis was suspended pending an ILEA investigation for “unprofessional behaviour” towards Ahmet Osman. He submitted a statement dated 6July 1987 in which, inter alia, he admitted taking photographs of Ahmet and giving him money but denied stealing files or painting graffiti. He accused MrPerkins of lying about him and said that MrPerkins has stated his intention of breaking him. 35.On 7August 1987, ILEA sent a letter to Paget-Lewis officially reprimanding and severely warning him but lifting the suspension. The letter also stated that he was not to return to Homerton House. Shortly afterwards he began working as a supply teacher at two other local schools, Haggerston School and Skinners School. 36.In August or September 1987, a mixture of engine oil and paraffin was poured on the area outside the Osman family home. On 18October1987, the windscreen of Ali Osman’s car was smashed. During November 1987, in a series of incidents, the applicants’ front door lock was jammed with superglue, dog excrement was smeared on their doorstep and on their car, and on more than one occasion the light bulb was stolen from the light in the outside porch. Around this time all the windows of their car were also broken. All these incidents were reported to the police and on two occasions Ali Osman visited Hackney police station to discuss the vandalism and criminal damage to his property. 37.At some point during November 1987, PC Adams visited the Osmans’ home and then spoke to Paget-Lewis about the acts of vandalism. In a later statement to the police, Paget-Lewis alleged that he told PCAdams that the loss of his job was so distressing that he felt that he was in danger of doing something criminally insane. The Government deny that this was said, and refer to the fact that during the interview with PC Adams Paget-Lewis denied any involvement in the acts of vandalism and criminal damage. No detailed records were made by PC Adams of his contacts with Paget-Lewis or the Osman family. Any entries in notebooks or duty registers (crime reports or parade books) could not later be traced by the Metropolitan Police Solicitor’s Department. 38.On 7December 1987 a car driven by Paget-Lewis collided with a van in which Leslie Green was a passenger. According to the driver of the van, Paget-Lewis claimed that his accelerator had jammed and that he could not help what happened. After the police arrived at the scene of the accident they cautioned Paget-Lewis, and provided him with a form requesting him to produce his driving documents. 39.On 10December 1987 Paget-Lewis attended Hackney police station and produced his driving documents for inspection. Since he failed to produce a road worthiness (MOT) certificate for his car he was cautioned by the police. 40.In a statement taken by the police on 22December 1987 from the driver of the van that had been allegedly rammed by Paget-Lewis, the driver recalled that after the accident Paget-Lewis had said: “I’m not worried because in a few months I’ll be doing life.” 41.On 8December 1987, following the collision incident, DetectiveSergeant Boardman contacted ILEA stating that he wished to interview Paget-Lewis and the headmaster. The applicants state that DetectiveSergeant Boardman assured ILEA that the Osman family would be protected. The Government deny that such an assurance was given. An ILEA memorandum dated 8December 1987 referred to the harassment of the Osman family and Paget-Lewis’ alleged admission of responsibility for the van collision saying that Leslie Green had lured Ahmet Osman away from his affections. It noted that the police were pursuing enquiries but that if nothing was heard the matter should be “chased”. It concluded with the note “Families getting police protection”. 42.On 9December 1987 Detective Sergeant Boardman took a detailed statement from Leslie Green and his mother concerning, inter alia, the fact that Paget-Lewis had followed Leslie home, the acts of harassment and the graffiti which had appeared at the school. In his statement Leslie claimed that Paget-Lewis had threatened to “get him” whether it took “thirty days or thirty years”. He also said that he had not been to school for two weeks as he was afraid to travel there and that he had moved in with his aunt, so as to be safe from Paget-Lewis. 43.On 14December 1987 Detective Sergeant Boardman visited Homerton House and inspected the graffiti. A police photographer took photographs of the graffiti. 44.On or about 15December 1987 Detective Sergeant Boardman visited the Osman family and discussed the criminal damage and Paget-Lewis’ relationship with Ahmet. The applicants allege that DetectiveSergeant Boardman told the family that he knew Paget-Lewis was responsible for the acts of vandalism, and gave them assurances that he would cause the incidents to stop. The Government deny that DetectiveSergeant Boardman said that he knew Paget-Lewis was responsible, and that he gave assurances as to the family’s safety. 45.In his report on the case which was completed on or about 15December 1987, Detective Sergeant Boardman observed: “It should be pointed out at this stage that there is no evidence to implicate Paget-Lewis in either of these offences [the graffiti at the school] or the acts of vandalism against Osmans’ address, although there is no doubt in everybody’s mind that he was in fact responsible and this was just another example of his spite.” 46.On 15December 1987 Paget-Lewis was interviewed by officers of ILEA at his own request. An ILEA memorandum dated the same day recorded that Paget-Lewis felt in a totally self-destructive mood, stating that it was all a symphony and the last chord had to be played. He admitted being deeply in debt and as a result was selling all his possessions. He blamed Mr Perkins for all his troubles but would not do a “Hungerford” in a school but would see him at his home. The memorandum stated that the concerns of ILEA should be passed on to the police and noted that a call was made to Detective Sergeant Boardman, who was unavailable. Nevertheless, a detailed message was left with the receptionist. One of the officers of ILEA recalled later in a statement dated 9March 1988 that Paget-Lewis spoke in a manner which was very disturbing, said that he blamed Mr Perkins for the loss of his job, that he knew where he lived and that he was going to do something though not at the school. The other officer recalled in her statement of 9March 1988 that Paget-Lewis had stated that he was going to do something that would be “a sort of Hungerford”. She recalled that as a result of this conversation she informed the police and the school that she considered that the head and deputy head were at risk of violence. Although the applicants state that the content of the interview was passed on to the police, the Government deny that mention was made of the “Hungerford” reference or that there was any suggestion that the Osmans might be in danger. 47.On 15December 1987 after receiving the message of the officer of ILEA (see paragraph 46 above), Detective Sergeant Boardman sent a telex to the local police station near MrPerkins’ home referring to the fact that vague threats had been made and that the school authorities were very concerned. He asked them to pay casual attention to the address, giving a brief description of Paget-Lewis and the registration number of his car. 48.On 16December 1987 Detective Sergeant Boardman contacted ILEA with a view to tracing Paget-Lewis and was provided with his address. He requested the official at ILEA to ask Paget-Lewis to contact the police. On the same day, Detective Sergeant Boardman met with MrPrince and MrPerkins. The applicants state that he assured MrPrince that the police would undertake the necessary measures to protect both MrPerkins and the applicants. A diary entry of MrPrince dated 16December 1987 refers to Detective Sergeant Boardman and contains a heading “OSMAN/PERKINS/POLICE PRESENCE ARRANGED” and a note that ILEA had called “to finalise arrangements re protection for Perkins/Osman families”. According to the Government no assurance of protection was given. Detective Sergeant Boardman received the impression from his meetings with MrPrince and MrPerkins that Paget-Lewis was angry at being removed from the school but that the anger was directed against the deputy head, who in any case did not feel in danger. 49.On 17December 1987 Detective Sergeant Boardman and other police officers arrived at Paget-Lewis’ house with the intention of arresting him on suspicion of criminal damage. Paget-Lewis was absent. The police were unaware that he was teaching at Haggerston School that day. 50.On 18December 1987 pursuant to the request of the police, ILEA sent a letter to Paget-Lewis requesting him to contact Detective Sergeant Boardman. The same day ILEA informed the police that Paget-Lewis had not attended Haggerston School. He did not return to the school again. 51.In early January 1988 the police commenced the procedure of laying an information before the Magistrates’ Court with a view to prosecuting Paget-Lewis for driving without due care and attention. In addition, Paget-Lewis’ name was put on the Police National Computer as being wanted in relation to the collision incident and on suspicion of having committed offences of criminal damage. 52.On 8January an officer of ILEA rang Detective Sergeant Boardman for an update on the case but he was unavailable. Three days later he returned her call saying there had been no progress. 53.Between January and March 1988 Paget-Lewis travelled around England hiring cars in his adopted name of Osman and was involved in a number of accidents. He spent time at his home address during this period and continued to receive mail there. 54.On 17January 1988 Paget-Lewis broke into a car parked near a clay-pigeon shoot near Leeds in Yorkshire and stole a shotgun. He sawed off both barrels. While the theft was reported to the local police, because there was nothing to connect the incident to Paget-Lewis the theft did not come to the attention of the Metropolitan police dealing with the case. 55.On 1, 4 and 5March 1988 Leslie Green saw Paget-Lewis wearing a black crash helmet near the applicants’ home. According to the applicants, MrsGreen informed the police on each occasion, but her calls were not returned. The Government accept that, on 5March 1988, DetectiveSergeantBoardman received a message which stated “phone MrsGreen” but since there was no phone number on the note he did not connect the message with the mother of Leslie Green. 56.On 7March 1988 Paget-Lewis was seen near the applicants’ home by a number of people. At about 11 p.m. Paget-Lewis shot and killed AliOsman and seriously wounded Ahmet. He then drove to the home of MrPerkins where he shot and wounded him and killed his son. 57.Early the next morning Paget-Lewis was arrested. On being arrested he stated “why didn’t you stop me before I did it, I gave you all the warning signs?” 58.Later that day Paget-Lewis was interviewed by the police. According to the record of the interview, Paget-Lewis said that he had been planning the attacks ever since he lost his job, and for the previous two weeks he had been watching the Osmans’ house. Although he considered MrPerkins as his main target, he also regarded Ali and Ahmet Osman as being responsible for his losing his position at Homerton House. Paget-Lewis stated that he had been hoping in the back of his mind that the police would stop him. He admitted holding the family at gunpoint as they returned to the house, making Ali and Ahmet Osman kneel down in the kitchen, turning out the light and shooting at them. He denied that on earlier occasions he had damaged the windows of the Osmans’ house but admitted that he had let down the tyres of their car as a prank. He also denied responsibility for the graffiti and taking the files from the school office. 59.On 28October 1988 Paget-Lewis was convicted of two charges of manslaughter having pleaded guilty on grounds of diminished responsibility (see paragraph 73 below). He was sentenced to be detained in a secure mental hospital without limit of time pursuant to section 41 of the Mental Health Act 1983. 60.An inquest was held into the death of Ali Osman after the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. Since a person had been convicted in connection with the death, the Coroner did not hold a full inquest (section16 of the Coroner’s Act 1988). 61.On 28September 1989 the applicants commenced proceedings against, inter alios, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis alleging negligence in that although the police were aware of Paget-Lewis’ activities since May 1987 they failed to apprehend or interview him, search his home or charge him with an offence before March 1988. Orders for discovery of documents were made on 24April 1990. 62.On 19August 1991 the Metropolitan Police Commissioner issued an application to strike out the statement of claim on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The High Court judge dismissed the application. 63.On 7October 1992 the Court of Appeal upheld the appeal by the Commissioner (Osman and another v. Ferguson and another [1993] 4 All England Law Reports at p. 344). In its judgment, the court held that in light of previous authorities no action could lie against the police in negligence in the investigation and suppression of crime on the grounds that public policy required an immunity from suit. 64.Lord Justice McCowan found, inter alia: “In my judgment the plaintiffs [the applicants] have therefore an arguable cause that as between [the second applicant] and his family, on the one hand and the investigating officers, on the other, there existed a very close degree of proximity amounting to a special relationship.” 65.However, having regard to the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of Hill v. Chief Constable of West Yorkshire (see paragraphs90–92 below), from which he found no relevant distinction, he considered that the matters in issue were failures in investigation of crime and thus public policy doomed the action to failure. He rejected the argument that where the class of victim was sufficiently proximate and sufficiently small the public policy argument might not apply. He found that Lord Keith in the Hill case had treated public policy as a separate point that is not reached unless there is a duty of care. The second judge in the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Beldam, also held that on grounds of public policy the claims were not maintainable but refrained from expressing an opinion as to whether the facts, if proved, were sufficient to establish a relationship sufficiently proximate to found a duty of care. Lord Justice Simon Brown agreed with the judgment of LordJustice McCowan. The applicants’ claim was accordingly struck out. 66.The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords and the application to the House of Lords for leave to appeal was refused on 10May 1993. 67.The domestic courts had not established the full facts of the case since Paget-Lewis pleaded guilty to the charges against him and a full inquest was not conducted into the death of Ali Osman (see paragraph 60 above). Furthermore, the applicants’ civil action against the police was struck out as showing no reasonable cause of action (see paragraph 65 above). Having examined the submissions and materials of the parties especially as regards the facts in dispute the Commission proceeded to the establishment of the facts of the case. Its findings may be summarised as follows. 68.As to the four meetings which took place between the police and the school between 3March and 17March 1987 (see paragraph 21 above), the Commission was satisfied that the police were made aware of the substance of the events and of the school’s concerns about the disturbing attachment which Paget-Lewis was showing towards Ahmet Osman as well as Paget-Lewis’ worrying reaction towards Leslie Green. Furthermore, MrPrince had in all probability informed Detective Inspectors Newman and Clarke on 4May 1987 (see paragraph 27 above) about the graffiti incident, the theft of the school files and Paget-Lewis’ change of name, even if both officers had no recollection of having been told about the first two matters. Like the meetings between PC Williams and Mr Prince, no police notes appear to have been taken. However, the Commission did not find it established that at this stage the police had made any commitment to searching Paget-Lewis’ home or were seriously concerned about the possibility of Paget-Lewis kidnapping Ahmet. These hypotheses emerge from the memoranda drawn up by ILEA officers around this time (see paragraph 28 above) and were probably based on the contacts which the officers had with MrPrince and not on any direct contact between the officers and the police. 69.While all the vandalism on the Osmans’ home and property between May and November 1987 had been reported to the police and the family had informed the police of its concern that Paget-Lewis was behind the attacks, the only step taken during that period was to invite Paget-Lewis to the police station for an interview (see paragraph 37 above). In the Commission’s opinion, little reliance could be placed on Paget-Lewis’ later assertions that he told PC Adams during the interview that he was in danger of doing something criminally insane. No police notes or records of this meeting which took place on an unspecified date could be traced. 70.Following the alleged ramming incident (see paragraph 38 above), the police immediately interviewed the Greens and the Osmans and photographed the graffiti at the school (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above). Although Detective Sergeant Boardman in his undated report (see paragraph45 above) had stated that there was no evidence that Paget-Lewis was responsible for the graffiti and the attacks on the Osmans’ home the police had nevertheless taken the view that he was presenting a sufficient threat that formal steps should be taken against him. Thus the decision was taken on 16December 1987 to arrest Paget-Lewis on suspicion of criminal damage. The Commission was also satisfied that there was no evidence that Paget-Lewis had made any direct or indirect threats against the Osmans during his meeting with ILEA officers on 15December 1987 (see paragraph46 above). It placed greater weight on the contemporaneous notes of the meeting rather than on the statement of one of the officers taken several months later that Paget-Lewis threatened at the meeting to commit a “Hungerford massacre”. According to the notes of the meeting, Paget-Lewis is reported as having stated that he would not do a “Hungerford” at the school but would see the deputy at home. In the Commission’s view, this would explain why the police requested that a casual watch should be kept on MrPerkins’ address. Furthermore, despite the wording of the ILEA memorandum of 8December and of MrPrince’s rather cryptic diary entry on 16December 1987 (see paragraphs 41 and 48 above) it seemed unlikely that the police had referred to or promised police protection to the Osman family especially since none was in fact envisaged or provided. The school authorities had probably received this impression from the assurances given by the police that the necessary measures were being taken to deal with the situation including the vague threats made against MrPerkins. 71.The Commission did not find it established that the letter sent by the ILEA to Paget-Lewis at the request of the police following the failed arrest attempt on 17December 1987 caused Paget-Lewis to disappear (see paragraph 50 above). It was also satisfied that the police took no further active steps to trace the whereabouts of Paget-Lewis from 18 December 1987 to March 1988 apart from placing his name on the Police National Computer in January 1988. In addition, there were no contemporaneous records to support the assertion that MrsGreen had informed the police about Paget-Lewis being seen by her son around the Osman home in early March 1988 (see paragraph 55 above). It may have been the case that MrsGreen merely left a message with the police station that Detective Sergeant Boardman should ring her back. In that event, it was not surprising that Detective Sergeant Boardman had not been able to make a connection between a Mrs Green and the Paget-Lewis file since the case had been dormant for three months. 72.The offence of murder is committed if a person of sound mind unlawfully kills any human being with malice aforethought. The mental element of murder, “malice aforethought”, is established if it is proved that there was, on the part of the accused, an intention to kill, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm or an intention to do an act knowing it to be highly probable that the act will cause death or grievous bodily harm. The sentence for murder is life imprisonment. 73.The offence of manslaughter is committed if the victim is unlawfully killed by a person who, by reason of abnormality of mind, suffered from diminished responsibility – i.e. who suffered from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts. The sentence of manslaughter is imprisonment for life or for any shorter term. 74.The power to obtain a warrant to search for items that have been used, or are intended for use, in committing criminal damage is governed by section6(1) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 which provides: “If it is made to appear by information on oath before a justice of the peace that there is reasonable cause to believe that any person has in his custody or under his control or on his premises anything which there is reasonable cause to believe has been used or is intended for use without lawful excuse – (a)to destroy or damage property belonging to another; or (b)to destroy or damage any property in a way likely to endanger the life of another, the Justice of the Peace may grant a warrant authorising any constable to search for and seize that thing.” 75.In order for an arrest to be lawful it must first satisfy either section24 or 25 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (“the 1984 Act”). 76.Under section24 a police officer may arrest any person whom he has reasonable grounds to believe is guilty of an arrestable offence. All offences which carry a maximum sentence of five years’ imprisonment or more are considered arrestable offences (section 24(1)). 77.Under section 25 a police officer may arrest without warrant any person whom he has reasonable grounds to suspect is guilty of a non-arrestable offence provided that one of the general interest conditions apply. These include: (a) that the constable has reasonable grounds for doubting whether a name furnished by the relevant person as a name is in fact his real name (section25(3)(a)); (b) that the constable has reasonable grounds to believe that an arrest is necessary to prevent the relevant person causing physical injury to any person or causing loss or damage to property (section 25(3)(d)(i) and (ii)); (c) that the constable has reasonable grounds to believe that an arrest is necessary to protect a child or other vulnerable person from the relevant person (section25(3)(e)). 78.In determining whether the available information is sufficient to give rise to a reasonable suspicion, the test to be applied is that laid down by the House of Lords in Hussein v. Chang Fook Kam [1970] Appeal Cases at p.942: “Suspicion in its ordinary meaning is a state of conjuncture or surmise where proof is lacking: ‘I suspect but I cannot prove’. Suspicion arises at or near the starting point of an investigation of which the obtaining of prima facie proof is at the end.” 79.Where a person is arrested for an offence without a warrant, or under a warrant not endorsed for bail, the custody officer at the police station where he is detained after his arrest must determine whether he has sufficient evidence to charge the person for the offence for which he has been arrested (section37(1)(b) of the 1984 Act). In reaching this decision the custody officer must have “reasonable and probable” cause to prosecute. In Hicks v. Faulkner [1878] 8 Queen’s Bench Division at p. 167, JudgeHawkins interpreted this requirement to mean: “… an honest belief in the guilt of the accused based upon a full conviction, founded upon reasonable grounds, of the existence of a state of circumstances, which, assuming them to be true, would reasonably lead any ordinary prudent and cautious man, placed in the position of the accuser to the conclusion that the person was probably guilty of the crime imputed.” 80.The custody officer is not required to be sure that the accused person is guilty before charging him (Tempest v. Snowden [1952] 1 King’s Bench Reports at p. 130). Nor is it necessary for a charging officer to believe that the prosecution will result in a conviction (Dawson v. Vasandau [1863] 11 Weekly Reporter at p. 516). The charging officer is simply required to make an assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence to withstand examination in the course of “a fair and impartial trial” (Glinski v. McIver [1962] Appeal Cases at p.726). 81.If the custody officer does not have sufficient evidence to charge, the arrested person must be released either on bail or without bail. However, if the custody officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect’s detention is necessary to secure or preserve evidence relating to an offence for which he is under arrest or to obtain such evidence by questioning him, the custody officer may authorise the suspect’s further detention (section37(2) of the 1984 Act). 82.In determining whether to bring criminal charges against a person, the custody officer may take into account evidence disclosing a pattern of offending. However, in D.P.P. v. P. [1991] 2 Appeal Cases at p. 447 the House of Lords stated that admissibility of such evidence is to be determined by the degree of its probative worth. The Lord Chancellor, LordMackay of Clashfern, said: “… the essential feature of evidence which is to be admitted is that its probative force in support of the allegation that an accused person committed a crime is sufficiently great to make it just to admit the evidence notwithstanding that it is prejudicial to the accused in tending to show that he was guilty of another crime… Once the principle is recognised that what has to be assessed is the probative force of the evidence in question, the infinite variety of circumstances in which the question arises demonstrates that there is no single manner in which this can be achieved. Whether the evidence has sufficient probative weight to outweigh its prejudicial effect must in each case be a question of fact and degree.” (at p. 460) He continued: “Where the identity of the perpetrator is in issue, and evidence of this kind is important in that connection, obviously something in the nature of what has been called in the course of argument a signature or other special feature will be necessary. To transpose this requirement to other situations where the question is whether a crime has been committed, rather than who did commit it, is to impose an unnecessary and improper restriction upon the application of the principle.” (at p. 462) 83.Section38 of the 1984 Act provides that where an arrested person is charged with an offence, the custody officer shall order his release from police detention, either on bail or without bail, unless, inter alia, his name or address cannot be ascertained; detention is necessary for the person’s own protection or to prevent him causing physical injury to any other person or damage to property; or the person arrested will fail to appear in court to answer bail. 84.If the custody officer decides not to release the defendant, he must be produced before a Magistrates’ Court within 24 hours after his arrest who shall either commit him in custody or release him on bail. Pursuant to section13 of Schedule 1 Part 1 to the Bail Act 1976: “The defendant need not be granted bail if the court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that the defendant, if released on bail (whether subject to conditions or not) would – (a)fail to surrender to custody, or (b)commit an offence while on bail, or (c)interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice, either in relation to himself or any other person.” In taking this decision the Magistrates’ Court is required, pursuant to section9 of Schedule 1 Part 1, to have regard to such of the following considerations as appear to it to be relevant, namely: “(a)the nature and seriousness of the offence…; (b)the character, antecedents, associations and community ties of the defendant; (c)the defendant’s record as respects the fulfilment of his obligations under previous grants of bail in criminal proceedings; (d)except in the case of a defendant whose case is adjourned for inquiries or a report, the strength of the evidence of his having committed the offence or having defaulted.” 85.Section136 of the Mental Health Act 1983 provides: “(1)If a constable finds in a place to which the public have access a person who appears to him to be suffering from mental disorder and to be in immediate need of care or control, the constable may, if he thinks it necessary to do so in the interests of that person, or for the protection of other persons, remove that person to a place of safety… (2)A person removed to a place of safety under this section may be detained there for a period not exceeding 72 hours for the purpose of enabling him to be examined by a registered medical practitioner and to be interviewed by an approved social worker and of making any necessary arrangements for his treatment or care.” 86.Both the Magistrates’ Court and the Crown Court have the power to remand an accused person to a specified hospital for the preparation of a report on his mental condition. Section35(2) defines an accused person as follows: “(a)in relation to the Crown Court, any person who is awaiting trial before the court for an offence punishable with imprisonment or who has been arraigned before the court for such an offence and has not yet been sentenced or otherwise dealt with for the offence on which he has been arraigned; (b)in relation to a Magistrates’ Court any person who has been convicted by the court of an offence punishable on summary conviction with imprisonment and any person charged with such an offence if the court is satisfied that he did the act or made the omission charged or he has consented to the exercise by the court of the powers conferred by this section.” If these requirements are met the court may, pursuant to section35(3), remand the accused person to a hospital for a report if: “(a)the court is satisfied on the written or oral evidence of a registered medical practitioner, that there is reason to suspect that the accused person is suffering from mental illness, psychopathic disorder, severe mental impairment or mental impairment; and (b)the court is of the opinion that it would be impracticable for a report on his mental condition to be made if he were remanded on bail…” 87.The Crown Court may remand an accused person to a specified hospital for treatment, if it is satisfied on the evidence of two medical practitioners that he is suffering from mental illness or severe mental impairment of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be so detained (section36(1)). 88.Following conviction for an offence punishable with imprisonment, both the Magistrates’ Court and the Crown Court have the power under section38(1) to make an interim hospital order, where: “… the court before or by which he is convicted is satisfied, on the written or oral evidence of two registered medical practitioners (a)that the offender is suffering from mental illness, psychopathic disorder, severe mental impairment or mental impairment; and (b)that there is reason to suppose that the mental disorder from which the offender is suffering is such that it may be appropriate for a hospital order to be made in his case…” Pursuant to section37(2) both the Magistrates’ Court and the Crown Court may also admit an offender to a hospital if: “(a)the court is satisfied, on the written or oral evidence of two registered medical practitioners, that the offender is suffering from mental illness, psychopathic disorder, severe mental impairment or mental impairment and that… (b)the court is of the opinion, having regard to all the circumstances including the nature of the offence and the character and antecedents of the offender, and to the other available methods of dealing with him, that the most suitable method of disposing of the case is by means of an order under this section.” 89.In the case of Dorset Yacht Co. Ltd v. the Home Office ([1970] Appeal Cases at p. 1004), the owners of a yacht damaged by borstal boys who had escaped from the supervision of prison officers sought to sue the Home Office alleging negligence by the prison officers. The House of Lords held that in the particular case a duty of care could arise. Lord Diplock said: “I should therefore hold that any duty of a borstal officer to use reasonable care to prevent a borstal trainee from escaping from his custody was owed only to persons whom he could reasonably foresee had property situated in the vicinity of the place of detention of the detainee which the detainee was likely to steal or to appropriate and damage in the course of eluding immediate pursuit and capture.” 90.In the case of Hill v. Chief Constable of West Yorkshire ([1989] Appeal Cases at p. 53), the mother of a victim of the Yorkshire Ripper instituted proceedings against the police alleging that they had failed properly to exercise their duty to exercise all reasonable care and skill to apprehend the perpetrator of the murders and to protect members of the public who might be his victims. Lord Keith in the House of Lords found: “The alleged negligence of the police consists in a failure to discover his identity. But if there is no general duty of care owed to individual members of the public by the responsible authorities to prevent the escape of a known criminal or to recapture him, there cannot reasonably be imposed upon any police force a duty of care similarly to identify and apprehend an unknown one. Miss Hill cannot for this purpose be regarded as a person at special risk simply because she was young and female. Where the class of potential victims of a particular habitual criminal is a large one the precise size of it cannot in principle affect the issue. All householders are potential victims of an habitual burglar and all females those of an habitual rapist. The conclusion must be that although there existed reasonable foreseeability of likely harm to Miss Hill if Sutcliffe were not identified and apprehended, there is absent from the case any such ingredient or characteristic as led to the liability of the Home Secretary in the Dorset Yacht case. Nor is there present any additional characteristic such as might make up a deficiency. The circumstances of the case are therefore not capable of establishing a duty of care owed towards Miss Hill by the West Yorkshire Police.” 91.While he considered this sufficient to dispose of the appeal, LordKeith went on to set out public-policy objections to the existence of an action in negligence against the police in the performance of their duties in the investigation and suppression of crime. “Potential existence of such liability may in many instances be in the general public interest, as tending towards the observance of a higher standard of care in the carrying on of various different types of activity. I do not, however, consider that this can be said of police activities. The general sense of public duty which motivates police forces is unlikely to be appreciably reinforced by the imposition of such liability so far as concerns their function in the investigation and suppression of crime. From time to time they make mistakes in the exercise of that function, but it is not to be doubted that they apply their best endeavours to the performance of it. In some instances the imposition of liability may lead to the exercise of a function being carried on in a detrimentally defensive frame of mind. The possibility of this happening in relation to the investigative operations of the police cannot be excluded. Further it would be reasonable to expect that if potential liability were to be imposed it would be not uncommon for actions to be raised against police forces on the ground that they had failed to catch some criminal as soon as they might have done, with the result that he went on to commit further crimes. While some such actions might involve allegations of a simple and straightforward type of failure – for example that a police officer negligently tripped and fell while pursuing a burglar – others would be likely to enter deeply into the general nature of a police investigation, as indeed the present action would seek to do. The manner of conduct of such an investigation must necessarily involve a variety of decisions to be made on matters of policy and discretion, for example as to which particular line of inquiry is most advantageously to be pursued and what is the most advantageous way to deploy the available resources. Many such decisions would not be regarded by the courts as appropriate to be called in question, yet elaborate investigation of the facts might be necessary to ascertain whether or not this was so. A great deal of police time, trouble and expense might be expected to have to be put into the preparation of the defence to the action and the attendance of witnesses at the trial. The result would be significant diversion of police manpower and attention from their most important function, that of the suppression of crime. Closed investigations would require to be reopened and retraversed, not with the object of bringing any criminal to justice but to ascertain whether or not they had been competently conducted.” 92.Lord Templeman commented: “... if this action lies, every citizen will be able to require the court to investigate the performance of every policeman. If the policeman concentrates on one crime, he may be accused of neglecting others. If the policeman does not arrest on suspicion a suspect with previous convictions, the police force may be held liable for subsequent crimes. The threat of litigation against a police force would not make a policeman more efficient. The necessity for defending proceedings, successfully or unsuccessfully, would distract the policeman from his duties. This action is misconceived and will do more harm than good.” 93.In Swinney and another v. the Chief Constable of Northumbria ([1997] Queen’s Bench Reports at p. 464), the plaintiff had passed on information in confidence to the police about the identity of a person implicated in the killing of a police officer, expressing her concern that she did not want the source of the information to be traced back to her. The information was recorded, naming the plaintiff, in a document which was left in an unattended police vehicle, which was broken into with the result that the document was stolen, came into the possession of the person implicated and the plaintiff was threatened with violence and arson and suffered psychiatric damage. The plaintiff’s claim in negligence against the police was struck out but allowed on appeal by the High Court judge. The Chief Constable appealed contending that the police owed no duty of care or alternatively that public policy precluded the prosecution of the claim since the police were immune for claims arising out of their activities in the investigation or suppression of crime. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. In his judgment Lord Justice Hirst referring to the cases of Dorset Yacht and Hill (see paragraphs 89–92 above) stated that he could not accept a claim of blanket immunity for the police in this case, but that there were other considerations of public policy in this case, namely, the need to protect springs of information, to protect informers and to encourage them to come forward. On the facts of the case, it was arguable that the police had assumed a responsibility of confidentiality towards the plaintiff. The case should therefore proceed to trial. 94.Lord Justice Ward held that it was arguable that: “There is a special relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant, which is sufficiently proximate. Proximity is shown by the police assuming responsibility, and the plaintiffs relying upon that assumption of responsibility, for preserving the confidentiality of the information which, if it fell into the wrong hands, was likely to expose the first plaintiff and members of her family to a special risk of damage from the criminal acts of others, greater than the general risk which ordinary members of the public must endure with phlegmatic fortitude. It is fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty, there being no overwhelming dictate of public policy to exclude the prosecution of this claim. On the one hand there is, as more fully set out in Hill v. the Chief Constable ... an important public interest that the police should carry out their difficult duties to the best of their endeavours without being fettered by, or even influenced by, the spectre of litigation looming over every judgment they make, every discretion they exercise, every act they undertake or omit to perform, in their ceaseless battle to investigate and suppress crime. The greater good rightly outweighs any individual hardship. On the other hand it is incontrovertible that the fight against crime is daily dependent upon information fed to the police by members of the public, often at real risk of villainous retribution from the criminals and their associates. The public interest will not accept that good citizens should be expected to entrust information to the police without also expecting that they are entrusting their safety to the police. The public interest would be affronted were it to be the law that members of the public should be expected, in the execution of public service, to undertake the risk of harm to themselves without the police, in return, being expected to take no more than reasonable care to ensure that the confidential information imparted to them is protected...” 95.The police have been held liable in negligence or failure in their duties in other cases. In Kirkham v. the Chief Constable of Manchester ([1989] 2 Queen’s Bench Reports at p. 283), the Court of Appeal upheld a finding of liability in negligence under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 where the police had taken a man into custody, knew he was a suicide risk but did not communicate that information to the prison authorities. The man, diagnosed as suffering from clinical depression had committed suicide in remand prison. The police, which had assumed responsibility for the man, had owed a duty of care, which they had breached with the result that his death had ensued. 96.In Rigby and another v. Chief Constable of Northamptonshire ([1985] 2 All England Law Reports at p. 986), the High Court found the police liable to pay damages for negligence in that they had fired a gas canister into the plaintiffs’ premises in order to flush out a dangerous psychopath. There had been a real and substantial fire risk in firing the canister into the building and that risk was only acceptable if there was firefighting equipment available to put the fire out at an early stage. No equipment had been present at the time and the fire had broken out and spread very quickly. Negligence was also found in Knightley v. Johns and others ([1982] 1 All England Law Reports at p. 301) where a police inspector at the site of an accident failed to close a tunnel and ordered officers to go back through the tunnel in the face of traffic, thereby leading to a further accident. 97.In R. v. Dytham ([1979] 1 Queen’s Bench Reports at p. 722), where a police officer stood by while a man died outside a club in a murderous assault, the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction of the officer for wilful neglect to perform a duty.",1998,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

111,001-61075,Grand Chamber,"11.The applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Rome. 12.He is a journalist by profession and on 21 November 1993 he published in the Italian daily newspaper Il Giornale an article about MrG.Caselli, who was at that time the Principal Public Prosecutor in Palermo. The article was entitled “Caselli, the judge with the white quiff” and subtitled “Catholic schooling, communist militancy like his friend Violante – Are the charges against Andreotti the start of a new Sogno case?”. 13.In the article the applicant, after referring to the proceedings brought by Mr Caselli against Mr G. Andreotti, a very well-known Italian statesman accused of aiding and abetting the Mafia (appoggio esterno alla mafia) who has in the meantime been acquitted at first instance, expressed himself as follows: “In the last few days Giulio Andreotti has told an Israeli newspaper that he fears he is to be eliminated. If I may be permitted to begin with a digression, I wonder why he was talking to a foreign paper rather than the Italian press. He’s not the only one. It’s getting to be an epidemic. During the same period the industrialist Carlo De Benedetti chose an English newspaper in which to say that Italy is his Siberia. Even Bettino Craxi, when he feels like uttering threats or complaints, generally does so via the Spanish papers. This might be a form of gratuitous snobbery. But it might also be a victimisation syndrome of the type ‘We’re foreigners in our own country and are obliged to raise our voices abroad in order to make ourselves heard at home.’ That’s what Andreotti is suggesting when he adds that he feels like an exile and the victim of a plot, but he doesn’t exactly know what kind of plot. Those who have seen him recently say that he’s pale, his pointed ears are drooping and he’s bent forward to the point of being hunchbacked. He’s worried about his wife Lidia, who’s been plunged in a kind of cataleptic trance since that fateful 27 March. That was the day when the official notification that he was under investigation – a document running to some 250 typewritten pages – turned the most well known Italian politician into the number one godfather of the Sicilian Mafia. Now Andreotti is bewildered. He tries to understand but he can’t. He thinks there must have been some sort of spur-of-the-moment conspiracy. But the antibody that’s eating away at him has been there for some time. It’s been cultured for years in precisely those religious environments that Andreotti likes best. While he was already dominating Rome in the 1950s Giancarlo Caselli, the Principal Public Prosecutor in Palermo, author of the 250 pages which have annihilated him, was learning his lessons at the school of the Salesian brothers in Turin. Giancarlo was a fine, studious boy. Turin is full of people like that because it’s a rainy city and the houses have no balconies to watch the street from, so there’s nothing else for a boy to do but get his head down over his books. That’s why the place specialises in the mass-production of intellectuals. From Bobbio to Conso, the Minister of Justice. It’s a puritan brotherhood. The more Giancarlo progressed towards self-knowledge the heavier his complex about his father weighed on him. The father was a very worthy man but only the chauffeur of a captain of industry. While driving he breathed in the air of the bourgeoisie and then he blew it out again over his son. The boy decided that when he grew up he would pass over to the other side of the fence. No longer subservient like dad, but keeping the upper hand. At university, he drew close to the PCI [the Italian Communist Party], the party which exalts the frustrated. When he was admitted to the State legal service he swore a threefold oath of obedience – to God, to the Law and to via Botteghe Oscure [formerly the headquarters of the PCI, now those of the PDS – the Democratic Party of the Left]. And Giancarlo became the judge he has remained for the last thirty years – pious, stern and partisan. But he cannot really be understood without a mention here of his alter ego Luciano Violante, Caselli’s twin brother. Both from Turin; the same age – 52; both raised by the Catholic teaching orders; both communist militants; both judicial officers; and a deep understanding between them: when Violante, the head, calls, Caselli, the arm, responds. Luciano has always been one step ahead of Giancarlo. In the mid-1970s he indicted for an attempted coup d’état Edgardo Sogno, a former member of the Resistance, but also an anti-communist. It was a typical political trial which led nowhere. Instead of facing a judicial inquiry, Violante found that his career began to take off. In 1979 he was elected as a Communist MP. And ever since then he has been the via Botteghe Oscure’s shadow Minister of Justice. Today he’s the chairman of Parliament’s anti-Mafia committee, the great choreographer of the to-ing and fro-ing of the pentiti [criminals-turned-informers] and the PDS’s strongman. While Violante was climbing the ladder, Caselli had turned into a handsome figure with the shock of prematurely white hair he’s so proud of. If he goes away anywhere, even on a short trip, he always takes his hairdryer with him. During breaks in proceedings he pats his quiff into place on his forehead and pushes his hair over his ears. Afterwards, as you will have noticed on TV, he moves his head the bare minimum, so as not to ruin his handiwork. Vain – he’s vain. When Giancarlo was a member of the National Council of the Judiciary, from 1986 to 1990, his colleagues used to make fun of him, saying ‘Under his hair there’s nothing there’. That’s true up to a point, as a comment on his narcissism and his ideological blinkers. But it’s not true as regards his intelligence, which cannot be faulted. So far, as can be seen, there’s nothing to suggest that one day Caselli’s and Andreotti’s paths would cross. Apart from his spell at the National Council of the Judiciary, Giancarlo continued to live in Turin. He was a judge in the public eye and in the first line of the battle against terrorism. It was he who obtained the confession of Patrizio Peci, whose evidence as a witness for the prosecution devastated the Red Brigades. In the meantime, the PCI set in motion its strategy for gaining control of the public prosecutors’ offices of every city in Italy. That campaign is still going on, as the PDS has picked up the baton. The whole thing was the product of two linked but very very simple ideas Violante had. The first idea was that if the Communists could not manage to gain power through the ballot box, they could do so through the courts. There was no shortage of material. The Christian Democrats and the Socialists were nothing but thieves and it would be easy to catch them out. The second idea was more brilliant than the first: the opening of a judicial investigation was sufficient to shatter people’s careers; there was no need to go to the trouble of a trial, it was enough to put someone in the pillory. And to do that it was necessary to control the entire network of public prosecutors’ offices. And that was the start of Tangentopoli. The Craxis, De Lorenzos and others were immediately caught with their hands in the till and destroyed. But Andreotti was needed to complete the picture. More cunning than the rest, or not so greedy, the sly old Christian Democrat nearly always avoided getting caught up in corruption cases. It was at that precise moment that Giancarlo was getting ready to leave the rain of Turin for the sun of Palermo. A campaign of unsubstantiated allegations saw off the incumbent public prosecutor Giammanco, who crept away with his tail between his legs. And at the start of this year the handsome judge was able to take Giammanco’s place and finally place Violante’s seal on the Palermo prosecution service. Before he took up his new post Caselli was summoned to the Quirinale [the President’s official residence]. President Scalfaro, knowing the type, was concerned. When he had Caselli in front of him he said: ‘Do whatever you think is right, but be objective.’ Once in Palermo his fate and Andreotti’s, which had remained separate for years, became intertwined. Less than two months later the senator-for-life was suddenly accused of belonging to the Mafia. The file was an implausible rag-bag containing statements by pentiti, old and new documents and information given by the same old Buscetta [a pentito] to Violante and the anti-Mafia committee, now used by Caselli as evidence in a kind of game of ping-pong between the two twins. To cut a long story short, even the most long-lived brontosaurus in the Palazzo [i.e. Palazzo Madama – the Senate-House] was destroyed, thanks to the principle that an accusation is sufficient to destroy anyone. In April Caselli flew off to the United States, where he met Buscetta. He offered the informer 11,000,000 lire a month to continue to cooperate. Buscetta could still be useful to him during the investigation, even if the outcome was no longer of much importance. The result sought had already been achieved. What will happen next is already predictable. In six to eight months’ time the investigation will be closed. But Andreotti will not be able to resurrect his political career. What a stroke of luck. Caselli, on the other hand, will be portrayed as an objective judge whose duty obliged him to prosecute but who realised he had been in the wrong. He will become a hero. And that, if there is a God, cries out for vengeance.” 14.On 10 March 1994, acting on a complaint by Mr Caselli, the judge responsible for preliminary investigations committed the applicant and the manager of Il Giornale for trial in the Monza District Court. The applicant was accused of defamation through the medium of the press (diffamazione a mezzo stampa), aggravated by the fact that the offence had been committed to the detriment of a civil servant in the performance of his official duties. 15.At the trial on 10 January 1996 the civil party asked for the report on the evidence given by Buscetta to the New York judicial authorities and a copy of the Italian weekly newspaper l’Espresso in which that evidence had been published to be added to the file. The defence asked for two press articles concerning Mr Caselli’s professional relations with the pentito Buscetta to be added to the file and for the complainant to be required to give evidence. In an order made on the same day the District Court refused these requests on the grounds that the documents in question were not relevant to the object of the proceedings (defamation) and that there was no point taking evidence from Mr Caselli in view of the tenor of the article written by the applicant. 16.On the same day, applying Article 57, Article 595 §§ 1 and 2 and Article 61 § 10 of the Criminal Code and section 13 of the Press Act (Law no. 47 of 8February 1948), the District Court sentenced the manager of Il Giornale and the applicant to fines of 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 Italian lire (ITL) respectively, payment of damages and costs in the sum of ITL60,000,000, payment of the civil party’s costs and publication of the judgment in Il Giornale. In its reasoning the District Court included the following considerations: “... The author of this article, taking as his theme the case against Senator Giulio Andreotti, gave a biography of the complainant in terms which emphasised his cultural background and above all his ideological leanings – allegedly close to the PCI (now the PDS) – contending that these leanings had decisively influenced [the complainant’s] professional activity to the extent of making him the instrument of a grand design of that party, namely to take control of the judicial organs, particularly the public prosecutors’ offices. Mr Perna stressed the long-standing friendship between the complainant and the MP Violante, asserting that the latter acted as the head in a strategy where Mr Caselli was the arm. He added to his summary biography phrases with a particularly striking literal meaning such as: ‘When he was admitted to the State Legal Service he swore a threefold oath of obedience – to God, to the Law and to via Botteghe Oscure. And Giancarlo became the judge he has remained for the last thirty years – pious, stern and partisan.’ He accused Mr Caselli of having managed ‘the Andreotti investigation’ in furtherance of a grand political design hatched by Violante on behalf of the PCI/PDS, which was to break up by judicial process the dominant political class at the time, so that the favoured party could take power by non-electoral means. He suggested that the charges against Mr Andreotti, the last politician of any standing not to have been laid low by the ‘clean hands’ [mani pulite] inquiries in progress, should be seen in the context of that exploitation of the investigation. ... The defamatory nature of the article ... is absolutely manifest, given that the text categorically excluded the possibility that Mr Caselli might be faithful to the deontological obligations of his duties as an officer in the State legal service and denied that he possessed the qualities of impartiality, independence, objectivity and probity which characterise the exercise of judicial functions, an activity which the complainant was even alleged to have used for political ends, according to the author of the article. In the present case exercise of the right to report current events cannot be pleaded as an extenuating circumstance, Mr Perna not having adduced the slightest evidence in support of his very serious allegations. Nor can he rely on exercise of the right to comment on them – a right which would certainly be enjoyed by a journalist who, in reporting court proceedings, criticises this or that measure – given that the offending assertions in the article amount to nothing more than an unjustified attack on the complainant, which foully besmirched his honour and reputation. ...” 17.The applicant appealed. Relying on the freedom of the press, and in particular the right to report and comment on current events, he contended, among other arguments, that what he had written about Mr Caselli’s political leanings was true and that the court could have verified that by agreeing to take evidence from the complainant himself; that Caselli and Violante were indeed friends; and that it was likewise true that Caselli had used the help of the pentito Buscetta in the proceedings against Andreotti, and, as the representative of the State, had paid him sums of money, all pentiti being remunerated by the Italian State. Describing himself in addition as an opinion columnist (opinionista), he asserted that he had not intended to give a biography of Caselli but rather to express his critical opinions, in a figurative and forceful way. More precisely, he had made critical judgments, which were admittedly more or less well founded and with which readers might or might not agree, but which were explicitly derived from the factual premise, namely Caselli’s political activity. Lastly, he demanded that evidence be taken from the complainant and from certain journalists and figures in Italian politics who, like Mr Caselli, had been Communist Party militants. In particular, he asked for evidence to be taken from Mr S. Vertone and Mr G. Ferrara and for press articles on interviews in which the two men had confirmed the complainant’s active political militancy to be added to the file. In particular, in an interview published in the daily newspaper Corriere della Sera on 11 December 1994, extracts from which were quoted in the applicant’s appeal, Mr Vertone had stated, inter alia, that the complainant was a brave man of great integrity but that he was influenced by the cultural and political model of communism, that his relations with the former Communist Party had been very close and that he had later all but joined the party. In an interview given to another daily newspaper, La Stampa, which published it on 9 December 1994, Mr Ferrara had asserted that he had taken part in dozens of political meetings with Caselli and Violante among others during the 1970s in the Turin federation of the former Communist Party. He had gone on to say that although Caselli, a man of integrity, had done good work against terrorism as an officer of the State legal service, he was heavily politicised and should therefore avoid speaking like a tribune of the people. 18.In a judgment of 28 October 1997 the Milan Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal, ruling as follows: “... the statements noted in the charges ... are undeniably seriously damaging to the reputation of the injured party. They go further than casting doubt – as the charges say – on Mr Caselli’s loyalty to the country’s institutions, his faithfulness to the principle of legality, his objectivity and his independence; they categorically deny that he possesses those qualities and even attribute to him, among other accusations, instances of conduct which constitute disciplinary and criminal offences.” The Court of Appeal held that it was evident that the article essentially referred to facts, some of which were not in the least defamatory and were therefore not relevant to the decision to be taken. “In particular, the following elements are undeniably facts (not judgments), and one of the appeal pleadings (from lawyer D’A.) refers to them as such: (i)Giancarlo Caselli’s political leanings; (ii)the friendship between Mr Caselli and MP Violante; (iii)the information that as public prosecutor in Palermo Mr Caselli used the statements of the criminal-turned-informer Buscetta in the investigation concerning Mr Andreotti, and the information that the same Buscetta, like other pentiti, is paid by the State. Those elements are facts and in itself merely stating them is not in the least defamatory; they are therefore not relevant to the decision this Court has to take. That seems quite obvious as regards the last two pieces of information above, but is also true of the first (Giancarlo Caselli’s political leanings), since the State guarantees not only freedom of thought and the freedom to express thoughts but also the freedom of association in political parties. It is therefore not relevant to try to ascertain what political beliefs Giancarlo Caselli holds and whether or not he expressed them in specific circumstances (and at all events outside the judicial sphere and the performance of his duties) since that information could not in any case be considered defamatory in itself... There is therefore no basis for the request that the proceedings be reopened, firstly so that Giancarlo Caselli can be heard as a witness, and secondly to obtain the production of the press articles of Saverio Vertone and Giuliano Ferrara, but also so that witness evidence can be taken from them, once again on the subject of [Caselli’s] political militancy or at any rate of [his] ... political participation in the PCI/PDS. First of all, that information, as has already been said, is barely touched upon in the article, and in the second place it cannot in any event be regarded as damaging to the complainant’s reputation and accordingly does not need to be verified.” 19.Other facts imputed to the complainant were, on the contrary, undeniably defamatory. First of all, there was the oath of obedience, which, beyond its symbolic import, bore the precise accusation that Mr Caselli had given a personal and lasting undertaking to “obey”, in the course of his duties, the law, his religious beliefs and “the instructions of the leaders” of a political party. The Court of Appeal continued: “The remainder of the article, which gives a highly defamatory account of MrCaselli’s alleged obedience to the Communist Party, confirms that the journalist was not expressing judgments or personal opinions but imputing specific conduct to Mr Caselli. Further on the article asserts (i)that Mr Caselli is Mr Violante’s twin brother, ... (ii)that the PCI ... set in motion a strategy of seizing control of all the public prosecutors’ offices in Italy by applying two of the MP’s ideas, the first being to gain power ... by using the judicial machine and the second to resort simply to opening a judicial investigation ... in order to destroy the careers [of political opponents] since there was no need to go to the trouble of a trial, it was enough to put someone in the pillory. It is in that context that the journalist referred to two actions by Giancarlo Caselli: his request for a transfer to the Palermo public prosecutor’s office and subsequent appointment to the post of public prosecutor there and his notification to Mr Andreotti that he faced prosecution for belonging to a Mafia-type organisation. ... The journalist Perna did not therefore express opinions or judgments but attributed to the complainant Giancarlo Caselli in a highly defamatory manner conduct and acts about which – and here we can only repeat what the District Court said – he did not adduce a scrap of evidence; he did not even seek to prove his case, as his lawyers argue that he was merely expressing opinions. ... The journalist [having] attributed specific acts to public prosecutor Giancarlo Caselli without verifying his assertions in any way and in a totally gratuitous manner, his conduct cannot be explained by errors or misunderstandings, but only as a deliberate act. That is confirmed by the literal content of the whole article, in which the person of Giancarlo Caselli is constantly and subtly denigrated, even though a few positive remarks are skilfully mixed in with the attacks. ... The content of the whole article shows that there was no unintentional fault on the defendant’s part but that he was fully aware that he was damaging another’s reputation and even that he intended to do so.” 20.In a judgment of 9 October 1998, deposited with the registry on 3December 1998, the Court of Cassation upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment, ruling that it was quite correct both as regards the merits and from the procedural point of view. “... Contrary to what has been alleged, the requests for leave to adduce evidence filed by the defence were interpreted in accordance with their exact significance and probative value and were rightly refused because they were totally devoid of relevance to the decision. The appeal written and signed jointly by the defendant Perna and his lawyer MrCaiazza contains a request for the proceedings to be reopened, with a view, firstly, to ‘taking witness evidence from the civil party’, in particular ‘about the forms and modalities of his militancy, or at least of his political participation in the activities of the PCI/PDS during the period when he was already a public prosecutor, and about all the other points which offended the complainant’. The absolutely vague and irrelevant nature of the request is manifest in the light of the tenor of the phrases used by Mr Perna (in whose article the allusion to Mr Caselli’s militancy is by no means limited, as Mr Caiazza argued in the grounds of appeal, to the assertion that Mr Caselli associated himself with the Communist Party while he was at university, an assertion which would, incidentally, not constitute an insult); the article set out to give a detailed account of the forms taken by that militancy by imputing certain acts to Mr Caselli with the aim of proving that his militancy existed. Consequently, either this point remains vague or the problem is resolved by trying to make the complainant admit the facts noted in the charges, with the result that the burden of proof is shifted away from [Mr Perna and Mr Montanelli]. ... Moreover, the ‘direct witnesses’, Giuliano Ferrara and Saverio Vertone, are mentioned in connection with the above point [the forms taken by the complainant’s militancy]; what has just been said about the vagueness and irrelevance of that point therefore applies equally to those persons. Furthermore, giving further details about facts of which they had direct knowledge would have had no bearing on the trial since these were assertions which the trial court did not consider offensive and to speak of this as exculpatory evidence is accordingly meaningless. Lastly, Mr Caselli’s militancy within the PCI has nothing to do with the specific facts attributed to him, and therefore with his alleged oath of obedience to via Botteghe Oscure (to which, however, this ground of appeal makes no allusion), with the relations between Caselli and Violante and above all with an alleged link with Buscetta. Apart from the procedural aspect of the question, it should be stated at the outset that even the argument that the content of the article was not objectively offensive is absolutely devoid of foundation, as the judgment given by the trial court was justified in every respect as regards the offensive nature, for a man even more than for an officer of the State legal service, of imputations of specific facts implying a lack of personality, dignity, independent thought, coherence and moral honesty, and conduct signifying explicitly that there have been instances of dereliction of professional duty. ... The trial court’s reasoning on the extenuating circumstances of the right to report current events and the right to comment on them is also correct, as evidenced by an appropriate statement of the reasons which was free of mistakes in law and errors of logic. No link can be established, and moreover no link was established by the Court of Appeal, between the personality [of Mr Caselli] and an alleged right to report current events exercised through the offensive imputation of facts which have not been proved to be true and play no informative role. The essential point in the judgment is its categorical exclusion of the idea that the article expressed a critical judgment, hence the rejection of the plea that the right to freedom of expression constituted an extenuating circumstance. And in fact it is precisely by virtue of this comparative parameter and of its accessory powers of cognition that this court must repeat that the reasons given [by the Court of Appeal] are immune to criticism: the article is quite clearly a bare list of acts and conduct imputed to Mr Caselli in which there cannot be seen, even in veiled form, the slightest contribution to thought which might be regarded as a critical judgment, or even the attempt at irony which is said to be hidden in the elusive ‘caustic phrases’ referred to in the grounds of appeal. As the Court of Appeal concluded, this case was not about respect for the limits of formal propriety. It follows from all of the foregoing considerations that, as it is impossible to speak of critical comment, there is no cause to expatiate about exercise of the right to comment, still less about the extenuating circumstance of gross negligence in the exercise of the right to comment or about the hypothetical exercise of that right. ...”",2003,0,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT

119,001-72930,Grand Chamber,"12.The applicant was born in 1924 and lives in Pianello Val Tidone (). 13.On 8 April 1974 the applicant sued Mr P. in the Piacenza District Court seeking damages for the loss she had sustained as a result of works carried out by her neighbour which had resulted, among other things, in sewage being dumped on her property. 14.Preparation of the case for trial began on 11 May 1974. Of the sixty- six hearings listed between 11 November 1974 and 15 June 1995 nineteen were adjourned at the request of the parties, three at the request of the applicant, two at the request of Mr P., four by the court of its own motion, and one on account of a lawyers’ strike; twelve were devoted to organising expert evidence, twelve to the filing of documents and the hearing of witnesses, twelve to attempts to seek a friendly settlement, and one was adjourned in order to allow the parties to make their submissions. 15.In the meantime Mr P.’s lawyer had filed a death certificate with the registry in respect of his client. At a hearing on 29 February 1996 the judge declared the proceedings interrupted. The proceedings were resumed on 25September 1996 and the judge fixed 11 June 1998 as the date for hearing submissions. On an unspecified date the case was referred to the bench of judges dealing with the oldest cases (sezioni stralcio). At a hearing on 18November 1999 the parties requested that a date be fixed for hearing oral submissions and the judge adjourned the case to 8 June 2000. The hearing was not held on that date, but adjourned to 12June 2000. On that date judgment was reserved. 16.In a judgment of 23 October 2000, the text of which was deposited with the registry on the same day, the allowed the applicant’s claim in part and ordered Mr P.’s heir to move the septic tank that had not been installed at the prescribed distance and to replace part of the applicant’s sullage pipes. It also awarded her 15,000,000 Italian lire (7,747euros (EUR)). 17.On 17 October 2001 the applicant lodged an application with the Ancona Court of Appeal under Law no.89 of 24March2001, known as the “Pinto Act”, complaining of the excessive length of the above-described proceedings. The applicant requested the court to conclude that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to order the Italian Government to pay compensation for the non-pecuniary damage sustained. The applicant claimed 200,000,000 Italian lire (EUR103,291.37) in non-pecuniary damages and an unquantified amount for costs and expenses. 18.In a decision of 31 January 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 13 February 2002, the Court of Appeal found that the proceedings had been excessively long. It held as follows: The Court of Appeal dismissed the claim for pecuniary damages on the ground that the applicant had failed to substantiate it, awarded her EUR5,000 on an equitable basis in compensation for non-pecuniary damage and EUR860 for costs and expenses. The decision was served on the applicant on 13 March 2002. 19.The applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation against that decision on 21May 2002 on the ground that the amount awarded her by the Court of Appeal was inadequate. 20.However, in a judgment of 12 November 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 3 January 2003, the Court of Cassation declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that it had been lodged out of time. The authorities paid the amounts due on 23 December 2003. 21.In a letter of 25 August 2003 the applicant informed the Court of the outcome of the domestic proceedings and asked it to resume its examination of her application. 22.Award of just satisfaction in the event of a breach of the requirement to dispose of proceedings within a reasonable time and amendment to Article 375 of the Code of Civil Procedure “1.Anyone sustaining pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage as a result of a violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, on account of a failure to comply with the ‘reasonable-time’ requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, shall be entitled to just satisfaction.>In determining whether there has been a violation, the court shall have regard to the complexity of the case and, in the light thereof, the conduct of the parties and of the judge deciding procedural issues, and also the conduct of any authority required to participate in or contribute to the resolution of the case.>The court shall assess the quantum of damage in accordance with Article 2056 of the Civil Code and shall apply the following rules: Section 3 Procedure “1.Claims for just satisfaction shall be lodged with the court of appeal in which the judge sits who has jurisdiction under Article 11 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to try cases concerning members of the judiciary in the district where the case in which the violation is alleged to have occurred was decided or discontinued at the merits stage or is still pending.>The claim shall be made on an application lodged with the registry of the court of appeal by a lawyer holding a special authority containing all the information prescribed by Article 125 of the Code of Civil Procedure.>The application shall be made against the Minister of Justice where the alleged violation has taken place in proceedings in the ordinary courts, the Minister of Defence where it has taken place in proceedings before the military courts and the Finance Minister where it has taken place in proceedings before the tax commissioners.

Claims lodged after that date shall be time-barred.” Section 5 Communications “If the court decides to allow an application, its decision shall be communicated by the registry to the parties, to State Counsel at the Court of Audit to enable him to start an investigation into liability, and to the authorities responsible for deciding whether to institute disciplinary proceedings against the civil servants involved in the proceedings in any capacity.” Section 6 Transitional provisions “1.Within six months after the entry into force of this Act, anyone who has lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights in due time complaining of a violation of the ‘reasonable-time’ requirement contained in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, shall be entitled to lodge a claim under section 3 hereof provided that the application has not by then been declared admissible by the European Court. In such cases, the application to the court of appeal must state when the application to the said was made.>The registry of the relevant court shall inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs without delay of any claim lodged in accordance with section 3 and within the period laid down in subsection 1 of this section.” Section 7 Financial provisions “1.The financial cost of implementing this Act, which is put at 12,705,000,000Italian lire from 2002, shall be met by releasing funds entered in the three-year budget 2001-03 in the chapter concerning the basic current-liability estimates from the ‘special fund’ in the year 2001 forecast of the Ministry of the Treasury, Economy and Financial Planning. Treasury deposits shall be set aside for that purpose. 23.On appeal from decisions delivered by the courts of appeal in “Pinto” proceedings, the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court (Sezioni Unite), gave four judgments (nos. 1338, 1339, 1340 and 1341) on 27November 2003, the texts of which were deposited with the registry on 26January 2004, quashing the appeal court’s decision and remitting the case for a rehearing. It held that “the case-law of the is binding on the Italian courts regarding the application of Law no. 89/2001”. In its judgment no. 1340 it affirmed, inter alia, the principle that 24.Extracts from the plenary Court of Cassation’s judgment no.1339 deposited with the registry on 26 January 2004 “... 2.- The present application poses the fundamental question of what legal effect must be given – in implementing the Law of 24 March 2001 no. 89, and in particular in determining the non-pecuniary damage arising out of the breach of the reasonable length of proceedings requirement – to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, whether considered generally as interpretative guidelines which the said Court has laid down with regard to the consequences of the said violation, or with reference to a specific case in which the European Court has already had occasion to give a judgment on the delay in reaching a decision. ... As stipulated in section 2.1 of the said Law, the legal fact which gives rise to the right to the just satisfaction that it provides for is constituted by the “violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified in accordance with the Law of 4 August 1955 no. 848, for failure to comply with the reasonable time referred to in Article 6, paragraph1 of the Convention.” In other words, Law no. 89/2001 identifies the fact constituting the right to compensation by reference to a specific provision of the European Convention on Human Rights. This Convention instituted a Court (the European Court of Human Rights, with its seat in ) to ensure compliance with the provisions contained therein (Article 19). Accordingly, the competence of the said court to determine, and therefore to interpret, the significance of the said provisions must be recognised. As the fact constituting the right conferred by Law no. 89/2001 consists of a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, it is for the Court of the European Convention on Human Rights to determine all the elements of such a legal fact, which thus ends by being “brought into conformity” by the Strasbourg Court, whose case-law is binding on the Italian courts in so far as the application of Law no. 89/2001 is concerned. It is not necessary therefore to pose the general problem of the relationships between the European Convention on Human Rights and the internal judicial system, which the Advocate-General (Procuratore Generale) has amply discussed in court. Whatever opinion one may have about that controversial issue and therefore about the place of the European Convention on Human Rights in the context of the sources of domestic law, it is certain that the direct implementation in the Italian judicial system of a provision of the European Convention on Human Rights, established by Law no. 89/2001 (that is, by Article 6 § 1 in the part relating to “reasonable time”), cannot diverge from the interpretation which the European Court gives of the same provision. The opposite argument, which would permit a substantial divergence between the application accorded to Law no. 89/2001 in the national system and the interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court to the right to reasonable length of proceedings, would deprive the said Law no. 89/2001 of any justification and cause the Italian State to violate Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, according to which ‘The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention’ (including the said Article 6, which provides for the right to have a case decided within a reasonable length of time). The reason behind the enactment of Law no. 89/2001 was the need to provide a domestic judicial remedy against violations in respect of the duration of proceedings, so as to give effect to the subsidiary character of intervention on the part of the Court of Strasbourg, expressly provided for by the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 35: “the Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted”). The European system for the protection of human rights is founded on the said principle of subsidiarity. From it derives the duty of the States which have ratified the European Convention on Human Rights to guarantee to individuals the protection of the rights recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights, above all in their own internal order and vis-à-vis the organs of the national judicial system. And this protection must be “effective” (Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights), that is, of a kind to remedy the claim without the need for recourse to the . The domestic remedy introduced by Law no. 89/2001 did not previously exist in the Italian system, with the consequence that appeals against in respect of a violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights had “clogged” (the term used by rapporteur Follieri in the sitting of the Senate of 28 September 2000) the . The observed, prior to Law no. 89/2001, that the said failures to comply on the part of “reflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy. This accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention” (see the four judgments of the Court delivered on 28 July in the cases of Bottazzi, Di Mauro, Ferrari and A. P.). Law no. 89/2001 constitutes the domestic remedy to which a “victim of a violation” (as defined by Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights) of Article 6 (failure to comply with the reasonable-time requirement) must have recourse before applying to the European Court to claim the “just satisfaction” provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which, when the violation exists, is only awarded by the Court “if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made”. Law no. 89/2001 has therefore allowed the European Court to declare inadmissible applications lodged with it (including before the Act was passed) and aimed at obtaining just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights for the excessive length of proceedings (Brusco v. Italy, decision of 6 September 2001). This mechanism for implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights and observance of the principle of subsidiarity in respect of interventions of the European Court of Strasbourg does not operate, however, in cases in which the Court holds that the consequences of the established violation of the European Convention on Human Rights have not been redressed by domestic law or that this has been done only “partially”, because in such an event the said Article 41 provides for the intervention of the European Court to protect the “victim of the violation”. In such cases an individual application to the on the basis of Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights is admissible (Scordino and Others v. Italy, decision of 27 March 2003) and the Court acts directly to protect the rights of the victim whom it considers not to have been adequately protected by domestic law. The judge of the adequacy or inadequacy of the protection that the victim has had from domestic law is, obviously, the European Court, whose duty it is to apply Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights to ascertain whether, in the presence of a violation of a provision of the European Convention on Human Rights, the internal law has been able to fully redress the consequences of this violation. The argument whereby, in applying Law no. 89/2001, the Italian court may follow a different interpretation from that which the European Court has given to the provisions of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (violation of which is the fact giving entitlement to the right to compensation attributed by the said national law) implies that the victim of the violation, if he or she receives reparation at national level considered inadequate by the European Court, must obtain the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights from the latter Court. This would defeat the purpose of the remedy provided for in Italian law by Law no. 89/2001 and entail a violation of the principle of the subsidiarity of the intervention of the . It is therefore necessary to concur with the European Court of Human Rights, which, in the above-mentioned decision on the Scordino application (concerning the inadequacy of the protection afforded by the Italian courts in implementing Law no. 89/2001), affirmed that “it follows from the principle of subsidiarity ... that the national courts must, where possible, interpret and apply domestic law in accordance with the Convention”. ... The preparatory documents of Law no. 89/2001 are even more explicit. In the report concerning the bill of Senator Pinto (proceedings of the Senate no. 3813 of 16February 1999) it is affirmed that the compensatory mechanism proposed in the legislative initiative (and then adopted by the Act) secures for the applicant “a protection analogous to that which he or she would receive in the international court”, as the direct reference to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights makes it possible to transfer to domestic level “the limits of applicability of the same provision existing at international level, limits which depend essentially on the State and on the development of the case-law of the Strasbourg authorities, especially that of the European Court of Human Rights, whose decisions must therefore guide ... the domestic court in the definition of these limits”. ... 6.– The considerations expounded in sections 3-5 of the document refer in general to the importance of the interpretative guidance of the on the implementation of Law no. 89/2001 with regard to reparation for non-pecuniary damage. In this particular instance, however, any possibility for the national court to exclude non-pecuniary damage (despite having found a violation of Article6 of the European Convention on Human Rights) must be considered as non-existent because such is precluded by the previous decision of the European Court which, with reference to the same proceedings, had already ascertained that the unjustified delay in reaching a decision had had consequences involving non-pecuniary damage for the applicant, which the Court itself redressed for a limited period. From such a decision of the it follows that, once the national court has ascertained that the violation has continued in the period following that considered in the said decision, the applicant has continued to suffer non-pecuniary damage, which must be compensated for in application of Law no. 89/2001. It cannot therefore be maintained – as the Rome Court of Appeal has done – that compensation is not due because of the small amounts at stake in the proceedings in question. Such a reason, apart from being rendered immaterial by the fact that the European Court has already ruled that non-pecuniary damage had been sustained because of delay in the same action, is in any case incorrect, because the amount of what is at stake in an action in which non-compliance with reasonable time-limits has been ascertained can never have the effect of excluding non-pecuniary damage, given that the anxiety and distress resulting from the length of the proceedings normally also occur in cases in which the amounts at stake are small; hence this aspect may have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation but not of totally excluding it. 7– In conclusion the decision appealed against must be quashed and the case remitted to the Rome Court of Appeal, which, in a different composition, will order payment to the applicant of the non-pecuniary damages payable as a result of the violation of the reasonable-time requirement for the period following 16 April 1996 alone, taking as a reference point payments of the same kind of damages by the European Court of Human Rights, from which it may diverge, but only to a reasonable extent (HR Court, 27 March 2003, Scordino v. Italy)”.>Case-law on the transfer of the right to compensation 25.The Court of Cassation held as follows: 26.The Court of Cassation judges noted that the right to compensation for a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time derived from the Pinto Act. The mechanism set in place by the European standard did not give applicants a cause of action before the domestic courts. Accordingly, the right to “just satisfaction” could neither be acquired nor transferred by a person who had already died by the time the Pinto Act came into force. The fact that the deceased had, while alive, lodged an application with the was not decisive. Section 6 of the Pinto Act did not constitute, as the applicants had maintained, a procedural standard bringing about a transfer of powers from the to the domestic courts. 27.In this case, which concerned the possibility or otherwise of transferring to heirs the right to compensation deriving from a breach of Article 6 § 1 on account of the length of the proceedings, the First Division of the Court of Cassation referred the case to the full court indicating that there was a conflict between the case-law authorities, that is, between the restrictive approach taken by the Court of Cassation in the earlier judgments regarding heirs and the Pinto Act and the four judgments delivered by the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, on 26 January 2004 to the extent that a less strict interpretation would lead to the conclusion that this right to compensation has existed since Italy ratified the European Convention on 4August 1955. 28.In the case giving rise to the order mentioned above referring the case to the full court (see preceding paragraph), the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, established the following principles, thus preventing any further conflicting decisions being given by the courts: (i) Law no.848 of 4 August 1955, which ratified the Convention and made it enforceable, introduced into domestic legal order the fundamental rights, belonging to the category of rights conferred on the individual by public law, provided for in the first section of the Convention and which correspond to a large extent with those set forth in Article 2 of the Constitution. In that respect the Convention provisions are confirmatory and illustrative. ... (ii) It is necessary to reiterate the principle that the act giving rise to the right to reparation conferred by domestic law corresponds to a breach of the provision in Article 6 of the Convention, which is immediately applicable in domestic law. The distinction between the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, introduced by the European Convention on Human Rights (or even pre-existing as a constitutionally protected value), and the right to equitable reparation, which was allegedly introduced only by the Pinto Act, cannot be allowed in so far as the protection provided by the domestic courts does not depart from that previously offered by the Strasbourg Court, the domestic courts being bound to comply with the case-law of the European Court. ... (iii) Accordingly, the right to equitable reparation for loss sustained as a result of the unreasonable length of proceedings prior to the entry into force of Law no. 89/2001 must be acknowledged by the domestic courts even in favour of the heirs of a party who introduced the proceedings before that date, subject only to the condition that the claim has not already been lodged with the Strasbourg Court and the Court has not ruled on admissibility. ... 29.This judgment of the Court of Cassation concerned an appeal by the Ministry of Justice challenging the Court of Appeal’s award of non-pecuniary damages to a juristic person. The Court of Cassation referred to the decision reached in the case of Comingersoll v. Portugal [GC], no.35382/97, ECHR 2000IV and, after referring to the four judgments of the full court delivered on 26 January 2004, found that its own case-law was not in line with the European Court. It held that there was no legal barrier to awarding just satisfaction to “juristic” persons according to the criteria of the . Accordingly, since the Court of Appeal had correctly decided the case the appeal was dismissed. 30.The Court of Cassation made the following observations: “... [Whereas] non-pecuniary damage is the normal, albeit not automatic, consequence of a breach of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, it will be deemed to exist, without it being necessary to specifically prove it (directly or by presumption), on the basis of the objective fact of the breach, on condition that there are no special circumstances indicating the absence of any such damage in the actual case concerned (Cass. A.P. 26 January 2004 nos. 1338 and 1339). 31.In the report CM/Inf/DH(2004)23, revised on 24 September 2004, the Ministers’ deputies made the following indications regarding an assessment of the Pinto remedy: 32.In this interim resolution the Ministers’ deputies indicated as follows: “The Committee of Ministers Noting ... 33.The European Commission for the efficiency of justice was set up at the Council of Europe by Resolution Res(2002)12 with the aim of (a)improving the efficiency and the functioning of the justice of member States with a view to ensuring that everyone within their jurisdiction can enforce their legal rights effectively, thereby generating increased confidence of the citizens in the justice system and (b) enabling a better implementation of the international legal instruments of the Council of Europe concerning efficiency and fairness of justice. 34.In its framework programme (CEPEJ (2004) 19 Rev 2 § (7) the CEPEJ noted that “the mechanisms which are limited to compensation are too weak and do not adequately incite the States to modify their operational process, and provide compensation only a posteriori in the event of a proven violation instead of trying to find a solution for the problem of delays.”",2006,1,1.0,"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY
